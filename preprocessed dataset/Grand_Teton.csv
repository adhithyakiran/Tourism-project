0,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available,"Argyle, TX, ",Amazing National Park,"Grand Teton is one of the most beautiful national parks that I have visited. Kudos to the Rockefeller family for bringing it into existence. Jenny Lake, Cathedral Peaks, many overlooks provide inspiring beauty. Postings throughout the park offer insight into its historical and geological history. Beautiful foliage and wildlife sightings add to the memorable experience."
1,Grand_Teton,Oct 2021 , Family,"Cedar Lake, IN ",Cuz in your GTNP,"GTNP Was a great tour Ecotours a great success. Steve our driver was able to show us 11 mouse, a bunch of prong horn antelope, a herd of elk. It was aw inspiring BEAUTIFUL  Scenery. Mnts were snow caped"
2,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available, ,Absolutely One of the Most Beautiful National Parks,"We stayed in a campground within the park. Each day we were driving to different parts of the park, always stopping to take photos (the mountains are ever changing during the day). We even drove up through the southern entrance of Yellowstone National Park. This was mid-September - ended up in our first snow storm of the year! The roads were getting closed, we were able to stop at the Grant Village where only one small store remained open because of the snow."
3,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available,"Phoenix, AZ, ",Hazy Day,On our way out of Yellowstone going south and you reach Grand Teton NP. Can't miss it and I always like to stop for the iconic photo of the lake in front of the Mountains. But this year there was no lake. It has receded back so far that you can barely see the water. But the Mountains are amazing. Had some haze from fires or just from the weather so the photos aren't as crisp as I usually get.
4,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021 , Family,"Bryson City, NC ",Majestic,Breathtaking views! Gorgeous landscape. Immersive in nature. I suggest visiting in September. The trees turn a golden hue that seems to glow.
5,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available,"Redondo Beach, CA ",Beautiful National Park,"You can see much of the park in 1 full day by going around the main loop. You must include a stop at Jenny Lake. Like many people, we took the shuttle to the other side to shorten the hike up to Inspiration Point. (BTW, the bathrooms at this stop were the largest and cleanest of any we encountered in YS or GT.) There are many turn outs along the loop for great pictures. If you decide to drive up the road to the top of Signal Mountain, be aware there is a small parking lot before you reach the top. Continue past this to get to the top and see a sweeping view of the entire valley below. (This last part of the road did not show up on Google Maps, so we were a little worried.) This last part is also narrower than most of the road before it."
6,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available,"Portland, OR ",Grand Tetons,The name of this site is right on the money they are magnificent and well worth the time and travel i was dealing with smoke in the area from the forest fires so it made my pictures a little fuzzy but it didn't ruin my trip one of the great wonders of the world
7,Grand_Teton,Aug 2021,not available,"Durham, NC ",A wonderful place to visit,"I was surprised to see herds of bison in this park. There are also moose, bear, and elk here. The valley is quite attractive with many picnic spots available to enjoy. Where ever you go you can't avoid the Tetons though as they tower over the valley."
8,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available,"Tampa, FL, ",Must See National Park,"This park has moose & bear viewing opportunities, plus the stunning views of the Tetons just can not be compared to Yellowstone NP just North. There are plenty of scenic drives that can betaken to really get some epic views of the craggy Tetons (bring binoculars) . But in order to really appreciate this NP you will have to get out of your vehicle and do some day hiking. Hitting the trails will open up so much more!"
9,Grand_Teton,Aug 2021,not available,"Williamsville, NY ",National Parks are Awesome!,"Beautiful Grand Teton mountain range. The landscape is so different for each national park. Did a little hike around Lake Jenny. We only spent about a half day there. Once it was dark, nothing to see. I was hoping to see Moose, but no luck."
10,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available,"Huntington Beach, California, United States ",Spectacular landscape,Our first visit to this majestic mountain range towering above the Jackson Hole area. Unfortunately during our 2 day visit the mountains were shadowed by smoke and haze from the western forest fires. We did however manage to snap some photos the closer we were able to get near the mountains. Viewing the Snake River up close was another highlight.
11,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021 , Family,Idaho ,Hike,"Favorite place to hike. No where like it. Take your time, get out of your car. Get to the bottom of the Tetons and look up. Amazing"
12,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available,"Minneapolis, MN, ","In late afternoon, a photographer's paradise!","The Grand Tetons is one of our favorite national parks, and one that we love to visit in the last hour before the sun dips below the peaks. Here you can film light, shadow, and light and shadow combined. It just takes a few tricks to defeat the sun that is trying to ruin your photographs with a bright flare.  Here is the first trick to film directly into the sun: find a tree with a thick enough stump so that you can position yourself and not see the sun. If you can't see the sun, the sun can't invade the lens of your camera! Use the trunk fully to conceal the sun, and shoot what the lens gives you with the trunk framing to left or right.  Second, zoom in as tight as possible on an object at the center of the image.  And third, of course, wait until the sun has slid behind one peak, but is still brightly illuminating another! Photography is fun!"
13,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021,not available,"Bethesda, MD ",Ana Rode made our trip to the Tetons better,"My wife and I (both older than most of you) spent 5 days in the Grand Tetons in Mid September 2021. The best past of the trip was our tour guide for the first day, Ana Rode of Ana's Grand Excursions in Jackson. Ana turned out to be informative, energetic and organized. She took us all over the park, showed us where to go on subsequent days and in fact, organized our whole stay in the Tetons. We had a wonderful visit: hiking to several lakes, viewing moose and other animals close-up, finding good meals (both lunches and dinners), star-gazing with Wyoming Stargazers, and genuinely enjoying every moment. I have used many guides over the world and would rate Ana Rode as the very best and would certainly recommend her for a visit to the Tetons and Yellowstone, especially early in your visit so that she can get you happily organized thereafter."
14,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021,not available,"Fishers, IN ",Absolutely breathtaking,"We made sure we spent some time in the Grand Tetons as part of our trip to Yellowstone. We knew two days was not going to be enough, but we were so glad that we made this happen. That just means we will have to come back again. The mountains were so spectacular that they looked fake, especially at dusk. There isn't a bad spot to view them and it almost got monotonous because every mile you drove, the view changed and it looked just as amazing as the last mile. We wanted to take a thousand pictures. There is so much to do in the area and if you don't feel like doing anything, you can just find a comfy spot and sit and admire the beauty."
15,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Shoreview, MN ",Amazing scenery,"We had an awesome visit.The mountains are amazing.There are so many areas to see and take photos.Many places to go hiking,bike riding, fishing,walking,looking for wildlife or just driving.We happen to see moose,elk,badger,big horn sheep, pronghorn and rabbits.This is a place to not to be missed.I would say to get to the park early as lots fill up fast.You can always find parking you may just have to walk a little further as the day goes by.We recommend highly."
16,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021 , Couples,Tyler ,Wonderfully Scenic,Enjoyed the scenic drive along the lakes and mountains. The trail to Inspiration Point was outstanding with incredible views along the way.
17,Grand_Teton,Sep 2021 , Family,"Hollywood, FL, ",The best park to go!,"We just love this park, so many animals to see, hicking places, lakes, you name it. We absolutely enjoy all the views too. Amazing place!"
18,Grand_Teton,Aug 2021,not available,"Maumee, OH ",Breath Taking!,"I loved this park and wish I had more time to explore it! The views are just spectacular. How the mountains are with the sky provides several breath taking views. Photos do not do justice to how beautiful this area is in person. The park provides lots of opportunities for hiking for all abilities. There are hikes for the novice to the most experienced hiker. There are several bike trails if you are into biking. I am not. The key to this park is GO EARLY! By mid morning it gets crowded. We always went early to our hikes and had no problems with parking. One hike by Jenny Lake, we were finished by about 11:00 a.m. and the parking lots were full and people were parking on the entrance drive and on the highway."
19,Grand_Teton,Aug 2021,not available,"Rochester, MN, ",Majestic,Just one of many beautiful peaks in the area. Easy to seen from many areas. Worth a gaze most certainly.
20,Grand_Teton,Jul 2021,not available,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Spectacular,"Me and my 13 yo grandson spent two days in GTNP in July and I wish I had more time. The scenery is absolutely spectacular. Go early to avoid traffic at the gate; we were in the park by 7 a.m. We couldn’t do a lot of hiking because I have a bad knee but that didn’t detract from the trip at all. We loved it! The most traffic we saw was at Jenny Lake and it was very, very crowded with lots of people parked on the side of the road. I planned this trip in my head for 10 years and I was not disappointed. I’ll be going back soon and if you are thinking about going, do it! You won’t be disappointed."
21,Grand_Teton,Aug 2021,not available,"Columbia, MD, ",Beautiful Park,"Since we came directly from Yellowstone, we were pleasantly surprised when we did not have to go through the visitor entrance for Grand Teton. To see some of the recommended spots in the park, such as Moose Wilson road, you actually have to leave the park and if you want to come back in, you have to go back through an entrance. Luckily, traffic was not backed up for miles like other parks, so it was not too bad when reentering. The Jenny Lake visitor center has traffic parked a half mile down the road, so we opted out of visiting the Jenny Lake area. We did, however, drive down the Jenny Lake scenic route which gave pretty views. The other recommended spots that we also enjoyed was the Mormon Row Historic District which has a picturesque barn that has a great photo op of a barn with the Teton mountains in the background which is a popular spot for sunrise. There is also a chapel with the Teton mountains in the background called the Chapel of the Transfiguration. Perhaps it was too late in the day, but we saw one bison in the distance and a squirrel (or mouse) eating food from the ground next to our car as the only two animals. Compared to Yellowstone, this park is not as crowded, but in my opinion, it offers just as good of views and should not be skipped."
22,Grand_Teton,Aug 2021,not available,Wisconsin ,Beautiful,Nice stop on way to Yellowstone. Colter bay campground has some great sites  Beautiful scenery and easy check in.
23,Grand_Teton,Aug 2021,not available,"Manchester, MD ",Absolutely stunning,This is a great place to see stunning views as well as see a lot of wildlife. There are also informative Ranger Programs in the evenings.
24,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021,not available, ,Breathtaking views!,"We explored the Grand Teton National Park while we were camping at Yellowstone and wow was it worth it!! This place is gorgeous!! Every place is beautiful and jaw dropping. It was suggest going counter clockwise when entering into the park and it was great, especially when visiting String Lake and Jenny Lake which is a one way loop. We chose which stops we wanted to look at and even ate our picnic at one of the pull offs. Highly recommend visiting this amazing, beautiful place!"
25,Grand_Teton,Jul 2021,not available,"Denver, CO ",The cooler park,"Absolutely loved the park. The mountains are gorgeous with their jagged structure. The jenny lake, hidden falls and inspiration point combined stop was the best thing we did in either Grand Teton or Yellowstone. Definitely alot less crowded and more enjoyable than Yellow stone. A bit more variety of stops as well."
26,Grand_Teton,Jul 2021,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Grand Teton Park > Yellowstone,"This is just a review for the whole of Grand Teton National Park, even though this page is technically just for the specific mountain. We visited the park on a Wednesday in July and experienced very little traffic. We were able to get to all the major sites with relative ease. We also visited Yellowstone the following day, and both of us agreed that we liked this park better. The views/scenery is just absolutely incredible. If you are planning on visiting the region or Yellowstone, DO NOT skip this park."
27,Grand_Teton,Jul 2021,not available,"Mount Laurel, NJ ",Wonderful National Park .,Awesome views all over !! We stayed in the park for 2 nights I loved going to mormon row . Seeing lots of wildlife . The weather was beautiful every day the wild fires had just started to smoke us out . The pictures I took are so nice. It's great to reflect back on our trip .
28,Grand_Teton,Jul 2021 , Family,"Denison, TX ",Literally the prettiest place I’ve been!,"I have always heard how pretty the Tetons were, but I didn’t believe it until I saw them with my own eyes! The view from Jenny Lake was amazing!!!"
29,Grand_Teton,Jul 2021,not available,Michigan ,Grand Tetons,"Grand Teton is a beautiful park with lots of mountain views. IF you can find parking, some of the hikes are great, but parking fills up by 8am, so arrive early if that's on your list of must do things. Otherwise, drive through the park and stop at the pullouts to take great mountain photos."
30,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021,not available,"Honolulu, HI, ",just beautiful,The park wasn't too crowded in mid-june. We could find parking at most of the lookouts. The scenery was just gorgeous.
31,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021,not available,"Birch Run, MI, ",Beautiful park,We loved Grand Teton National Park. The views were amazing. Around every corner it seemed we needed to stop and take pictures. Beautiful doesn't come close to describing the views.
32,Grand_Teton,May 2021,not available,"Ash Fork, AZ, ",Please take your time,"Only thing that could have made this trip better was if the rain stayed away for the first 4 days/nights. Spectacular, incredible, breath-taking, awe inspiring...words can not fully explain the beauty of this National Park. There is no ""one place"" you need to see, you can find amazing views everywhere. Take your time and let the park come to you. We tried to avoid the crowds near animal jams and were rewarded several times with surprises with few other visitors near us."
33,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021 , Family,"Doylestown, PA, ",Amazing views!,"One of the best parks ever! Lots of wildlife and scenery is awesome! Make sure to find some great pics of the Tetons, just awesome scenery. Mormon row seems to be the best spot we found to take photos, but many exist in the park. Park is huge but worth it!"
34,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021 , Friends,"Los Angeles, CA ",Beautiful Snow Mountain View,"Very great long trails around the mountain. Beautiful lakes and grassland. The lake is nearby the mountain, and the scenery is great. The trails are all around the snow mountains."
35,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021 , Couples,"Palmetto, FL ",Awesome natural wonder,"This was our second visit, the last one being 16 years ago. The views are fabulous with many pullout to get different angles. For hikers there are plenty of trails. This is a must see before or after Yellowstone."
36,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021,not available,"Muskegon, MI ",Such Beautiful Mountains!,"We stayed near the park in Idaho and traveled there two days. The trip to the park and around some of the scenic  roads was about two hundred miles per day! We hiked quite a few of the short paths, and saw fewer than expected animals. Stay in the park if you can and get up and around early!"
37,Grand_Teton,May 2021,not available, ,Stunning!,"We loved our time in GTNP! Stunning views everywhere you look. We saw tons of wildlife - moose, elk, pronghorn, bison, fox, beaver and a grizzly. Our 6yr old loved the least chipmunks - curious and spunky little things! We tackled hikes to Hidden Falls/Inspiration Point, Taggert Lake and Phelps Lake. String Lake was a great location to do a little splashing (but very cold!). We're from the east coast and I highly recommend not adjusting to the local time and getting an early start (it helped a lot with the crowds). While some trailhead parking lots were full and overflowing, there were still plenty of opportunities to escape people."
38,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021,not available,"Vallejo, CA, ",Wyoming is Awesome,"Beautiful area and lots of photo ops. Disappointing that we did not see any wildlife, but that's the chance you take. Wyoming is an awesome state with mountains and valleys. A bonus with Jackson Hole just down the road. I could live in Jackson Hole."
39,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021 , Couples,"Williamsburg, VA, ",One of the Most Beautiful Mountain Ranges,"After departing Jackson Hole, WY my next stop was Grand Teton NP on the way to Yellowstone NP. It’s a great place to sightsee and do day activities at Jenny Lake. We hit the lookouts and had lunch on the beach at Jenny Lake. The back setting of the beautiful mountains are absolutely fantastic."
40,Grand_Teton,May 2021 , Couples,United States ,Majestic,"Majestic, awesome, beautiful, spiritual. This park is a must see on your national park bucket list. From Jackson to the entrance to Yellowstone entrance you will find plenty of jaw dropping views coupled with bears, moose and bison. Take advantage of the pullouts and off road trails. Take bear spray when hiking because it’s no joke that bears live in the Tetons."
41,Grand_Teton,Jun 2021,not available,"San Francisco, CA ",An Inspirationally Beautify National Park,Every view is spectacular. Impossible to take a bad photo.  Natural Beauty and wildlife abound.  NOT TO BE MISSED!
42,Grand_Teton,Jul 2020,not available,"Saint Paul, MN ",Awe Inspiring,This was my first time at this amazing park. I don’t think I can put into words how beautiful it is. A must see for National Park lovers.
43,Grand_Teton,May 2021 , Couples,"Huber Heights, OH ",My Favorite National Park!!,"I absolutely love this gorgeous national park! If you have limited time the entire park can be seen in a day but I recommend at least 3 or 4 days in order to take your time and enjoy some of the hikes. There are several hikes ranging from easy to strenuous. The current cost is $35 per car for a week pass, or you can purchase an annual national park pass for $80, which gives you access to all national parks, national monuments, and forests! If you are 62 or older take advantage of the lifetime pass for $80! No masks are currently required if you are fully immunized. Make sure to keep up to date on road closures and openings thru the the nps.gov website."
44,Grand_Teton,May 2021,not available,"Fort Worth, TX ",Majestic Beauty!,"We spent time in the park on two consecutive days and still didn't see everything. The first day was cold with a consistent wintry mix of rain, sleet and snow, so we couldn't get any good pics of the mountain tops. Second day was perfect. Lots of great pics. We crossed if off our bucket list, but God willing, we will be back with RV in tow."
45,Grand_Teton,May 2021,not available,"Pierre, SD ",Wow what views,"This is a great place. The beauty of this park is on par with anything else in the US. Amazing lakes, mtns and what not. When you are here, you need to see Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point"
46,Grand_Teton,May 2021,not available,"Weatherford, OK ",Breathtakingly Amazing!,"Grand Teton is absolutely breath taking and a must bucket list item. We spent 2 days in the park before heading to Yellowstone and had an absolute blast. Just driving the loop road is a rewarding experience for the less mobile but for the more adventurous stop as often as you can and explore. Meaner's Landing was really cool. Lots of hiking trails--some relatively easy and some relatively hard--just ask at the visitor center (Moose) for a map and other descriptions.    Pro-Tip--if you can, bring a picnic lunch. There are places to eat in the park but few and they are crowded and relatively expensive. We enjoyed a great picnic lunch of some cold cuts, cheese and fruit we picked up in Jackson while looking at the vistas and as we ate a bison herd and several Pronghorn's wandered through the area. No place offers that view!    One more thing--be prepared for sudden weather changes. We experienced 3 seasons in 2 days. Dress in layers and peel off and put on as the day goes by."
47,Grand_Teton,May 2021,not available, ,Beautiful Park,"Mountain views and wildlife viewing is incredible. Saw grizzlies, moose, elk, pronghorn antelope, and bison. Snow still on mountains in May."
48,Grand_Teton,May 2021 , Couples,"Los Angeles, CA ",So peaceful,"We spent a lovely day here after spending 3 wonderful days in Yellowstone. So glad we did. As a huge bonus, we got to see a Grizzly family of mommy and 4 cubs that we didn't get to see at Yellowstone. It was so exciting!!"
49,Grand_Teton,May 2021,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Wonderful scenery.,"The park does not have a lot of wildlife (that we saw). however, the view is breathtaking and the drives are stunning. You can spend a day if you are short on time."
50,Grand_Teton,Apr 2021 , Family, ,Beautiful scenery,"We visited grand Teton national park on 24th of April 2021. The drive to grand Teton national park was awesome. The mountains looked beautiful. As we planned to visit Yellowstone after grand Teton; we purchased a one day pass for $15. Walking with little kids was tough in the cold weather, we went halfway to Jenny lake but turned back.  I would definitely come when the roads are open to check the whole park."
51,Grand_Teton,Mar 2021,not available,"Frisco, TX ",Mind Blowing Hollywood Set Scenes,When you deplane at the airport the first view that you experience is the Grand Teton. The scenery almost does not look real. You have to stop to take it all in. Driving to the entrance of the Grand Tetons National Forest we experienced cinematic views and wildlife encounters.
52,Grand_Teton,Jul 2020,not available,"New York City, NY ",Do not skip if going to Yellowstone!,"Although smaller than Yellowstone, I think this is much more majestic and beautiful than Yellowstone. Last year I came here TWICE, during winter and during summer. Definitely recommend summer as winter has a lot of roads closed, unplowed. The hiking is great of course but it's got a recently installed (renovated?) biking trail system that is the best I've ever seen at national parks. It's an absolute joy to be biking through the trails and having that gorgeous mountain range to your left or right. If you're going to Yellowstone, it's just a short ride farther south. It would be such a shame if you missed this while already there."
53,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020,not available,"Randolph, NJ ",Magnificent vistas,"Well worth the stay to see this wonderful park. We are driving cross country and Yellowstone was too big and cold for this trip. An hour or so south is the Grand Teton Park. IT is beautiful and manageable for a short trip. We went to Signal Mountain Rd, and looked at Jackson Lake, drove up the overlook to see the scenic view which is magnificent, drove done to North Jenny Lake entrance and walked around String Lake and part of Leigh Lake. Admired the view everywhere we went. Was a wonderful day and turned out to be a warm warm one even in October (the next day snowed so no hiking for us)!"
54,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020 , Couples,"Harrison, AR ",Tetons,The drive there and the views are wonderful. Beautiful!we drove from casper wy. So many different landscapes along the way.
55,Grand_Teton,Sep 2020 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA ",Picture-perfect serenity,"There are plenty of stunningly beautiful national parks in the USA, each a special place in their own way—including Yellowstone, right next door to Grand Teton...    ...But of all the national parks I’ve been to (I’ve visited 17 different ones as of writing this review), very few inspired unbridled awe as quickly as Grand Teton did.    I went for a morning hike by Jenny Lake and was absolutely captivated by the reflection of Grand Teton over the water.    It was quite possibly the most picture-perfect serene place I’ve ever been to.    If you’re in the area, whether to ski or visit Yellowstone, Grand Teton is a must-stop. You definitely won’t regret it."
56,Grand_Teton,Nov 2020 , Solo,"South Bend, IN ",My second time here,This was my second time at GTNP and it was as good as the first. Plenty of different trails to see something different every time.
57,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020,not available,"Saint Paul, MN ",Amazing,"We visited in second week of October during the Covid pandemic. It was stunning! We were past the fall colors and it was cooler (30-50 degree days with some Rain and snow) but even with some clouds and rain, it was beautiful! We drove the loop more than once stopping at many of the stops/viewpoints. My favorites were Shawbachers Landing, Oxbow bend and Mormon row. If you like photography, make sure to walk around and check our all of the buildings in Mormon row area. Also, sunrise, try to catch the alpine glow over the mountains just after the sunrises. See photo I took from Glacier viewpoint (I’m just an amateur) - if you can’t make it on time to the top sites for sunrise or sunset, you can find many other great viewpoints like that one. Many places were closed in the park when we went otherwise. And, we didn’t hike much because it was cold. But, so much to see by just driving the loop."
58,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020 , Solo,"Seattle, WA ",I didn’t see a Bear,"I hiked around Jenny Lake and photographed the sunset. The next day I drove around the park, looking for fantastic views and animals. But please be careful driving, pay attention don’t hit the animals or each other. Have fun."
59,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020,not available, ,This is it!,Grand Teton is beautiful and spectacular! Driving around is easy and the sights are wonderful.  Many places to stop and take pictures.  Also several hike destinations which are amazing.
60,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020 , Couples,"Portsmouth, NH ",Stunning scenery,We visited the Grand Tetons in early October and loved the stunning mountains and scenery. We did 3 hikes and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. Highly recommend spending some time here.
61,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020,not available,"Sao Leopoldo, RS ",Beautiful,Beautiful. My wife and I drove and drove. It snowed that morning so there was a fresh layer of the white stuff. Grand Teton is absolutely stunning. Take your time and take it all in.
62,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020,not available,"West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA ",Gorgeous,Outstanding place to visit for hiking or just a beautiful drive around the park. We saw plenty of animals and the mountains are breathtaking.
63,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020 , Couples,"Johnson City, TN, ",Breathtaking,I have no words. Seeing the Teton mountain range has been a dream of mine for years. I stood there and wept. The grandeur. The ruggedness. The peace. We actually stayed in Idaho Falls and drove in every day to witness the rising of the sun and everything these mountains had to offer. Jenny Lake outlook is a must.
64,Grand_Teton,Sep 2020,not available,"Ellicott City, MD ",Bucket klist item checked off,"Fabulous hikes, scenic loops, sights and wildlife sightings. spent two and halfdays touring the park and wished we had more time. Definitely a must see and experience in your lifetime."
65,Grand_Teton,Aug 2020,not available, ,"Gorgeous scenery, as usual, but the Nat. Pk. Service didn't have the ability to keep things open.","You can't beat the scenery of Grand Teton, but with millions of visitors over the year the Park Service didn't keep restaurants or accommodations open within the park which greatly added to problems trying to visit the place. If places could be open in Jackson like they were there's no reason the government couldn't have kept places open within the park. To us it seems like usual government incompetence. It was the same for Yellowstone as many people told us."
66,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020,not available,california ,Amazing!,"Absolutely beautiful! The Teton peaks are amazing and the meadows are gorgeous. The golden leaves of the Aspen trees, in all their yellow glory, against the powerful gray of the mountains is something I won't soon forget. We were lucky enough to see a bison, a moose and her baby, and many pronghorn sheep during our drive. Jenny Lake is absolutely serene and crystal clear! It truly is uplifting and joyful to take some time in the Grand Tetons park. Please note, however, that signage is a bit misleading in the park. Along the main road, before turning into GTNP, a sign says that Yellowstone is 55 miles away. Yes, it is... to the very border of Yellowstone. Old Faithful Geyser is another 1.5 or 2 hours away into Yellowstone. Also, within GTNP intself, many of the stopping points ( restaurants, gas stations, gift shops, etc.) are closed at this point in the year. The only indication of this is right at the entrance to the Park where you pay to go in. If you miss the posting, you will not know that the service area you're aiming for is closed. One last mention is that Jenny Lake is certainly worth stopping at. Smaller than Jackson Lake, it is nonetheless gorgeous. There is a sign saying that a good hike near the lake is 2.8 miles. Not being hikers, or even having water or such for a hike, we decided to do it. But we could not figure out what the 2.8 mile length brought you to. There are no further signs. It is clear to the eye that the lake is definitely a long hike to go all around, probably more like 10 miles at least. There was mention of a waterfall at some point, but again no signage to tell you where. We asked people coming the other way what their experience was. Many had hiked for a greater part of the day and since it was 3:30 p.m. or so, they did not advise going onward. (Plus, they probably summed us up as ""newbies"" too.) Hate to say anything at all negative about GTNP because the visit was something I will never forget... beautiful, wild, stunning. Just a few more signs or notices or such would make it a more time managed and safer experience."
67,Grand_Teton,Oct 2020 , Family,"Charlotte, NC ",Beautiful,We spent all our time at Yellowstone but couldn’t resist going home through the Grand Tetons. I’m so glad we did. The mountains are amazing.

Our only regret is we did not see wildlife. So glad we got to experience the Grand Teton National Park. Don't miss it.
70,Grand_Teton,Sep 2020,not available,"Arlington, VA, ",Soaring mountains and intimate trails,"Grand Tetons is overshadowed by nearby Yellowstone, but is worth visiting in its own right. The main feature of Grand Tetons is the mountain peaks, which can be seen from the roads, as well as up close on the many miles of backcountry trails. The highlights included stunning Taggart Lake and beautiful Hidden Falls. The trails at Grand Tetons are not as crowded as those at Yellowstone, and I think it's no coincidence that I saw a black bear and a moose here rather than at Yellowstone. This is also a more manageable park than Yellowstone. While you could spend a week hiking the trails, you can also hit the highlights in just a few hours."
71,Grand_Teton,Sep 2020,not available,"Wichita Falls, TX ",Grand Teton's,"Just Beautiful, lots of nature so many people out exercising and just being active with family.

If doing a trip to Yellowstone, I would definitely recommend a day or two for Grand Teton National Park. It offers striking contrast to Yellowstone and awe inspiring beauty.  Arrive early to get a parking spot at popular trails and picnic spots. This is a beautiful national park, not to be missed if in that part of the country.  Services are available and some shops, stores, food service and visitor centers are open. Restrooms are available and maintained. The Jenny Lake shuttle is in operation."

This smaller national park is loaded with places and things to see. Our 10 year old liked it better the Yellowstone. We got a chance to see bear 399 and her 4 cubs as well what a treat.

It’s beauty never seems to get old. There are a few roads that gives you access to the east side of the mountains, the the real beauty is hiking the many miles of trails away from the roadside overlooks. This trip we saw elk in rut, a herd of about 200 bison, a number of herds of pronghorn antelope, bald eagles and numerous waterfowl and birds. The fall color with the turning aspen was spectacular. I highly recommend this park to anyone, whether you enjoy the drive, day hiking or backpacking."

82,Grand_Teton,Sep 2020 , Family,"Poquoson, VA ",We did it. Made it to the Top of the Grand Teton Selta lake,To all how want a great day hike ! I suggest the Delta Lake Via Amphitheater Trail! It’s a hard trail but worth it. We started at 9am and ended at 4pm . I would not suggest staying to much longer then 5 due to you want to make sure you have enough daylight! The day we went in September was beautiful. Not to cold/ not to hot! But this is for people who can climb over boulders/Rocks and thin wet mucky parts of the trail! Not for children but 15 and up. Not for wimpy kids.

92,Grand_Teton,Sep 2020 , Family, ,Traffic through the campsites,"We went backpacking for two nights on Leigh lake with our kids and some friends. Really disappointed how the trail comes right through the camps instead of routing around. All day long we had hikers wandering through camp, some playing Loud music. All of them were friendly enough, but it’s just annoying when you try to find some peace and quiet in the mountains in a reserved campsite only to have hikers wandering through all day. It wouldn’t be difficult route that main trail around the campsites."

Took a hike to the Hidden falls and cascade canyon, which had great views (Inspiration Point) and some animals (deer), and also did a river tour of the snake river, were we saw some bald eagles and amazing views of the peaks. Not as many animals as was expecting, but it's likely we just had bad luck."

The first day was mostly sitting drives on Teton Park Road past the lakes. While at Jenny Lake we got word that Bear # 399 was running around the snake river with her four cubs. This itself is a miracle for a grizzly to have four cubs. The next day was spent climbing into Delta lake. We made the mistake of not seeing the Helen that was placed on the trail head leading into the lake and ended up going all the way up to disappointment peak. This was an additional two extra hours of climbing but well worth the view."
102,Grand_Teton,Aug 2020,not available,"Oviedo, FL ","Great mountains, long drive","Mountains were beautiful. If you are into hiking or boating, probably a great place to go, but not really worth the drive if you are just sight seeing.

If I had the pleasure of time, I’d go picture taking in the morning and do everything else like hiking etc in the afternoon to evening. But since our time was very limited, we went around starting at around 9 towards Teton road all the way to Moose and up towards Moran junction and back to Colter Bay. We started late since we came from West Yellowstone where we left at past 7am. We only did picture taking all throughout. But the activities inside the park are endless, from hiking to biking etc. There’s this bike trail where you can roller skate/blade as well and it’s a very long route!

From the parking lot and all hikes in the area you are blown away by the view of Grand Teton and Mount Moran. We took a hike around the visitor center and along the lake and even on a cloudy day it was beautiful. That being said, for our money, the 2 mountains are about the only spectacular sights in this park. We did the entire loop road and once you get far enough east, it is pretty unspectacular.

This is the youngest range of mountains in North American, rising abruptly from the valley of Jackson Hole with no foothills. In the winter, ranger led snow shoe hikes or cross country skiing in the park are delightful diversions from a week of skiing or snowboarding. In fact, many come only for wildlife tours and sleigh rides or dogsledding just outside of the park and never even strap on a board or two whilst here! It is a breathtaking locale I hope you find."

First week in December and they had snow, but not enough. So we decided to drive the national park. Go on a clear or mostly clear day for stunning views of the Grand Tetons mountain range. During the afternoon we didn't see much wildlife...apparently they lay down and rest during the afternoon. We went to see Mormon row and the famous Moulton barns. We drove past Kelly, and had a fabulous lunch at Dornan's in Moose. Then decided to take one last drive through the park on our way home. We put the Science School in as our destination as we heard it was a moose hot spot...But once we got out on the park's open roads, it was easy to see the moose at far distances. We spotted three different moose groups. It was amazing. One group was by the road so we were able to get a close (yet safe) distance away. I took zoomed in pictures sticking out of the car's sunroof. Seeing the moose with the sun was setting over the amazing Grand Tetons was beyond stunning."

It covers over 300,000 acres and is home to countless species of indigenous flora and fauna. Higher elevated mountains still have small glaciers, the Snake River wends its way through the Park, and some of the oldest rocks have been found here, dating back about 2.7 billion years.    We entered at the Moran Entrance and within a couple of minutes we came face to face with Jackson Lake. This is a great photo stop as Mount Moran with its tiny glacier reflects beautifully in the lake. The topography of the Park is interesting in that the land is very very flat with the mountains suddenly rising sharply and majestically.    We stopped at the Craig Thomas Visitor Center where the staff was friendly and helpful and there were interesting exhibits. There are over 200 miles of hiking trails, and there is some good fishing, especially for trout. Camping is available. This is a very beautiful, well maintained Park."

204,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019,not available, ,GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK where grandeur weds splendor,"Grand Teton National Park  In the western part of mountainous region of United States sits its 44th state Wyoming which is tenth largest yet least populated one. Here the Great Plains meets the Rocky Mountains: actually it is a great plateau broken by mountain ranges. The eastern third of the state is high elevation prairie called the High Plains while the Rocky mountains and rangelands cover western two-third of the state.    In the northwest of Wyoming sits the Grand Teton National Park. It encompasses the Teton mountain range, the 4,000-meter Grand Teton peak [the second highest peak in the state ], and the valley in the north is known as Jackson Hole.    The Teton Range in the northwest extends for 50 miles (80 km). The Continental Divide that spans north-south across the central portion of the state, forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the Great Divide Basin where the waters that flow or precipitate into this area simply sinks into the soil or evaporates.    During June to September the weather remains a pleasant mild to warm and dry. So when we set off, after hiring a car from AVIS at Jackson Hole for 5 days, we’re spell bound by the towering mountains laced with glaciers and sweeping green valleys and vast stretches of rangelands. Even some ranches do not spoil the view simply because, it is a park of epic proportion.    The park has numerous lakes, including 15-mile-long (24 km) Jackson Lake as well as streams e.g. the upper main stem of the Snake River. A dozen small glaciers persist at the higher elevations near the highest peaks in the range. Dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, more than a dozen fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians inhabit the park.    With more than 1,000 drive-in campsites, Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking [over 320 km of hiking trails], fishing and other forms of recreation."

For large panoramic photographs and views I think this park beats out it's Yellowstone Neighbor. I would highly recommend spending at least a day here.
224,Grand_Teton,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Castle Rock, CO ",Amazing,The Grand Tetons are spectacular. It’s absolutely breathing taking from every vantage point. Such a wonderful place of solitude and beauty.
225,Grand_Teton,Sep 2019 , Couples,"San Rafael, CA ",One of my favorite National  Parks,"This park is awesome. The mountains are magnificent, the Snake River is gorgeous, all the lakes are beautiful with great views. We always try to have a drink in the Jackson Lake Lodge at sunset. There are lots of trails at all different lengths and degrees of difficulty. Don't forget binoculars to get a better view of the abundant wildlife."
226,Grand_Teton,Jul 2019,not available,"Anaheim, CA, ",Awe inspiring vistas,"The admission fee for Grand Teton National Park is paid at the entrance gate. There have been 2 places that I have visited that just took my breath away. The first was Devil's Tower and this is the second. (For the record, I have been to the Grand Canyon and Mount Rushmore and neither of them had the impact of the Tetons.) There are amazing vistas--Jenny Lake is spectacular--picnic areas, camping, visitor centers and pretty much anything you would expect at a major national park. Most people want to see Yellowstone, but on your way there, this is a worthwhile stop."
227,Grand_Teton,Sep 2019,not available,"Newberg, OR ",Amazing and Majestic,"How anyone can give this an average rating must not have experienced all the Tetons have to offer. So many ways to experience these mountains, the mountain lakes around them and the interesting history of how the Park formed, the life the Snake River brings to the area and the abundance of wildlife. There are so many pictures already posted, no need to post more, you just have to experience it, nothing matches. I will say that for those that are not total outdoors people (my wife), you may decide you have seen enough in two days if you can not experience the hikes."

Hiking the trails through the wildflowers and taking in the epic views was simply priceless and amazing. We are so lucky to have national parks, they offer so much and preserve our beautiful outdoors and wildlife. If you have time definitely do some of the longer day hikes into the wilderness, it will refresh your soul! And if you get a chance to backpack make sure you get your permit, there are backcountry rangers out there checking!"
230,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019 , Couples,United States ,Great tour of the Teton National Park,We took a tour of the Grand Teton National Park through the Headwaters Lodge. We had a very knowledgeable guide and it was a awesome time. We saw majestic mountains and calm waters. We even saw a Grisly bear.  We’ll definitely take the tour again if we can return.
231,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019 , Family,"Boston, MA ",Fantastic but only if you add Yellowstone,"Grand Teton is amazing; views, hikes and wildlife. My wife and I hiked Jenny Lake along with other smaller hikes and the scenery was incredible. We saw a moose and calf at Moose Pond near Jenny Lake. We also saw numerous antelope throughout the park.  We loved Grand Teton but would not recommend unless you also did Yellowstone. We live in Massachusetts so it was a long way to travel. We did two days in Grand Teton and five days in Yellowstone. We used a woman’s blog Barefoottheory itinerary which we followed about 80 percent and made up the other 20 percent with different hikes."

It has a loop road around the inside and has lots of lakes and wild life. The Snake River runs through the park and they offer rafting trips. The park is close to Jackson and Jackson Hole.

238,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019,not available,"Salt Lake City, UT ",A Peaceful and Beautiful Place,"We planned to go last summer, but rescheduled at the last min. due to smoke from CA fires. So glad we finally got there. Beautiful hikes next to lakes and with great mountain views. We had carefully read other's reviews and recommendations and had carefully planned the trip. This was well worth it. While the park apparently has large crowds, it is large enough to easily avoid people. The best decision we made in our planning was to get up early enough to be in the park at 7, especially for the more crowded hikes, like Jenny Lake."
239,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019,not available,"Kimberling City, MO ",Inspiring,Just go. No description is adequate and not enough adjectives to describe. Make sure you take in all the sight seeing drives.

240,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019 , Family,"Chantilly, VA ",A scenic ride on way to Yellowstone,"We went to the Yellowstone National Park via the south gate, a bonus is the scenic drive through majestic Teton mountains, and the beautiful town Jackson, the playground of the wealthy. We tried to see as much as we could so we exited Yellowstone via the East Gate with another memorable drive through Shoshone National Forrest. Anyway, Grand Teton, located in Wyoming and very far from any big town, offers beautiful scenery, camping and relaxation for the visitors. The park has fees just like Yellowstone, and it is better to buy an annual pass to visit both. At 62, getting a senior lifetime pass is even better."

The aerly Jne dates were colder than expected with frequent high country snow but we had a great time anyway. Hikes were limited to what the younger kids can do but fun. Lots of scenery to see and beautiful vistas to enjoy. Could have spent months there .
243,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019,not available,"Charlotte, NC ",Majestic Park,"We stopped in the Grand Teton park on the way to and from Yellowstone. It's a very majestic looking park due to the mountain range. Especially with the views of the mountains in the background behind various lakes. I suggest that you carry Bear Spray with you if you are hiking. There are more bear in Teton than in Yellowstone from what I understand. You will find moose near the marsh areas. There is an Elk refuge on highway 191 coming out of Jackson heading North. Our favorite hike was up to Lake Taggart. Plenty of people, not a difficult hike either, and a beautiful environment. There are maps online from the national park service for Teton."
244,Grand_Teton,Jul 2019,not available,"Parsons, KS ",Very beautiful and lots to see!,"The road from our resort to the entrance was bumpy and not great, but almost immediately after we entered the park we saw a mama moose with her baby. Let the picture taking begin! Lol"

246,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019,not available,"Willow Grove, PA ",Where to Find Moose in Grand Teton NP,"We came here after visiting Yellowstone NP to continue our wildlife scouting adventure as well as to witness the most beautiful mountain range in America. And it truly is stunningly beautiful. Just when you think you have taken enough pictures of it, then another view or angle or nuance made by light or clouds just take your breath away and there you are taking the millionth picture of it.    I was surprised however that more wildlife was not teeming the plains as we drive through and around the park. Coming from Yellowstone's famous Lamar and Hayden Valleys where majestic bison roam the fields in herds and wander solo unafraid of cars and human bystanders, I admit feeling deflated about not seeing much wildlife stand out in the miles of sagebrush. On a couple of occasions we saw 1 prong horn in the fields, hardly the herd we see grazing or resting in Lamar Valley. And this experience was true no matter what time of day we were driving out there, even during the prime time of wildlife viewing which is early morning before the August sun really heats things up.    But we were okay with all of this because on this trip we were scouting out moose. Based on our experience of scouting areas around the park starting from the wee hours of the early morning to evening, this is a review of the places we scouted:    1) Gros Ventre (pronounced Gro-Vaunt): This is where we saw moose during our 4 day stay in Grand Teton. Take 191 North from Moose Junction and make a right onto Antelope Flats Road and the road turns down around past Mormon Row again to drive you along the Gros Ventre river. I believe it was the first overlook parking area where the street is closest to the river and gives you an open view of the opposite bank and forestation along the river. This place was referred to us by a ranger who lives near the location and usually sees 3 young bull moose here. A tourist who visits each year also referred this place. Judging by the many tourists and photographers that showed up here at dusk, this was the place to see moose.    And hooray, we saw our first moose here! We saw a mama moose and her calf relaxing in the willows by the bank of the Gros Ventre River around 3:00pm. We also saw a coyote run across the street from the river back up the hill. Then a couple of days later, we saw our first bull moose across the river around 5:00pm. He stayed close to the shade and ate leaves and would just sit and rest out of sight until he got up again to eat. We hoped he would come out further to drink from the river but he didn't. He was still there at nightfall when we left.    2) Moose-Wilson Road: No luck for us here. We visited this place at 6 or 7 in the morning and drove to the look out point where there was a stream and heavy forestation on the opposite bank. The overlook parking area was extremely noisy with gravel and traffic. We drove down the bumpy road and followed the road down til we turned out and nothing. Rangers and the internet have mentioned this road as a good place to see moose but not for us.    3) Swabacher Road: Also no luck here but very beautiful area. Located a little north of Moose Junction on 191 in between Glacier and Teton overlook points, you pull into this road which you will follow down where there is parking by a rest room out-house. Then take a walk along the river where some parts look very marshy and looks like perfect habitat for moose but none were spotted here. A woman who frequents Grand Teton each year told us to come here as moose was spotted here before but again no luck for us here. We came here in the morning and late afternoon and nothing. Very picturesque view of Grand Teton here.    4) Oxbow Bend: North on Teton Park Road and make a right at Jackson Lake Junction. Travel books have mentioned this place but we did not see any moose here.    Although we only lucked out with only 1 of these four places, try them all out when you go just in case you get lucky. We found that seeing them at dusk is not exactly true since our sighting happened between 3-6pm. Have patience and be willing to wake up early and brave the late afternoon heat to seek them out. If you can, invest in good binoculars or a telescopic lens for your camera. But anything is better than nothing. Happy scouting!"

252,Grand_Teton,Jul 2019,not available,"Haslet, TX ",Worthy introduction to area,"Probably many visitors to GTNP are headed to or from Yellowstone, the Grand Old Lady of our national park system. This park is a good way to ease into the experience if you are approaching from the south. Smaller, with fewer, if any, geothermal features, the hiking is fun, views spectacular, and wildlife easy to see. Construction on one of the main roads has slowed traffic this summer, so take the side road past Jenny Lake and enjoy the slower pace while getting a close up view of what this park has to offer. You will pass the learning center, Jenny Lake (get there early to find a parking spot and take an early ferry across), and then meet up with the main road to go by Jackson Lodge (beautiful photo spot off the back deck). If you want to see the historic Mormon Row, you will need to detour to the east just after entering the park."
253,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019,not available, ,Stunning Mountains!,We drove by the Tetons on our way from Yellowstone to Jackson. We took a turn onto Teton Park Road because of a construction sign and I'm so glad we did. The drive on the road is beautiful! It has many turnoffs to stop and view the mountains and Jackson Lake. It didn't add too much time onto our drive and it was worth it. We got some amazing pictures. I would highly recommend taking that road!

259,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019 , Family,"Belle Mead, NJ ",Loved it,We are hikers so loved the hiking here. Fairly difficult level of hiking so you need proper footwear and gear. Avoid Jenny lake area unless you just walk a bit it’s way too crowded. Hidden falls is a nightmare when they drop off boatloads if people at a good clip. All other trails are fine just start them early. Park rangers are the best I’ve seen. Have bear spray you will see bears.
260,Grand_Teton,Aug 2019 , Friends,"Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, ",Beautiful countryside & wildlife,We just came from Yellowstone and this area is so different and beautiful.

Recommend taking the shuttle boat across Jenny Lake to walk Cascade Canyon Trail. Really beautiful views and fun trail to hike. Get to the trail before 8:00 as the parking gets bad. Thankfully, someone told us the night before and they were right. When we finished the trail later (around Noon), the parking lot was completely full! And overflowing!"
262,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Family,"Weiser, ID ",Never knew I could love a place so much,"We had traveled through Wyoming, spending time in Yellowstone for about a week before heading toward the Tetons. I had heard of them, of course, but really didn't know what to expect. How could mountains be so spectacular?    Let me tell you. The first time I came around the corner and saw them in their majesty, my jaw absolutely dropped. I could not understand how I had never been here before that day, and vowed it would never happen again. We were there in October, and I quite honestly can't imagine a more stunningly beautiful time to experience the vibrant colors of the trees paired with the crisp blue of the sky. The weather was perfection, and the crowds were manageable. Granted, some of the areas of the park were closed for the season, but that was ok with me. I knew I'd be back, so I focused on absorbing as much of the beauty around me as I possibly could."

266,Grand_Teton,Jul 2019 , Family,"Klein, TX ","Stunning, breathtaking","Upon the excellent advice of fellow hikers, we paid the round-trip fee to take the ferry across Jenny Lake to the Cascade Canyon Trail (save your energy so you can hike farther into the canyon)...at the end of the day we were glad we did - we had hiked almost 10 miles! The experience along the trail was pleasantly surprising...best part lies beyond Inspiriation Point. Boulder fields, lush shady treed areas, the rushing water that is glacial run-off...the variation keeps you going. What's around the next bend in the trailGo and find your memories!"
267,Grand_Teton,Jul 2019 , Family,"Elyria, OH ",Shadow of Yellowstone,While the Tetons are beautiful and impressive they do not compare to Yellowstone. Spend more time in Yellowstone and see the Tetons on the way south. As far as I could tell there is not entrance fee station when leaving Yellowstone’s south exit to grand Tetons. There is definitely a fee station at the Teton entrance and another one at the south entrance of Yellowstone so make sure you have the right national park pass
268,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Friends,"Salisbury, MD ",Breathtaking,Lots of hours and lots of miles but so worth it. Drove down from Yellowstone for a day. The snow capped peaks seem to rise out of the lakes below. Go to Lake Jenny and take the boat trip.

Guided tours with park rangers are available, which we did and enjoyed. We didn’t use the visitors centers as much as we should have, but they are fantastic sources of info to assist you in using your time wisely. Weather changes throughout the day, and can affect the timing of your activities. Restaurants are available as well as special activities to purchase such as rafting and horseback riding in addition to free hiking. We came prepared for crowds and traffic, but this was not a problem. We had no major delays, only one incident of delay for road work, and it’s fun to have delays due to wildlife sharing the roadways! Visitors are sociable and courteous, wanting to cooperate with one another and happily sharing the scenery!"

This park is absolutely beautiful and certainly warranted our driving slowly(ish) through it. It is difficult to suggest where the best place is to stop and take it all in as there so many incredible views. Our preferred views were over Jackson Lake with the mountains reflecting in the lake, but no doubt others will say somewhere different.

But a friend that had visited recommended that we hit it FIRST. Best advice ever. It would be hard to follow up Yellowstone, which is so alive and varied.    It was breathtaking. The teton peaks were stunning and I was awed by their majesty.  I am so glad we were able to experience it. I would safely say it is a day trip, unless you are an avid outdoorsman. We took a two hour float down the snake river, enjoyed lunch, some turnouts (overlooks) and continued on to Yellowstone where we had the much needed 'several days'.    This is a seperate National Park from YS, so it has it's own entrance fee. Not a problem if you have the annual park pass, but just a heads up if you are using it as a drive thru to YS."

There are so many jaw dropping photo's of the Tetons which I love to see, but none do the place justice. To experience this magnificant place is indescriblalbe. The Tetons speaks to my soul and the mountains are calling me back. If you have every heard the John Denver song ""Rocky Mountain High"" you really understand his words after being here. I am already planning on returning. It's absolutely incredible here."
295,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Edgewood, MD ",Beautiful view,"Did not spend lots of time, but drove through park. Beautiful scenery and stop off points throughout drive. Stayed at colter bay-see review."
296,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Family,"Ammon, ID ",Beautiful,The Tetons were so beautiful. There are a couple stopping locations that are perfect for sunset and pictures to be taken. Phenomenal.
297,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples, ,One of the most beautiful National Parks,"I enjoy all this park's landscape, animals and rivers. Though Yellowstone has the unusual and dynamic; the Grand Tetons has the diversity and verity I crave in nature. Only problem I have is they don't let dogs on the trails."
298,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019,not available,"Gilbert, AZ ",Amazing Destination,"We spent a week in the Teton Village exploring the Jackson Hole area and GTNP. We had the best experiences with Tree Top adventure courses, alpine slides,horseback riding hiking, wildlife sightings. Tram ride, etc. The mountains are a spectacular backdrop as they soar from the valley floor."
299,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019,not available,Maryland ,Beautiful and very different from Yellowstone,"This was a calm and peaceful area... generally much flatter with the mountains in the background. My husband swam in two different lakes! Jenny Lake and String Lake. No crowds anywhere. A bear cub was in the area and the rangers were very serious about getting people away from the area. The wildflowers are just about gone! We did not see any animals although we traveled from 11-4 pm and animal sightings are generally best seen early and late in the day. We didn't have much time here... one day plus one evening. Chose to see the Mormon barns and loved that, too! If you are a history buff that will be a great stop@"
300,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Family,"Atlanta, GA, ",Breathtaking Beauty!,"So different than its upper neighbor & much better run! Way less crowded & way better organized. Parts of Yellowstone were not opened but little communication or postings were available to see this. Grand Tetons was fully open, the lodging very well run, the food much better & the sites & parking much more accessible. We will stay at Grand Tetons always now & venture into Yellowstone to visiting but won’t stay or eat there again."
301,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Brooklyn, NY ",The beauty goes without saying. . .,so here's some advice: plan your trip and activities in advance. Don't expect to have good phone or GPS service.
302,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Family,Pennsylvania ,Pretty,"Pretty mountains, nice hikes.    With children you're a little limited - basically we drove around, took photos, and went for a couple short hikes. It was totally worth it though.    Remember you will not have cell service except a few spotty locations, so remember to take maps and guide books, and take bug spray."
303,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Family,"Conway, MA ",Saw a buffalo jump lightly over a fence,I've loved the mountains in former visits. This time we saw plenty of animals as well as terrific views. And snow. In June.

305,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Perry, GA ",Breathtaking!,Just beautiful mountains! Road the tram and the gondalas. It was clean and wonderful weather! Recommend!
306,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Vero Beach, FL ",Beautiful but the road construction!!!!,We were given directions for the back gate from an attendant in a gas station. However this road was rough and in places not paved. We were able to go around the Park in our car and enjoying the sights from the assigned places to park and take photos. It was extremely crowded on a Wednesday but everyone tried to go with the flow. We decided to exit from the main entrance. What a mistake. Road construction had you waiting in traffic for extremely long frustrating periods of time and by the time we got to Jackson we were irritable and frustrated which kind of ruins the peace you felt from the beauty of the Park
307,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Cape Coral, FL ",Stunning!,"When we planned our retirement vacation to see as many national parks as we could, our chief desire was to see Yellowstone and Glacier. We were told to include Grant Teton NP because it is the most stunning and beautiful of all our U.S. National Parks. That is almost an understatement.    These mountains simply rise out of the ground instead of gradually sloping upwards as most mountains do. They are rugged and are one of the few parks in the US that still has glaciers.    Words and pictures cannot describe this park. The only thing I can say is you must go see it to appreciate it."
308,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Family,"Charlotte, NC, ",Worth planning a vacation around,"There's so much to do and see in the Teton area, and there's something for everyone. We traveled with our 3 fairly young kids (7,4, and 1) and everyone had a blast. Everything from riding ATVs to hikes around Jenny Lake, a Jackson Lake cruise, and a ride on the aerial tram...everyone had an absolute blast. I highly recommend coming here and I can't wait to come back."
309,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Amazing,"Absolutely beautiful place. We kayaked in Jackson Lake and hiked the Cascade Canyon trail. Both were stunning and highly recommended. If you are hiking, I highly recommend bear spray. We had quite the encounter on the Cascade Canyon trail with a black bear and we were happy to have ours with us."
310,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019,not available,"Chicago, IL ",BEAUTIFUL,This was one of the most memorable drives I can remember. The mountains were spectacular and sky was so blue with white clouds. Amazing!
311,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Rosemary Beach, FL ",Just go!,"Go here. Now. It is the most beautiful place in America, in my opinion. The mountains are incomparable. Whatever you have to do, go to this place. It will change you."
312,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Spectacular Mountains,"Always awed by the Grand Tetons, never the same view twice, always changing light, angles, clouds. So Beautiful."
313,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,Arizona ,Can't get better than this!,We went in early June when the mountains still had a lot of snow. Our pictures are great. Plan to go back next year.
314,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,"Chipping Norton, UK ",beautiful landscape,"Beautiful, breath-taking views. We stayed at Jackson Lake Lodge and had a coach journey through the park en route to Yellowstone."
315,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,"Williamsburg, VA ",Underrated,"We have just returned from trip starting in Jackson, onto Yellowstone, and then back to Grand Tetons. End of May into first week + of June. We lucked out with weather. 60/70s daytime. 30/40s nighttime. Grand Tetons can’t be surpassed for scenic beauty. Someone mentioned you can see it all from highway. True, but see it from Schumwacker Landing. Sunrise lighting up the range.Magnificent. In a few early, early hours we saw elk, black bear, grizzly, bison, along with assortment of small critters and birds. Another day was a breakfast cruise on Jackson Lake.  If geysers and hot springs are your thing, than Yellowstone will definitely add to your pleasure along with more animals, and scenic spots such as the lower Falls of Yellowstone Grand Canyon. and Tower Falls."
316,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Family,"Minnesota City, MN ",Words and pics cannot truly describe,"Many people that come out this way make the mistake of by-passing the Tetons for Yellowstone and make a huge mistake in doing so. The Tetons are truly a wonderful gift we have in the US and should be on anyone's bucket list to see. While some of the park can be seen from afar or easily accessible, to truly see all the wonders and offerings of this park, you have to be willing to hike a little; take a gravel road somewhere; explore out of your comfort zone. Doing so will reap rewards in beauty and wildlife you cannot find most other places."
317,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Port Orchard, WA ",Scenic Park With Many Options,"Really enjoyed our visit to Grand Teton - so much wonderful scenery, as well as a nice choice of lodges and activities. The Grand Tetons themselves are quite unique, each peak possessing its own personality after a while. The official park lodging choices are within 10 or 20 minutes of each other, so you can partake of their restaurants, facilities, and activities. Enjoyed our stay at Signal Mt. Lodge, which was such a beautiful setting, and took a nice Lake Cruise out of Coulter Bay. We also took a nice float trip down the Snake through Solitude Floats. The cool thing is the town of Jackson and Teton Village are not too far away, so you can enjoy some time in the civilized world without having to take a grueling drive."
318,Grand_Teton,Aug 2018,not available,Virginia ,The most beautiful place I gave seen,"You will be awed by the unbelievable beauty of this National Park. No matter where you go in this park you will not be disappointed. Everywhere the views are fantastic. It is the most relaxing place I have been. Serene. It is nirvana. That's why I have visited 4-5 times. And it's not cheap. And I am fairly frugal. We spent 5 days and I could have spent weeks more and not be bored. And I get bored very easily. Very. If you go to Yellowstone and not take the quick drive here, you are certifiably insane, as far as I am concerned or you haven't heard of it before. Or you have allocated too little time for your visit. Go. Life is too short to miss this place.    Here's a short list of what you should do while here.  Eat brunch at Jenny Lake Lodge. You can eat as much as you want and they still serve you. No buffet. Made just for you. It's good.too. And particularly relaxing. Pick up a paper and leisurely read it while goring yourself."
319,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Sydney, Australia ",Pot luck in a beautiful place.,"Reading many reviews from a week ago saying they saw all sorts of wildlife makes me jealous.  We were there two days and saw one stag. That's it.  Weather was poor, freezing cold with rain and snow at times. Can;t blame the park for that.  It is a beautiful and tranquil place and shouldn't be compared to Yellowstone, because it is different.  If you stay in Jackson Hole to see the park be aware it has to have some of the most expensive accommodation in the USA. We paid $200 for a 2.5 star motel."
320,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,New York ,Loved our stay,Spent couple nights here in Colter Bay cabin and absoutely loved it. Bucolic setting which is beautiful beyond words. We enjoyed a few hikes and a scenic raft trip which departed Jacksin Lodge. Church of the Transfiguration- a small chapel over a hndred years old- was a very moving experience. Saw moose and calf out in front of it. Short ride into Jackson Hole for dinner was fun and spotted lots of wildlife on our return ride at dusk. Having been to most of our large national parks- this one is truly spectacular- have to see it in person. Liked the smaller scale and no crowds in May. Taggart Lake is a nice hike and there was snow but it was very manageable to hike through.
321,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Friends,"Melbourne Beach, FL ",Great Scenery and wild life,"This is a great park for driving and viewing all of the beautiful mountains and lakes. We saw an Elk up clos,e next to the car and buffalo off in the distance. We also saw a coyote cross the road. The park is small enough that you can drive around the whole park, stop and take pictures, etc. all in one day. There were lots of trail heads but it was too cold for us to hike in mid may (snow on the ground)."
322,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Family,ohio ,Beautiful beautiful place,"We visited the park along with our visit at Yellowstone. It is only 1 1/2 hour drive from the south entrance of Yellowstone, but is totally different view from Yellowstone. I would highly recommend the boat ride at Jackson lake, stunning view and lots of fun!"
323,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Grand Junction, CO ",Christian Pond Trail,"Christian Pond Trail is east of Jackson Lodge and connected to Two Ocean and Emma Trails. It is a 3.6 mile trail with elevation of about 260 ft with a couple of somewhat step inclines. The trail starts at the Jackson Lodge service station/corral. They run horse trips on the same trail so you will need to look out for horse dropping long the way. The trail winds thru some pine tree areas but is mainly thru big sage meadows. Along the way you gets some great views of the tetons jutting out along the hills and trees. You of course past the Christian pond which had about 20 ducks on it when we passed as wells as a number of other water areas. We didn't see any significant animals just a few pretty birds, the ducks and geese. If you are out for a not too long hike and don't mind the horse droppings it is a nice option. The parks newspaper had a nice map of this trail that you should take along as a guide."
324,Grand_Teton,Jun 2019 , Friends,"Palm Beach, FL ",Incredible,"Beautiful Grand Teton National Park , we flew in n Delta to Jackson Hole, Wyoming ...girls trip in May 19 ..lots to do , we rented bikes and we went horse back riding , hiking and shopping in Jackson Hole"
325,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",AWESOME!,"Visiting Grand Teton is beyond words. Awesome! There's a lot of driving, hiking, short hikes, and it's all worth it. Do go prepared with water, bear spray and a flashlight in case you're caught after dark. Mormon Row is a photographer's dream. Be sure to take your cameras and take lots of pictures!"
326,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Friends, ,Extreme beauty,"Amazing views everywhere and we had many animal sightings including moose, bison, elk and bald eagles. And that was only the first day! Stunning scenery. We went end of May before the summer rush and it is wonderful to beat the crowds. Fortunately good weather in the 60s mostly!"
327,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples, ,Westward Adventure,One of the most beautiful places on earth. Animals were great. Met a mama Grizzly and her two Cubs. The park rangers were great to answer questions. Loved this place.
328,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,"Hilton Head, SC ",The Tetons are Grand,"A smaller park than Yellowstone but one we thoroughly enjoyed.. the Tetons are awesome and we had a room with the view of these amazing mountains.... we saw many elk, black bear and pronghorn antelope. Staff all knowledgeable. Cute little shops in the inn."
329,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,"London, UK ",This is a six star venue - truly awesome,"With the benefit of a week’s hindsight, this is a wonderful place to visit. Unspoilt and beautiful, I cannot recommend this National Park too strongly."
330,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ",Nice drive,"I will admit, I did not come to the area for the Grand Teton National Park. It was for Yellowstone. But I saw on a map that they basically shared a border and decided that on our way back to the SLC airport we would drive through. If you are not a hiker, there was not much to do. But the views were amazing on the pullover stops to view the mountains. I recommend this be a drive-through experience as there is not much else to do."
331,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Grand Teton in May,"Take advantage of the weather to hike Grand Teton with few others around. Yes, Lake Jenny is still frozen in May! So many great day hikes. If you want to stay away from Jackson, Wilson is a great alternative."
332,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,"Reno, NV, ",Beautiful!,"We visited the park the first weekend of May and entered through the Granite Canyon entrance on the south end of the park. There wasn't much to see until we got to Moose entrance and the Visitor Center. The gate to the Laurance Rockefeller Preserve was closed so that was disappointing. We visited the Craig Thomas Visitor Center and looked around, visited the gift shop and took a few pics before entering the park again at Moose. This is where you can really see the magnitude of the Tetons.    We drove up to Jenny Lake and stopped in to take some pictures - it was beautiful! The lake was still frozen and there were some great photo opportunities.    We proceeded up to the Signal Mountain Summit and took in the views before arriving at the Jackson Lake Dam and observed quite a few people fishing. We took some more pictures hoping to get a good one to make into a print at home.    Overall it was a good experience and we are glad that we stopped in but it was definitely the end of the off season and many things along the way were closed. Our thought is the park is more for avid bikers and aggressive hikers which is not us. Glad we experienced it though and we would totally recommend it for the views!    We also appreciated that the park was not crowded and we were able to go at our own pace and it was beautiful and relaxing."
333,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Florence, OR ",Great Vacation,"We stayed in Jackson Hole a few years ago and planned to see Yellowsone. But we were there in the first part of May so we descovered that the south entrance to Yellowstone was closed. The west gate was open but it was a 4 hour drive so we decided to explore the Gran Tetons instead. We saw a lot of wildlife, including moose, buffalo, prong sheep and assorted birds and squirrels. The drive through the Tetons was really pretty, great for pictures and it wasn't crowded at all. The weather was so nice I put on shorts and a T-shirt. This was probably my favorite vacation we have been on, lots to see and things to do. Next time we would probably wait a few weeks so we could see Yellowstone but our vacation turned out great anyway."
334,Grand_Teton,May 2019 , Couples,"Caldwell, ID ",This review is for April and early May visits only.,"We have been to the Tetons many times before, but this was the first so early in May. We arrived on May 1st, and found that the park was still in winter mode. Although all of the major roads were open, there was still a lot of snow, and while in the park we were hit by blizzard conditions. Needless to say it was very cold and windy. While we could make out some of the peaks through the clouds, the stunning views that we came for were not there. Partly bad luck of course, as each year and day will be different. And, on previous visits a bit later in May, we saw LOTS more wildlife than we saw on this visit. All we saw this time were distant herds of elk, two lone elk closer to the road, and several groups of pelicans on the river. You might get lucky, but this visit, for us, was close to a waste of time. We strongly suggest that you wait until later in May, or until winter conditions have ended. You will be rewarded with spectacular views of the mountains, and with patience and luck, sightings of bear, buffalo, elk, and so much more. It is truly a special place on Earth when the conditions are right. September is our favorite time, and the best time to visit the park."
335,Grand_Teton,Aug 2018,not available,"Orange County, CA ",Take Your Time!,"Just about anytime you travel up to and around the Grand Teton's, the views and scenery are awesome and breathtaking. Plan on spending time making quite a few stops along your journey as around every corner the views are new! Take Your Time and enjoy!"
336,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018,not available,"Pleasanton, CA ",Lots of things to do and see,"We had an excellent time visiting the Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Park. In order to maximize your time and not be driving all over, it is best to go with a tour guide. We used Buffalo Roam and the 4 of us constituted a group and had our own van and driver. He was very knowledgeable about the two parks, which we did in two days (no, do not try to cram the two parks in one day, that would not be a good thing)."
337,Grand_Teton,Apr 2019,not available,"Waikiki, HI ",Autumn Colors a-blazing,"After spending 5 days in Yellowstone we took a short drive to Grand Teton for 4 days in early October 2018. We came with the mindset that the park would be less crowded and the autumn colors would be at their peak and the Park did not disappoint. ""Yellows and reds painted the sleepy brown woods"" and I wondered if we'd ever go home.    Grand Teton is breathtaking. The mountain range is mesmerizing. Grand Teton is not as well travelled as the other big National Parks so you can really get away from it all. Especially during the autumn months. No traffic, no lines, easy to get a table in restaurants and the some of the stores have end of season sales.    We did some hiking and a lot of driving. We did so much hiking in Yellowstone and driving seemed more appealing in Grand Teton.    Definitely take a drive up Signal Mountain. It's an easy drive up a winding mountain road. Once at the top, you'll want to bring a camera and stay a while.    Definitely drive to Jackson Hole for the day and when you do, instead of taking the highway, Be Sure To Take Moose Wilson Road if weather permits. You will thank me I promise!!! It's a beautiful small winding road that cuts through the mountain. During the early October, the road is a-blazed with autumn colors and there's a look out point where you can usually see a family of moose feeding in the evening around 5 pm. But be mindful of the time because you don't want to drive that road at night. We also saw a bear from our car.    Definitely take tram in Jackson to the top of the mountain where there's world class skiing in the winter. There's a little cafe up there with really good waffles and hot cocoa. We cruised around the top of the mountain for a couple of hours them took the tram back down. While there we saw this girl in about her 20""s hiked to the top. She only had water and bear spray. Ah to be young again.    This is an absolute magical place. We loved every second of our visit."
338,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Saint Clairsville, OH ",Mountain Majesty!!,We loved the Grand Tetons!! Every view is simply breathtaking. The view from Mormon Road was one of our favorite spots. A must see!!
339,Grand_Teton,Aug 2018 , Family,"Walnut Creek, CA ",Some of the most impressive mountains you will ever see.,"Impressive peaks rise over seven-thousand feet above the valley floor and your first view of them may just startle you with their height and beauty. The drive to Yellowstone from Jackson hole is breathtaking, and the range is your constant, scenic companion as you make your way north.    We went as a family, but the area is perfect for any kind of traveller, be they a solo, summer road-tripper, a couple on a romantic getaway or a family on vacation."
340,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Reading, UK ",Grand indeed,"Grand Tetons National Park is an incredible place to visit. The mountains dominate the landscape and wherever you go they are with you. The loop road and surrounding area actually feels quite small and easy to visit all of the main sights in a few days if need be.    If you're visiting Yellowstone, you really should add this park to your trip and if you're not, well visit it anyway!"
341,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Ocala, FL, ",Majestic mountain range,"The Grand Teton National Park is just a short drive from Yellowstone National Park, and should definitely be included on your itinerary when you visit the area.

342,Grand_Teton,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Albany, NY ",Smoky Show,We were on a visit to National Parks out West and stopped in Grand Teton National Park. We took a float tour down the Snake River. The float tour was great but our views of the Grand Yetons was partially obscured by smoke from the western wildfires. What a shame! The Tetons are beautiful but would have been more so without the smoke.
343,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family,"London, UK ",Wow lovely views.,Wow lovely views of the mountains and forest of the Grand Teton Nation Park. Great drive from Yellowstone to Jackson Hole Village.
344,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Family,Dallas ,Beautiful,This was our first trip to YNP & GTNP. It’s an extraordinary experience. In my opinion 3 days minimum are needed even though one can easily spend a week or more there.
345,Grand_Teton,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Minneapolis, MN ",Winter in Paradise,"I've been in the park maybe over a hundred times, mostly in the summer hiking, back packing, climbing and mostly fishing. The drive through and around is breath taking with the animals and the mountains. In the winter the accesses are closed except about a mile in to parking lots where you can enjoy the snow and surroundings. We went for about a three hour Nordic ski jaunt which felt as we were under the Grand, in the quiet of the deep snow and bright skies with only moose tracks as our markers."
346,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018,not available,"Glen Saint Mary, FL ",Awesome views of the mountains,This was my second time visiting the GTNP. This was the first time my wife was able to join me. We had a wonderful time and you can’t beat the scenery. I saw more wildlife this time which was a bonus. No traffic jams but some of the more popular spots will get a little crowded.
347,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Family,"United States, ",beautiful snow mountain view,"I think Grand Teton is really a hidden gem, a great treasure in USA, the snowy mountain range there is comparable or even more beautiful than the Glacier national park. And there are several points for you to appreciate this magnificent work of the Mother Nature. We went there in July, can see very little amount of ice on the mountain, so may come in Spring if you want to see more snow/ice on the mountains, with more snow, the mountains will be even more beautiful, and like a paradise view."

After skiing one day here, this got completely reversed! We've been to most national parks including the less visited Denali, this park is truly a gem! No ""I'm bored/tired"" peep from the 12 yr old, which should say everything... We'd love to come back for more days in winter and summer."

Mountain lake swimming in the early morning has a primeval tinge to it - you almost expect to see a heard of mammoths grazing in the distance or hear the lonely roar of a mountain lion...

356,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family,"King of Prussia, PA, ",Grand Teton & Yellowstone NP in early June 2018,"We did this trip back in early June 2018. We had a great time and hopefully we could go back after a few years. I have been reading posts on here to get idea and information while planning the trip. I recently joined the forum so I just want to share the experience. This was our itineraries. We booked everything 1 year in advance.  Took an evening flight to Salt Lake City around 9PM. Got the SUV rental. Drove to Brigham City (1 hour from the airport). Stayed overnight at the Holiday Day Inn Express (recommended- fairly new hotel).  Day 1: Left hotel at 8AM. Drove to Jackson Wyoming via Logan Canyon and Bear Lake. WE stopped at Bear Lake for pics. Unfortunately it was hazy that day so we couldn’t see its famous turquois water .This scenic drive is beautiful and we were glad we did. Got to Jackson around 1PM. We checked in at the Ranch Inn Hotel in downtown Jackson. Then we drove to Teton Village. Took the aerial tram to Mt.Rendezvous (buy tickets online in advance to save some money). We went to an Albertson Supermarket after that to buy snacks and waters. Explored the town.  Day 2: Left the hotel around 8AM. Heading to Grand Teton Visitor Center. OMG! You can see the Teton mountain range from the Visitor Center. It is awe-inspiring. We bought the Annual Pass- The America Beautiful. Got the map then we did the 42 Miles loop. It is just like out of the world and we have only been at the Grand Canyon (South and West entrance last year) before this trip. Stayed overnight at Jackson lake Lodge. You need to spend money to stay at this place at least one night. I could stay at the lobby and stare at the window all day. Dinner at the Mural Room was great. We used the pool (it was heated).  Day 3: Breakfast at the Mural Room again. We did the Buffet option because we don’t plan to do lunch. Heading to Yellowstone via South Entrance. We drove pass West entrance and then we start making stops based on the map to Mammoth Hot Springs. Explored the area. Stayed 1 night at the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel.  Day 4 & 5: Left hotel at 6ish in the morning. Drove pass Dunraven. It was an insane drive. I prayed Hail Mary the whole time. We went to Lamar Valley. Saw so many bison. They crossed the drove and walked pass our car. We checked off every stops on the map. Got to Canyon Lodge. Checked in at Canyon Lodge then had lunch there. We stayed here for 2 nights. After lunch we explored the area: Canyon of Yellowstone, Hayden Valley…. We saw more bison, black bear, elks….  Day 6 & 7: Moved to Old Faithful area. Stayed there for 2 nights. Saw Old Faithful Geyer in action 6 times. Saw Beehive Geyser in action once. Explored Upper, Lower Basin…….We saw a grizzly bear and her cub near our cabin.  Day 8: Left Yellowstone via West Entrance. We took the highway this time. Got back to SLC airport. Took the late evening flight home.  We love this trip so much and would want to come back after we finish the Mighty Five of Utah, Glacier NP, and Yosemite in a few year. I would want to add at least one extra night at Old Faithful. Two nights are not enough for that area. The weather was perfect. It was chilly in the morning and night but the day was comfortable. I am planning Bryce and Zion for April 2019."
357,Grand_Teton,May 2018,not available,"Christiansburg, VA ",Breath taking mountains,"Be sure to take a visit here if you are going to Yellowstone, the mountains are spectacular. Great places to hike."
358,Grand_Teton,Nov 2018 , Couples,"Camillus, NY, ","Bad weather, low hanging clouds and snow hid much of its beauty.","We visited Nov first. There had been a snow storm that closed the roads in Yellowstone, so we were able to see much of Grand Teton National Park. The mountains were hidden behind clouds. We were disappointed, but what can you do. It's a good excuse to come back earlier in the year.  It is still a very special place."
359,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Solo,"Indianapolis, IN ",Better than it's northern neighbor!,"Although it gets a lot less press than its specular northern brother (Yellowstone), Grand Teton NP is the less populated and more beautiful of the two. The mountain views are beyond belief. I was here on a fall day and was privileged to witness one of the first snowfalls in the mountains this year. Visit in October – the colors were at full peak. Lots of quiet beautiful places in this park. Views of mountains and lakes. Wonderful hiking! Be safe! Be sure to carry bear spray."
360,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Florence, KY ",WOW!,"Have seen several other mountain ranges but nothing quite like the Tetons. They were majestic. Great hiking, time on the river, beautiful views at every turn, wild life. What more could you want in a vacation. We had postponed this trip last year but were certainly glad we got to go this year. After Alaska, probably our second favorite vacation."
361,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Raynham, MA ",Breathtaking!,"We had always wanted to visit the Grand Tetons and we finally did in early October. The mountains were so majestic and beautiful. We drove the scenic loop and pulled into all of the overlooks to experience the many different views. The foliage was stunning with the changing colors of the aspen leaves. We saw mule deer and moose. This park is one of the best for scenery, picture taking, and hiking. Weather was great in the 60-70s. Great time of year to visit since there were no crowds!"
362,Grand_Teton,Nov 2018 , Friends,"Asheville, NC ",Beautiful,"Great place to go if you love to hike. Many of the hikes provide great views of the mountains, and lakes in the area."

365,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Santa Ana, CA, ",Great Scenery,"We enjoyed our short visit to Grand Teton and the scenery. Hard to give it 5 stars compared to Yellowstone and Yosemite, but definitely worth visiting. We didn't see any animals this time but saw a moose during our last visit."
366,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Greater Sydney, Australia ",We crossed the Great Divide from Yellowstone to find this great location,"We left Yellowstone at 39 degrees and found things got hotter as we crossed the Great divide with a great drive and beaut views of majestic mountains and lakes, even with a bit of smoke from the fires present, it added a mysterious component in some instances. We stopped at the Lakeside office of the National Park, got some good advice with regards to road closures and an alternative route to Jackson which we followed allowing us to take our time, take even more photos and a highlight we did not gain in Yellowstone, to see a young Bear right besides the roadway climbing a colourful Aspen, not sure if his mum was nearby or approving, but it made our long trip from Australia, complete."
367,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Kansas City, MO, ",Amazing place to visit,Grand Teton is simply stunning. On a fair day you’ll get amazing photos but often the beautiful peaks are shrouded in clouds. There are great views from the lobby area of Jackson Lodge. You may also spot moose in that area or along Moose Wilson Road. This is one of my favorite national parks.
368,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Buffalo, NY ",Scenery is Just Fabulous!,"The Tetons were absolutely gorgeous in late September, especially with the aspens turning a golden yellow in contrast to the magnificent mountain backdrop. We entered the park from the North Entrance after touring Yellowstone for a couple days, and drove the 42 Mile Scenic Loop, then stayed in Jackson Hole for the night. The two parks are very different from each other, and are spectacular each in their own way. We loved Yellowstone for the wildlife and geyser activity, but really enjoyed the spectacular scenery of the Tetons. With the parks so close together, it would be a shame to see one and not the other.    While Yellowstone needs at least 2 to 3 days to experience the park properly, you can easily visit the Teton highlights in a day. We found ourselves stopping at most of the pullouts, and took way too many pictures because every stop gave you a different perspective. While we did see bison and bear here, they were at a distance. And unfortunately we did not see any moose. Lamar Valley in Yellowstone is the place to see wildlife in our opinion. The animals are right near the road in herds. The Tetons are all about scenery, scenery, scenery!    The crowds were definitely less in September, but you will still run into parking issues at Jenny Lake, which is the most popular place in the park. The area was still under construction when we visited, but it doesn’t look like they are increasing the parking areas. That’s too bad, because it is sorely needed. Definitely heed everyone’s advice about getting there early. You’ll probably still have to stalk someone for a parking space like we did! The boat ride over to Hidden Falls was reasonably priced (ask for a senior discount, which is not posted on their sign), and the hike to the falls is relatively easy. There are lots of steps closer to the falls, but you can take your time and go at your own pace. The views of the falls are worth it. Expect the shuttle boat ride round trip, the hike and parking to take at least 2 hours. Also make sure you checkout the Jenny Lake Overlook pullout for some spectacular pics.    Here are the other “Must See’s” in this stunning park:    Schwabacher Landing is said to be one of the most photographed mountain scenes in the country. The reflection of the Tetons in the water, coupled with the yellow aspens in fall is simply breathtaking. There is only one sign on the road for the turnoff, so keep your eyes peeled or you could miss it. Once you turn off the road, be warned, it turns into a bumpy gravel road. Just go slow, and it will be worth it. Drive all the way to where the porta potty’s are, then get out and walk the trail toward the water on the left all the way to the log bench. The whole trail is about a half mile on an easy flat path, where you will see the famous upside down reflection of the mountains in the water. Fabulous!    Oxbow Bend Turnout is another incredibly spectacular spot and an easy pullout off the road. It is just past Jackson Lake Junction. It was foggy the morning we were there, and the mountains were a little difficult to see, but the scenery was still outstanding.    Make sure you take the Signal Mountain Turnoff and drive to the summit. It’s twisting and a little steep, but easily driven by most vehicles. RV’s are supposedly banned, but you still see them! The view at the top is worth it. Once you get to the very small parking lot, there is a short trail that is easily walked for some fantastic views. There is another viewpoint about half way up the mountain that is easily missed. There is a small sign on the left as you are driving up, but we found it since there were other cars stopped there. It is also a very pretty view.    Right after the Signal Mountain Turnoff heading south is the Potholes Turnoff. As you are driving toward this turnoff, you will see the famous postcard view of the Tetons spanning across the road. It’s amazing! No one seems to mention this view, but it is one of our favorites.    There are many other turnoffs to stop at, and every one of them is worth it. And as we said, you can see the highlights in a day, but you’ll want to stay longer! If you like to hike or cycle, this is a lovely area to visit for a few days. We’re glad we visited in late September. The rewards were awesome; smaller crowds and fabulous fall scenery."
369,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Cape Town, South Africa ",Spectacular,"This national park is absolutely magnificent with scenic stops throughout the park. Favourites include Snake River Overlook, Oxbow Bend Turnout, Schwabacher Landing, North Jenny Lake and Signal Mountain Road.    Keep an eye out for wildlife such as moose, racoons, elk, fox and bears :)"
370,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Washington DC, DC ",Fabulous!,"We entered the Park from Yellowstone's South Entrance and stayed two nights at the wonderful Jackson Lake Lodge. In addition to the spectacular granite peaks, which rise unbidden from the plain, we visited the excellent Craig Thomas Discovery & Visitor Center, which offers great insight into local natural history. Gathered around a relief map, a knowledgeable ranger explained in which ecosystems we might see various animals. While we ultimately hoped to see moose and beaver, unfortunately, it wasn't to be. Despite that, we greatly enjoyed our visit to the Park."
371,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,Missouri ,Beautiful in the fall,We loved visiting Grant Teton at the end of Sept/first few days of October. The colors were beautiful. Great park to hike or cycle. Lots of animals and views around every turn.
372,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Couples, ,OMG...,"I can’t even put into words how amazingly beautiful the Tetons are. This park is a must do if in Jackson!

It’s one of my favorites!"

It was really a magical experience.  Bucketlist worthy for sure!"

The Tetons were a bit hazy due to forest fires in the area, but not near as bad as last September. It was still a beautiful place to visit."

380,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Family,"Greenville, SC ",Wonderful,Around every bend and corner is another spectacular view of the Tetons. It was truly breathtaking. Don't miss this.
381,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",It's much more than the Three Tetons,"My first vision of Grand Teton National Park was seeing a large moose grazing a few hundred feet from our window in the Jackson Lake Lodge. Beyond the moose was Jackson Lake and the Teton Range, highlighted by the Three Tetons, the signature attraction in the 310,000-acre park that was established in 1929. Yes, the sight of Grand Teton (13,775 feet), Middle Teton, South Teton, Mount Owen (the second highest peak in the Teton Range, 850 feet lower than Grand Teton) and Mount Moran is spectacular and awe-inspiring and picturesque. But there is so much more to Grand Teton National Park. It includes the major peaks of the 40-mile-long Teton Range as well as most of the northern sections of the valley known as Jackson Hole. The valley is 55 miles long and 6 to 13 miles wide on the east side of the Teton Range. Located 10 miles south of Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming, Grand Teton National Park is named for the tallest mountain in the Teton Range. The park has numerous lakes, including the 15-mile-long Jackson Lake, more than 1,000 drive-in campsites, over 200 miles of hiking trails, more than 1,000 species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, more than a dozen fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians. It is noted for trout fishing, especially the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout. It also is a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking, fishing and other forms of recreation. An average of 4,000 climbers per year make an attempt to summit Grant Teton. It is an almost pristine ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that has existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. Some rocks in the park have been dated at nearly 2.7 billion years. In the winter of 1807-08, a fur trapper and mountain man named John Colter, who had left Lewis & Clark's Corps of Discovery on its epic journey to the Pacific Ocean, passed through Jackson Hole and was the first Caucasian to see the Teton Range, the youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains. Grant Teton and its neighbors began forming between 6 and 9 million years ago. The Teton Range, the Jackson Hole valley and the town of Jackson are a vacation in themselves, a beautiful and relaxing contrast to the bustling activity and crowds of tourists that dominate more celebrated Yellowstone National Park."

383,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Solo,"Fleet, UK ",Unbelievable park,One of the best national parks I have visited. Lucky enough to visit on a nice day so the scenery has to be seen to be believed.
384,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Pitman, NJ ",Mountains that Reach the Sky,"Amazing beauty everywhere you look, the mountains and glaciers are overwhelming. We are from the East coast, when planning our trip I only figured a day will be enough, wish I stayed a couple extra days. It is a more enjoyable hike verses Yellowstone, not as crowded (at least not when we were there in September), lower elevation and the sheer beauty of the mountain ranges. Hopefully we will be back this way again, I will plan on at least 3 days here. Plenty of wild life, buffalo, elk, pronghorn sheep. Plan on spending a couple days here if you enjoy hiking/walking."
385,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"St Helens, UK ",We preferred this Park to Yellowstone for walking,"A lovely National Park with fabulous looking mountains & lakes. A lot pf people only spend a couple of days here but if you are walkers I;d recommend longer. We spent 4.5 days here doing short walks and driving the loop road circuit. The Park is a thousand feet lower than Yellowstone so it makes sense to visit here first from that point of view if you are doing any physical activity. It is also good for wild life. We saw a female black bear and her cub climb a tree, mule deer, osprey, elk, buffalo & pronghorn by just coming across them as we drove ."
386,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Port Orchard, WA ",Amazing Park!,"We spend a few days driving through and hiking around the park, so many animals to see, you will be very happy!

390,Grand_Teton,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Don’t Miss the Chapel & Cunningham Cabin,"We seek out the less visited places. If you do too, be sure to find the Chapel of Transfiguration in Grand Teton National Park. This lovely little chapel has a window framing the Tetons and boasts two presidents who have attended services there.  Also, stop at Cunningham Cabin for a look back in time to the early ranching life. Take a self guided tour using the brochure obtained at the site. Leave a donation if you keep it or return it for recycling."
391,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Family,"Boston, MA ",Views and views and more views,"What a scenic drive!  We were on a family trip, and decided to do a relatively easy hike. The location we picked was a bit popular and with only 50 parking spaces, we had to wait - but no complaints here, since the view was stunning, and it was nice to take a break and just enjoy being in nature.  Our hike was simple, and we made sure to have bear spray with us (suggested by everyone!) - and the sights, sounds and smells were a welcome change from city life.  We took our time, stopped for water, explored overlooks, had a granola bar which we shared pieces with a chipmunk when we paused to eat.    We went back in a second time, with a wildlife guide, set up by the Four Seasons where we were staying.  Our Guide brought us in at 3:30p and took us to areas we would have never found or known about on our own, from a map or talking to anyone else.  We saw plenty of wildlife, and also chatted with others who had scopes set up looking at wildlife they had found.  Most people with scopes, are very willing to let you have a peek!    We saw various deer, bison, moose, elk - all were incredible, and all were in different locations around the park.    We also drove through GTNP to get to Yellowstone, which was another wonderful scenic drive to and from Yellowstone.  On the way there the leaves were just starting to turn, on the way back, brilliant yellows had captured the hillsides!"
392,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018,not available,Wallace ,Extension of Yellowstone,The Grand Teton National Park is an extension of Yellowstone. Didn't even have to show pass. It is an extension of the beauty of NorthWest Wyoming. A beautiful drive. Tours are available to take you to see the wildlife.
393,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Shelby, MI ",Beautiful setting and views in spite of smoke from wild fires,"We were in Grand Teton for 4 of 14 days on our trip out west. It is beautiful, with many lovely hikes and opportunities to see moose and eagles. The float trip is worth considering on the Snake River. Hidden Falls is a wonderful hike, although a bit rigorous. The views were obscured as the day unfolded due to,smoke from wild fires, but in the morning it was mostly clear. Truly worth the time to see and experience this beautiful national park. Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center is a very good stop to help you organize your trip."
394,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Harrisburg, PA ",Absolutely stunning!,This was our favorite part of our trip to several national parks in the west. The Tetons are absolutely stunning and you can get beautiful pictures from various locations.

395,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Garner, NC ",Amazing mountains,The mountains here are in sharp contrast to what we see in the East. They are very vertical. Numerous stops along the way to take photographs.
396,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,Fort Atkinson ,"Drop dead gorgeous, but a few caveats.","First off, I don't want anyone saying that I missed the point of a national park. Let it be said that Grand Teton is second only to Glacier in natural, awe-inspiring beauty. But ... a couple of ""heads up"" notes for those planning to travel to Grand Teton for the first time. One, wifi or internet access is extremely limited. Yes, I agree that you travel to the park for the natural setting and solitude. But admit it, we all have family to stay in touch with, careers that don't stop, projects that are ongoing. You will have to scout out access and maximize your productivity when available. And don't think that your cell (carrier dependent) will bail you out. Cell coverage isn't universal. Your best bet is to ask employees where they connect, and then go to that location. Finally, if you are a passport stamp collector be aware that Grand Teton has a bunch of different stamps at various locations. See all the visitor centers (warning, some only open seasonally, all close at 5:00). Not crucial obviously, but for those that keep track of such things. Besides, these are also the best places to learn about the park, get trail advice, find out about wildlife sightings, get an updated weather report, know where to get supplies and frequently enjoy displays and exhibits."
397,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Beautiful rustic National Park property on Jackson Lake,"This is a beautiful base for a visit to grand Teton National Park. The mountain and lake are spectacular and this property gives wonderful views of both. The lakeside accommodations are spacious and offer comfortable beds, a nice sitting room and an excellent kitchenette. The view from these accommodations is wonderful; we watched the sun set each evening from our balcony before heading to the restaurant building for an excellent meal and more views of this exceptional mountain range. The food in both the formal and informal dining rooms was freshly prepared with good ingredients by a talented chef. We also highly recommend Signal Mountain Lodge’s Snake River float trip, led by a guide who was experienced and knowledgeable about this area. In September we recommend the afternoon trip, as the temperature when we started was 25 degrees warmer than it would have been in the morning."
398,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"West Chester, PA ",Amazing park,Whereever you go the views are fabulous. So many hikes and opportunities to kayak and canoe. Must take your camera and consider a Snake River float trip which is fun.

400,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Solo, ,Incredible mountain experience,"Although the park is smaller than its neighbor to the north (Yellowstone), it really should be on your must see list. The smaller size means that you can visit different areas of the park more easily. A short drive from one location quickly changes your views and experience. From the majestic Grand Teton mountains, to the Snake River, to the plains of Antelope Flats. You can see a great deal with a limited trip. But if you have a few days, there is so much more to explore."
401,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018,not available, ,breath taking views,"I read books about the Teton mountains and knew they were awesome, but until you see in person, just unbelievable how impression and beautiful, be sure to visit Jenny Lake and do boat ride. Certainly highlight of our visit"

The outdoor deck had great views of the entire Teton range and Jackson Lake. The food was excellent and they had a great craft beer list.

However, There is no other place that I can think of that is in such a smallish are with so much to do and see and enjoy. I love to camp there ans see the wild animals and go down Snake River on a RIB and then get cleaned up and go into Jackson Hole for a great meal and entertainment of our choice. Good shopping too! Where else can you find a greeting arch of elk horns on this earth. Nice park. Just be yourself and do as you wish and enjoy what has been preserved for you!"

It is beautiful - mountains and lakes everywhere. We went on a hike guided by a Park Ranger (a definite to-do on any National Park visit); the young woman Ranger was very friendly and knowledgable about the Park and its plants and animals. Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake are both special areas. The visitor centers are worth a stop to see exhibits and short films. I hop to return!

It is amazing. Explore everywhere. There is SO much that the Grand Tetons offer. There is a very good app called Gypsy Guide Grand Teton that is worth downloading. As you travel, the guide gives you an education on the area as well as tips on where to stop. We thoroughly enjoyed that app."

Took a float trip one day down the Snake R and a long afternoon hike along String/Leigh/Bearpaw lakes. The scenery everywhere is over the top exhilarating. Warm days, chilly nights, clear air and 15% humidity was the tonic we needed after 4-5 months of constant rainy weather in Virginia this summer!"

Since it is the main attraction of the park, make sure you have a clear blue sky before you head out. When we visited, we had low hanging clouds obstructing the view of the mountains in the morning. It wasn't until afternoon before the clouds were completely lifted. However, the clouds returned by 4."
413,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Only ok to us.,"Due to reviews, planned to spend a day. Driving from Victor, did the scenic loop.

I would suggest that you familiarize yourself with the map of the park before you go just so you know what you want to see and where things generally are. Another suggestion is to use the Gypsy Guide app. I read about it on TA and purchased it. It tells you information about things coming up along your path and it does not matter where you start. It will tell you if something coming up is a MUST SEE or if you can skip it if you do not have the time. That was a very helpful tool on our trip and allowed us to make good use of the short time we had there. Grand Tetons National Park is absolutely beautiful!"
417,Grand_Teton,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Westford, MA ",Amazing Wildlife...,"The Tetons are spectacular, but the wildlife is amazing! Bring your binoculars and venture out just before dusk. Find a safe place to pull off the roadway at the base of the mountains and wait. Elk, antelope and moose will emerge."

Also went by the episcopal church in Jackson and both are wonderful facilities which I am sure can use all the help they can get from tourist to maintain the facilities."

436,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,Scotland ,"Don't Just Admire the Mountains From a Distance, Get in There!","For some reason, a lot of people seem to miss out Grand Teton and drive straight past. Those who do are missing a lot. There are many trails of varying length and difficulty but you don’t need to be super fit to find some that are easily accessible and well worth a hike lasting from a couple of hours to half a day or more.    One of the best is the trail round Jenny Lake. If you want to run round, and there are those that do, it may be only a couple of hours but if you want to take in the magnificent mountain views and the beautiful scenery around you then allow a half day or more. One of the most common starting points is from the Visitor Centre/Ranger Station at South Jenny Lake and then head North to the head of the lake then South along the other side. For those who feel that the walking is getting too much, there is a ferry that takes you from the West bank to the Visitor Centre cutting off part of the trail. The trail leaves Jenny Lake shore at the North end and takes you up river to a bridge going over to the West bank. For only a little more walking, you come to String Lake where local people come for the day out to swim and canoe. There are lots of places where it is really pleasant to just sit for a while and possibly have a picnic meal.    Take note of the information about bears and follow it. On our trip round the lake we saw three bears at fairly close quarters with the nearest being about 20 feet. A bit of a surprise for us as it had been hidden by the undergrowth but not for the bear as, following the advice, we were making enough noise for him (or her) to hear us before we surprised it. The bear was peacefully munching through a patch of berries, had a look at us then carried on munching despite a man (not in our party) seeing the bear and running off screaming “Bear, bear, run, run for your lives!”. Not exactly the best thing to do.    Construction work at the Jenny Lake Centre visitor had limited the Visitor Centre facilities, although there were lots of Porta-Potties, and parking is significantly restricted. The first day we were there it was thunder, lightning and pouring rain but it was still difficult to find a parking space. On the second day, cars were parked all along the Visitor Centre Access Road and out onto the sides of the highway. Don’t let that put you off, just get there early! As usual in a NP, the Rangers were excellent in their knowledge and we had a lengthy and interesting conversation with a patrolling group of 3 on the differences between US and Scottish National Parks. Well worth the pause in our hike.    We hadn’t realised quite how much there is to see at Grand Teton and it is now on our list of repeat visits."
437,Grand_Teton,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Alserio, Italy ",Wonderful!,"One of the best place I ever been! Landscape are awesome, looks like Alps but the wildlife you can see and meet is incredible!

445,Grand_Teton,Aug 2018,not available,"Dubuque, IA ",Visit the Chapel of the Transfiguration,"One of the wonderful places to visit at Grand Teton National Park is the Chapel of the Transfiguration. Constructed by a California couple faced with a long trip to Sunday service when they were in the area, this small church has a large window facing the mountain range and log walls adding a rustic look. This should be a ""must"" place to visit."

However, we were simply wanting to travel to Yellowstone via the South Entrance. However, in order to accomplish this you MUST travel through Grand Tetons NP - AND YOU HAVE TO PAY AT $35 per vehicle ENTRANCE FEE - ALONG WITH AN ADDITIONAL $35 ENTRANCE FEE TO ENTER YELLOWSTONE. A total of $70 just to enter the NP that we originally intended to visit. QUITE A NICE SCAM Grant Teton's has going here. This is completely wrong on so many levels."

We went to a great buffet. It was a western saloon/ Restaurant. I looked at a lot of bus companies that were cheaper and cost more but I am soooooo glad we picked this company. Wes was great to everyone. They gave us water and candy before and after we eat. I will vacation again and will go to this company!!!!"
462,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018,not available,"Muskegon, MI ",Beautiful Tetons,The Tetons are amazing. It's worth the drive south from Yellowstone to visit them.

The 2nd & 3rd highest are right next to it, you can't miss it once in the park. There is a pulloff for the best view. The Teton glacier is on the northside of the peak and can be seen from the viewpoint."
466,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Ocean City, MD ",Enjoyable Views at every stop,the obvious highlight is the rugged mountain range that makes up the Grand Tetons  It's visible from just about everywhere and no view is really better than any other. We entered the park from the east ( which Is what we'd do again ). We could see the mountains for hours as we approached and then up close once in the park    Being a national park there is an admission. You can avoid it by staying on the public roads that skirt the eastern boarder but if you've come this far trying to save a few dollars isn't worth the effort.

The park is easy to drive and has lots of routes off the major roads to see even more wildlife and scenery. There are many hikes, climbing, fishing, and rafting.

476,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Family,Mid-Michigan ,Very nice park.,Most folks go here as an afterthought to Yellowstone. But this park has better hiking opportunities in my opinion. Not as crazy crowded. Hit the general store for ice cream and provisions.
477,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"East Peoria, IL ",An amazing view,"This national park has breathtaking views from all viewpoints in and around the park. We drove throughout most of the park in one day. Jenny Lake is gorgeous, but it attracted the majority of the park's visitors. The narrow and windy road to the top of Signal Mountain is worth the drive for the view. Mormon Row offered some interesting historical information, and, once again, provided an amazing view of the Tetons. The park is right between Jackson Hole and Yellowstone, and an easy drive to both sites. A wonderful national park for a one day trip or a camping/biking adventure."
478,Grand_Teton,May 2018 , Friends, ,Stunning!,"We went to Montana to see Yellowstone, Glacier and Grand Teton. Among the the three, Grand Teton was the one I wasn’t too excited to see, maybe because I didn’t know what to expect. But OMG, I was blown away by how beautiful it is! The mountains are majestic, the lakes are absolutely gorgeous. We were afraid that the weather might be gloomy during our trip but we were treated to a beautiful blue sky against the white mountains and frozen lakes. We even saw grizzlies!"
479,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Orlando, FL, ",And grand it is☺,"Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming covers about 310,000 acres (480 square miles). The Teton Range of magnificent mountains stretches for 40 miles, and is about 10 miles south of Yellowstone National Park. The Park was extablished in 1929, shortly before the October stock market crash. Surprisingly, even with financial collapse, conservationist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. began purchasing land in Jackson Hole (pioneer speak for Jackson Valley) to be added to the national park. Much of this eventually created Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. The Park is name for Grand Teton, the tallest mountain in the range, abruptly rising 7,000 feet above the valley floor and topping out at 13,775 feet above sea level."

481,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Cedar City, UT ",A Bucket List Item for Sure,"The Grand Tetons are spectacular and in great summer weather, you enjoy the rugged ranges, peaks and the area. While it's a national park and subject to crowds in summer, there's lots of space, places to hike, drive and spent time relaxing. Driving north from Jackson Wyoming, there's numerous miles of paved biking paths. I'd recommend taking a bike and traveling north and stopping to see elk, prong horn sheep and of course, the mountains. I've been the Grand Tetons several times and enjoyed each trip as theirs lots to do."
482,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Friends,washington dc ,"Thank you, Rockefeller family","The north-south parkway through the park is named for John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who visited the area in the 1920's, saw that development was coming, and bought up 32,000 important acres to present to the nation. (Congress didn't want them but finally took them.) They are the core of Grand Teton National Park. Thank you, Rockefellers.    The Teton Range, in some places more than 12,000 feet high, is so dramatic because it is not obscured by foothills. We saw it by float trip on the Snake River, its gentle stretches all but flat and ideal for floating. We saw the Total Solar Eclipse on August 21, 2017 from the parking lot at the Craig Thomas Visitor Center. Despite predictions, we found Grand Teton National Park a lot less crowded than Yellowstone."
483,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Denver, CO ","Grand views, smaller scale","Since we were at Yellowstone we decided to also include Grand Teton Nation Park. Grand Teton is much smaller than Yellowstone and does not have as much diverse scenery, but it is still pretty spectacular.    The Teton mountain range is pretty spectacular especially if you happen to catch the sunrise as the sun paints the mountains with light.    Most of the activity seems to revolve around Jenny Lake. While we were there the visitors center was being re-done so the Park Rangers were set up in a temporary structure. They also had a lot full of porta potties for visitor use.    Two of the most popular hikes are also currently closed. One due to renovations and the other due to the possibility that a large boulder may break off and come crashing down and cause damage and potential injury to visitors. The Park Service is not sure when that trail may reopen. Even with that closure there are still many other good hiking trails to take.    Grand Teton is not as heavily visited as Yellowstone, but since it is smaller it may seem like there are just as many people.    If you are in the area visiting Yellowstone you do need to spend some time at Grand Teton as well. It would be a shame for you to miss it. Even though they are right next to each other they are two totally different experiences."

This section is my personal opinion of when to visit, as I have visited the area numerous times and at different times of the year. Without a doubt, the optimal time to visit is from late May to mid June for a variety of reasons. In the first place, traveling before mid June beats the summer season rush after the kids get out of school. Secondly, snow melt is still underway and you will enjoy snow capped vistas which will not be present in late summer. Thirdly, the snow melt turns the landscape green and lush, particularly in Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons.. In September, brown will be the dominant color. One caveat: don't come too early as some facilities don't open until mid-May"

It is open 24 hours a day during the tourist season. If you love the Tetons, you can be cremated and ashes placed in the ground on the premises.    If you visit the chapel for photos, morning is best. The chapel is popular so be prepared to wait some to get a shot free of people. The inside of the chapel has a picture window that provides a perfect view of the Grand Tetons."

A few miles from the Jackson Airport, from Teton Village and Jackson, Wyoming are the entrances to Grand Teton National Park. We were there in early July as the summer season advanced...your experience will vary during the time of year.    The opportunities abound, from boating to fishing to hiking. We enjoyed two separate hikes: a short one to Taggart Lake and a lone one up the Cascade Canyon trail. In both cases, you are surrounded by grand landscape and the opportunity for wildlife viewing.    If the outdoors are your thing, you can easily spend 3+ days here. Have your insect repellent if you are near standing water. Wear sunscreen as you are at altitude. Watch your fluids if you are hiking for any period of time in the heat. Pack a camera.    Just go."
490,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Friends,"Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, MN ","Amazing, and Too-Often Underrated Nat'l Park","In an effort to hit all national parks, I added Grand Teton to a road trip through Yellowstone and am so glad we did. The park can be done well in a [long] day but is better over two. We stayed in Jackson and drove in both days. Mormon Row at sunrise is stunning, and the walk around Jenny Lake is perfect. The pullouts on the scenic route are all well-placed for the perfect picture and there are plenty of campgrounds, picnic areas, and hikes of all length and difficulty.  Absolutely worth the trip."
491,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Family,"Lebanon, VA ",WOW,"We decided to vacation out west, not knowing quite what to expect with the trip. The best way to describe the Grand Tetons is WOW. What a spectular national park. Great views of incredible mountains, lakes and the surrounding. A memory that will last a lifetime."
492,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Lancaster, CA ",Spectacular!!!,What an amazing place to visit!! We went to Jenny's Lake. It was early but by 9am the parking lot was full. We took the boat across the lake. It's a short but beautiful trip. We planned to hike to upper Inspiration Point but the trail was closed after 1.3 qmiles for construction. The falls at the top were flowing and so beautiful. We hike back down and then up the Cascade trail. We reached the cascade area and was not disappointed. The view was off the charts. Highly recommend insect repellent.
493,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Rudolph, WI ",Beautiful,What a beautiful place. Spent a day in the park. The flowers were blooming. Saw lots of wildlife including a mother grizzly with 2 cubs. Would like to come back here and spend more time taking it all in.
494,Grand_Teton,May 2018 , Solo,"New York City, NY ",Breathtakingly Beautiful!,Amazing park...great hiking and great views. Watch out driving on the roads cos I saw a lot of accidents caused by reckless driving.  I will always be back to the Tetons.
495,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Family,"Jupiter, FL ",Simply Amazing,"The Grand Tetons are breathtaking! We loved the wild flowers, the crystal clear lakes and the Mountain Views! We took the hike to Inspiration Point and really enjoyed it. The boat ride over Jenny Lake was good as well. We stayed at Colter Bay in a cabin and it was really nice. I would highly recommend visiting this beautiful place!"
496,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family,"Fishers, IN ",That view never gets old,"This is such a beautiful area of our country. In hindsight, we would have spent one more additional day in the area. There are so many different views of the Tetons and it never gets old. There is just something majestic about that mountain range. This was our first time here and we are already trying to plan a return trip."
497,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Family,"Brighton, Tennessee ",Moose disappointment,"I know wild animals don’t appear on que but I couldn’t help but be disappointed when I couldn’t even find a good spot to stock some moose. One trail was closed because of a bear, and there was construction at another visitor center where they are said to hang out. We didn’t see any big wildlife actually. So my advice is if they what you are going there for of course go early or later evening, I guess you need to plan to drive the whole park (we didn’t, we came from the south enterance of Yellowstone and didn’t explore much of the southern most of the park). Now if you own a boat than this has got to be a premium spot. The lake looks beautiful and it’s huge, plus Snow cap mountains in the backdrop. It was nice but wish we had planned it better. Side note we drove through part of Yellowstone to get to Grand Teton, stopped at a couple of geysers which were amazing, and best moment ever....saw a young grizzly just chilly by the road!!!!"
498,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Helsinki, Finland ",The Vegas of national parks,"Having visited a reasonable amount of national parks over the years, Grand Teton felt a bit too much like it was not a national park. Too much emphasis is placed on entertainment, from riding powerboats over the lake, rafting, canooing, cycling and all kinds of ""Kellerman"" entertainment. The National Park feeling is thus lost and the emphasis on nature is quite far away. After Yellowstone this unfortunately felt like a cold shower, even though the Tetons are lovely to see"
499,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family, ,100% worth it,"Really just amazing scenery, especially partnered with Yellowstone and into the Black Hills. Such a range of geological viewing!"

503,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Newnan, GA, ",Great place to hike and enjoy the summer weather,"We spent a week in the park and had an excellent time. We did a hike every day. parking seems to be the most notable issue, but if you are patient you will eventually find one. the other option is to get up early and be the first ones there.  There are many options to hike and if you want to ge the most current information ask a ranger in that area.  make sure you are always prepared if hiking - weatherize as well as ""bear-wise"" . we were a group of three and spent a great deal of time talking on the trail. All of the hikes we did had plenty of people on the them, so bears were not a ""major: concern, but we were paying attention.  We were lucky in that we really did not have any rain while there - but we always had our raincoats, water and snacks on each hike.  You do not have to get out and hike if you do not want to. there are plenty of places to get out and enjoy the views as well as look for wildlife. We saw two moose, as well as two grizzly cubs ( two spots), mule deer and elk.  We had a great time in the park and enjoyed it lots! Worth a few days there at least."
504,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Family,Maryland ,Scenic view everywhere,"Best views while driving you will ever see. Almost like driving along the shores in Hawaii, but with mountains. Be sure to visit Jenny Lake, take a Float raft trip on the Snake River, and do the Aerial Tram at Jackson lake. Great trip for kids. Not as much to see as Yellowstone, plan for a full day."
505,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family,"Cincinnati, OH ",Views are unbelievable,Take a hike! You will not regret it al all. We only did a couple of them while we were there but enjoyed them all. Jenny Lake is as picturesque now as it was 20 years ago. The other lake hikes we went on were just as good. I wish I could recall each one we did
506,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Solo,"Scottsdale, AZ ",If short on time at least take the Heron Pond portion of trail leading to Hermitage Point,"Heron Pond Trail is an easy walking path with excellent views of the Tetons. It’s a good, short trail for all ages. Much of the path follows the shoreline and is in the shade. About 40 minutes from the trailhead you’ll come to a spot that opens up to beautiful views of Mt. Moran and its reflection in the water. Trailhead signage (Hermitage Point, Swan Lake and Heron Pond trails) and bathrooms are at the southern end of the Coulter Bay Visitor parking lot, next to the boating docks.  I made a loop combining Swan Lake and Heron Pond trails. It would have been better to simply take the trail to Heron Pond and then continue on the Hermitage Trail. Unless you have extremely powerful binoculars, there’s little to see at Swan Lake other than water lilies and grass, ducks, and a beaver dam in the distance. The Swan Lake Trail travels inland mostly through forest. After an hour when Swan Lake turns slightly downhill and connects with Heron Pond, suddenly you have a Teton mountainscape in front of you. Picture time! On a clear day you’ll have gorgeous photo ops of mountains with water reflections. In mid-morning the lighting can be good for family portraits. Colorful wildflowers were along the path in early June.  If you are hungry after your walk, there is a casual restaurant (The Ranch House) adjacent to the the parking lot that is open most of the day, with basic menu selections, and wine and beer to celebrate your adventures!"
507,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family,"Youngstown, OH ",Three days of mesmerizing views and activities,My first time in Grand Teton National Park and what an incredible experience. I spent one year working out to be able to do the hikes and see as much as possible and it was worth every bit of the effort. Hidden Falls - so wonderful. Recommend to all.
508,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family,"Bowling Green, KY ",Fabulous. Our new favorite.,The Tetons are so majestic and awesome it is hard not to fall in love with this place. We did multiple hikes on both sides of the mountains and were impressed with the views on nearly every hike. Of course the more popular spots are more crowded but even with all the people it is awesome.

We did a river rafting tour and the view of the Tetons is beautiful from Snake a river. Our guide told us that the Mountains were named Tetons because they look like breasts. Hmmmm. Whatever the meaning, you have to check them out."
510,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",My favorite National Park,The Grand Tetons is my absolute favorite National park. I was there for both Yellowstone and Grand Tetons and fell in love with the Tetons. Lake Jenny is one of the best hikes I have ever done.
511,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Couples,Illinois ,Spectacular views,"The mountains are always a sight to see! The drive through the national park is nice but it is busy. Parking at the major sights is always full and people park along the road and where there really isn't a parking space so watch your driving. If there is something that you particularly want to do/see and it is one of the more popular sights, plan on getting there early to get a parking space. But the mountain views are awesome and well worth the effort."
512,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Business, ,Amazing!,Gorgeous! So beautiful it looks like it was painted by an artist. We didn't see any elk but learned they come by the thousands in the fall. We looked hard for moose but didn't spot one of those either. Less wildlife than Yellowstone but much prettier mountains and valleys.
513,Grand_Teton,Jul 2018 , Family,"Blackshear, GA ",Exquisite views!!!!,This park has exquisite views! The mountains are breath-taking! The ride around the park provides plenty of opportunities to stop and take pictures! I am still in awe of the beauty!
514,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Midlothian, VA ",Super Views and Quiet Moments,"I was in awe from the moment that I saw the Grand Tetons! Reportedly, they are the youngest mountain range, but they are no less majestic and mesmerizing.  The little Chapel of the Transfiguration added an unexpected experience which was very spiritual and calming. The view of the mountains from inside past the cross was breathtaking!  Menors Ferry Crossing remnants are nearby and are worth investigating as well."
515,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Solo,"Ivrea, Italy ",Real mountains in a great ecosystem,"The Grand Teton Park is very close to Yellowstone but completely different. Here you have real mountains with rocky peaks and wonderful canyons between them with a typical alpine ecosystem as the base formed by wonderful lakes hills and forest where typical wildlife is around (it remember me the European Alps though bears are really present at Grand Teton). In this park you can go for real alpine hikes and/or back country in the wild and the amount of people is not extreme for full day hikes, while simple hikes are quite crowded in the summer peak season. Lodging in hotel or camping might not be simple in order to find a spot, camping works with a first come first served basis which makes quite impossible to plan a vacation here in the high season."
516,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Branson, MO, ",Love the Tetons!,If you are anywhere close (like visiting Yellowstone) you have to take the time to see the Tetons. It's amazing and the mountains are beautiful. Several stops that will take your breath away. It's worth driving the entire road (don't leave out Signal Mtn Summit Road).

518,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Long Beach, California ",Spectacular Park,"I immensely enjoyed my 3rd visit to this incredible and varied park. My sister and I took advantage of many of the opportunities the park offers. Our drives allowed us to see wildlife including buffalo and antelope. We spotted deer near the Jackson Lake Dam where one also gets great mountain views and reflections. More reflections can be viewed in many of the small lakes, but arrive early for best parking. Wildflowers brightened all our paths in June. We took the Jenny Lake boat and hiked to Hidden Falls. This is not to be missed. The falls and cascades are gorgeous as is the setting. While many trails provide challenging hikes, less strenuous walks for the casual hiker can be found at Taggert Lake and to Heron Pond from Coulter Bay. This is also a good location to rent a kayak or canoe the lake as is Signal Mountain Lodge. For a bit of history, Mormon Row is a great spot and quite photogenic. Several businesses provide float trips on the Snake River. We found the Solitude Float Trip quite excellent. There is so much to do here, such varied scenery to be observed and photographed, and the park is much less crowded than Yellowstone. It can be combined easily with a visit to that near-by park, but will not disappoint as a destination in itself."
519,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Family,"Colleyville, TX ",There are no words to describe,This is the most amazing place on earth. I say that with years of world travel behind me. I always come back. This is heaven on earth.

If you do access the park form the south west back entrance, be warned the roads are in very rough shape!! Use main entrance if possible."
522,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Couples,"New London, NC ",Awesome Beauty,"Grand Tetons National Park offers some of the most scenic landscape in America. The view across the lake of the three snow capped peaks is breath taking. And, a driving tour through the park is likely to reveal wildlife, particularly mule deer and elk.  The lake has a marina and in good weather there are numerous boats plying the water.    We are of an age that makes hiking more than difficult, so we did none on our visit. But for younger folks, there are many miles of great alpine trails, some with ranger led expeditions into the back country.    The park is just south of Yellowstone National Park, and just north of Jackson Hole.  Add both to your visit as time permits."
523,Grand_Teton,May 2018 , Couples,"Uniontown, OH ",No other place do you feel so close to the mountains rising out of the earth!,"This is a national park must-do. The views are gorgeous - there's as much or as little hiking you want to do, with views available on scenic drives or long distance hikes. Wildlife is everywhere and it seems a bit less crowded than Yellowstone."

Ranger Andy was so passionate in sharing his knowledge and expertise on how the Grand Tetons were created. You take the ferry across the lake (fee of $9 each way or $15 round trip) and you can hike back or take the ferry. The hike itself is fairly easy with stops along the way to take pictures and rest while Ranger Andy provides some interesting information. Recommend this hike for families as well. Bring water and bug spray. After you reach the lower inspiration point you are on your own to return back to the starting point. Thank you Ranger Andy for a memorable hike.

Wow. The mountains, the lakes, the river, the vistas. Great hikes; heaven for photographers, animal lovers and birders. The lodging prices are steep and the restaurants are pricey, so it takes some work to make this a budget trip for families. But it's a must see place if you can."
532,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Bakersfield, United States ",Great park!,"A great place even as the little sister of Yellowstone!

Despite the rain we were able to get in a few hikes (Taggart Lake & Lakeshore Trail). We were based at Colter Bay Village so we would have loved to fit in some kayaking but weather and time did not permit it. We stopped in at both Craig Thomas Discovery, and the Colter Bay Visitors Center for ranger led programs and they were all very knowledgeable & helpful! Esp Ranger Bill at Colter Bay.

When you drive up out of Jackson and see those jagged peaks piercing the beautiful cloud filled sky, it almost takes your breath away! It is a must to see.    We love to drive into the park in late afternoon to look for moose. On this trip we found three! On the Moose to Wilson road just before it turns to gravel we found a moose munching twigs just feet from the road. We were dangerously close, but the moose just stood there while cars passed and took pictures. We also saw a moose at the moose pond on the same road just south of Moose Junction.    This park is amazing! Visit the small lakes as well. Beautiful! Go!"

It was cold and snowy even in June.  The mountain is beautiful and there is an option to go para gliding on a balloon if you choose to... many did, so you see these gliders flying around through the sky up there.  Theres a small coffee shop for drinks or snacks up there , or just to get warm.  You can walk around the area if you want to, it was muddy and snowy when we were there , but alas, possible.  It was definitely worth it.  We had lunch in a very lovely spot , I believe it was part of a condo, it was away from the village stores , so we walked up to it , quiet and not touristy like the others."

Went to see the sunrise at Schwabacher Landing (don't stop at the parking, keep walking towards the beaver dam for great photos with reflections).    Visit Schwabacher Landing, Jenny Lake and Oxbow Bend in the morning for incredible reflections if you're into photography! We also went to Mormon Row twice but I preferred the photographs I took just after sunrise... the shed lights up beautifully. Also went to the Chapel of the Transfiguration, which was lovely. Saw bisons along the roads... would go back in a heartbeat... but the World is too big! We fell in love with this area and would recommend staying at least 2 days."

An entirely different experience from underwhelming Yellowstone, GTNP is nothing but gaspingly gorgeous views, pristine lakes, wildlife, actual bears, terrific camping spots, fantastic food, and wonderful hikes, both with and without other people on the trails. I could spend a month here. Take the Jenny Lake boat to Hidden Falls. Eat at Dornan's -- the view from the picnic tables is one of a lifetime. Stay at Signal Mountain Lodge, again, for the views. As to tent camping, stay at Jenny Lake. Take bear spray, and give yourself two days to get into the wilderness overnight and back. Absolutely recommend."

552,Grand_Teton,Jun 2018 , Couples, ,Don't Miss It!,"You might be tempted to skip Grand Teton after a long week in Yellowstone. Don't! Make sure you take the time to do at least one good hike in the Tetons. While Yellowstone is built around a series of natural attractions, the Tetons is built around one massive mountain that can be beautifully viewed from any angle.    The result is a serene and beautiful park that can be driven through, photographed, hiked, boated, biked, or tackled in any way you choose.    I think that Grand Teton is best visited after a trip through Yellowstone. It is a relaxing denouement to the buzzing activity of Yellowstone.    Don't miss it!"

I would recommend planning your trip here no earlier than the last week or so in May, as the road the closest to the mountains is closed during winter months. It's very easy to see when time is tight, as you can make one pass and see them all, but the sheer grandeur is breathtaking. If you can, drive around a bit more and explore... they look great from any angle!"

The third visit, we hit the weather and wildlife jackpot. We finally spotted a single moose, and we had our closest bear sighting of the trip. Still, the park was beautiful in a unique way each time we drove through. The pictures from the slightly cloudy day are actually more dramatic. Shoulder season was a great time to visit, although some places/roads were still closed. Definitely check before you travel!"

563,Grand_Teton,May 2018 , Couples,"Lake Wales, FL ",What a view,The Grand Teton mountains are special and breathtaking. Grand Teton mountain is one of the tallest in the park. There are many viewing points as you drive around and each offers something special. Take the opportunity to see as much as you can.
564,Grand_Teton,May 2018 , Couples,"Maybell, CO ",One Of The Best Parks in the USA,"This was our second visit to Grand Teton and it is just as beautiful as before. Not too crowded which makes all of the difference in the world. Saw buffalo, elk, deer and antelope while we were there."

566,Grand_Teton,May 2018 , Friends,Wilmington ,One of my favorite places!,"Grand Teton National park is magical. The beauty of flying into Jackson Hole will bring tears to your eyes. I have been here twice, once with my husband and most recently with my mother. Both times were equally special. The Tetons are stunning and the nature surrounding is equally as stunning. We saw moose, bear, elk, bison and many small animals as well. The hike around Jenny lake and up to hidden falls is a must while at the park. This is a great place for couples or to take a family vacation."
567,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Solo,"Marianna, FL ",Can't wait to return!,"This is one of my most favorite national parks. The drive in was amazing. Gorgeous views. I got to the park early and at that time it wasn't too crowded but as the day went on, parking lots filled fast. Definitely go early!! The trails were beautiful and at times I felt like I had them all to my self. There's a general store and restaurant in the park. The restrooms out in the park weren't too bad but I always take toilet paper and hand sanitizer with me. I would look into taking the boat around Jenny lake. That's something I wish I had made time for. Overall, amazing park."
568,Grand_Teton,May 2018 , Family,"New Bern, NC, ",Magnificent!,"This is our second visit but this time it was spring instead of summer. Early May is a great time because there are absolutely no crowds or traffic but there are also very few amenities available and only the Visitor Center in Moose was open. We stopped there and saw the movie and exhibits. During our day we saw Bison and Elk. We got dozens of excellent photos because of the beautiful, clear weather. There was still a lot of snow at the higher elevations and ice on the lakes but the temp was a pleasant 65. We are looking forward to a Snake River float trip tomorrow."
569,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Prosper, TX ",I saw a bear and a moose!,"Amazing views, great easy drive. Park rangers were very friendly and answered my millions of questions! check out my pics on instagram @traveltoeat17"
570,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017,not available,"Walland, TN ",Absolutely beautiful!,Can’t wait to go back. There’s so much to see and do in that area you need 4-5 days. A postcard doesn’t do it justice. It’s an awesome place.
571,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family, ,Beautiful views,"Grand Teton was the first time I set eyes on a true mountain range. I come from New England, have never traveled this far west. Even in August there was still snow on the mountains. It was everything I had hoped it would be"
572,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017,not available,"Rutherford, NJ ",Gorgeous National park,"The park is gorgeous. Beautiful hiking trails, plenty of wildlife viewing, excellent options to stay inside the park. Though the food inside the park is pretty crappy, so plan for that!"
573,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Solo,Maine ,One of my favorite parks!,"Grand Tetons is the place to go when you want to hike and enjoy the scenery without a ton of tourists around. I went on several hikes and the trailheads were never too crowded, people were friendly. Everyone was just enjoying how peaceful and beautiful it was there. I took the Jenny Lake boat across the lake to go for a long hike. The line was very long at 9am, but other than that, it’s the perfect place to just get away from it all!"
574,Grand_Teton,Feb 2018 , Friends,"Dallas, TX ","Amazing scenery, even in a blizzard",It was pretty snowy when I visited so I didn't get to see much of the famous mountains. The cross country skiing was great though! The scenery was beautiful and it was a very relaxing experience. Definitely a memorable experience.
575,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Pretoria, South Africa, ",Imposing Peak in a striking Mountain Range,"We drove into the Grand Teton NP on our way south from Yellowstone. It was only a short afternoon drive, but enough to see this impressive range spanning almost 50km from Yellowstone to Jackson, with the Grand Teton Peak rising to over 4000m in the center of the range.  We were very interested to find how they derived their name, being attributed to early 19th-century French-speaking trappers—les trois tétons (the three teats) was later anglicized and shortened to Tetons. It was another in the geology buck list visits as some of the rocks in the park are the oldest found in any U.S. National Park and have been dated at nearly 2.7 billion years.  Jackson Lake fronts the majestic backdrop of the peaks, giving great picture opportunities especially early morning and evening, if you can couple this with a flat calm water surface the pictures are well ……. No words."
576,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Oldbury, UK ",Stunning scenery,"My wife and I spent a day touring the park via the scenic loop where we saw moose, black bears and osprey among some of the most stunning scenery we've seen anywhere. Every angle you look at it from seems to have another amazing, picturesque view. There are plenty of stop-offs to pull over to admire the view and take pictures. I'd also recommend an audio guide app (we used the GyPSy Guides for here and Yellowstone) as they give you so much more insight and history and well as pointing out things you might otherwise miss."
577,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Family, ,Amazing park,Such a majestic range. A beautiful part of America. It's more for visual pleasure than a place you can climb and hike.
578,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Family,"Phoenix, AZ ",WOW,"The park is majestic and lends itself to parking by the side of the road and exploring. BY far, the most awesome thing to do in the fall is to go elk bugling. This is the mating season and the bulls cry out (bugle) to females to announce their presence. This occurs at dusk and goes on through the night. Bring wine, beer and snacks and park on the side of the road ( where you will see other cars doing the same thing) and be ready for a absolutely awesome experience."
579,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Friends,"San Diego, CA ",Most picturesque national park!,"If you're around the area or visiting Yellowstone National Park, you should definitely include Grand Teton in your itinerary. If you are really short on time, 4-6 hours is a good amount of time to check out most of the highlights of this park. Definitely do the 42 mile scenic loop drive. Every turnout is a picturesque view, no kidding. Such a gorgeous park. If you're tent camping, it still gets cold at night in the summer season so make sure you bring warm clothes. Bear spray is also recommended even though we didn't actually see one throughout the 5 days in Yellowstone and Teton. Better be safe than sorry!"
580,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family, ,Simply beautiful,We were staying in West Yellowstone for the week and decided to drive down to the Tetons. Even though it was a bit of a drive it was worth every minute. The mountains are spectacular!    The area also offers horseback riding or a wagon ride. Some of them take you out and cook you dinner chuck wagon style. I would recommend looking into one.
581,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Chicago, IL, ",Iconic mountain,"Grand Teton is the tallest peak in the Teton Range. There are spectacular views of the mountain range from the moment the plane descends into the Jackson Hole Airport. We came to Jackson for Yellowstone but fell in love with Grand Teton instead - fewer tourists, better hiking, and iconic mountain."
582,Grand_Teton,Jan 2018 , Couples,"Miami, FL ",Loved our guided snowshoe hike through the park!,"Not to be missed. We did a snowshoe hike which was one of our favorite/most memorable activities during the trip to Jackson. Our guide was great, very knowledgeable and the hike was manageable with easy-moderate paths. Beautiful and unique way to see the park."
583,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family,"Newark, DE ",Tallest Point,"The Grand Teton is the tallest peak in the park and a really iconic mountain. Words don't describe how scenic this area is. The Grand Teton is so tall and the Idaho side so flat that we could see the Grand Teton all the way from our house near Henry's Lake in Island Park, ID."
584,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Family,"Miami, FL ",The most amazing place!!!,"We have been fortunate to visit several National Parks and Grand Teton is on my top three list.    It offers amazing hiking, great wild life viewing and the most beautiful views.    Since the park is so large is also possible to have quiet hikes and to find some solitude.    Yellowstone is just five miles north and it’s the same entrance fee for both parks.    Grand Teton is just absolutely amazing, even if you just want to drive through it. However, stop, enjoy the view and go for some awesome hikes."
585,Grand_Teton,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Richboro, PA ",Not to be missed!!,Somehow I had not visited this park in previous trips out west. What a mistake - I was overwhelmed by its beauty!!
586,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Fayetteville, AR ",Breathtaking,"This is one of the most beautiful places on the planet! You never get tired of the views. There is great hiking trails, many of which are kid friendly, and lots of wildlife. We were even able to check out an art kit from the ranger station, and take a long hike with the kids, stopping to paint several views. It was just amazing."
587,Grand_Teton,Jan 2018 , Couples,"Peru, IL ",Awesome views,When I first landed at the airport all I could do was look at the Grand Teton mountains. The mountains were mostly hidden by clouds and during the winter this is pretty common. You can drive on both sides of the mountains onwards Jackson hole and then to victor. Our last day the mountains were clearly visible the entire day. It was a very special treat and a great way to end a vacation!
588,Grand_Teton,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Boston, MA ",Nature at its Best,We embarked on a tour of several national parks and Grand Teton was on the list. This is majestic You feel so humble looking a this mountains. It's difficult to describe the sensation you have.  A must see
589,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Family,", ",Grand Tetons National Park - is a Must See !!!,"If you are going to visit Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming, then by all means, be sure to set aside at least a couple days to visit the grandeur of Grand Tetons National Park. Some of the most iconic and breathtakingly beautiful mountains views and vistas you will ever see !!! Just as fantastic and as awesome as all those pictures you see in the books and calendars.    Here are some highlights to put on your Top 10 List (in no specific prioritized order):    1. be sure and do all of the turnouts along the road that loops through the National Park...they are there for a reason, so take the time to check out the fantastic views !!  2. Jackson Lake Lodge...an architectural gem, take a stroll through, have a cup of coffee of a light meal...and the views out the windows are fabulous !!!  3. do a river float down the Snake River...a totally unique experience and perspective...we actually saw moose along the riverbank, and eagles !!!  4. you gotta do some of the hikes, all skill levels are available, but we pretty much stayed to the easy to moderate trails, and had a great time...excellent way to see yet another perspective of the Park...some of the trail names and sites: Paintbrush Canyon Trail, Cascade Canyon Trail, Inspiration Point, Hidden Falls  5. Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake...beautiful lakes you will see them as you drive along the loop road, and you can even take a shuttle boat across Jenny Lake when you want to go hike the Cascade Canyon Trail.    Plan on at least 2 days...but that really is not enough time...really should be 3 days to do the Park justice...heck, you could spend a week there, if you were really big into hiking !!!    Stay down in the town of Jackson...do not confuse this with Jackson Hole (that is just a ski resort development). The town of Jackson is really cool, great restaurants, eclectic shops and galleries...sure it's a bit touristy, but if you go in the off-season, you won't get that.    I would recommend visiting Grand Tetons National Park in the off season...we went in mid September...the crowds were virtually non-existent, really nice...everybody disappears after Labor Day weekend...and the temperatures start to cool off nicely as well.    Grand Tetons is really a super beautiful national park...put it on your list to visit, you will be glad you did !!!"
590,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Friends,Santa Fe ,Spectacular hiking and moose watching,"The hikes are glorious! Amphitheater - medium to hard. We did it on a cold, sleety day, but the sun broke out to give us light that was almost Biblical. Phelps Lake hike by the Lawrence S. Rockefeller institute is about6 1/2 - 7 miles, pretty flat, and not heavily trafficked. Inspiration Point - take side trail past the point for great views and to leave some of the crowds."
591,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Family,"Wyoming, ",Beautiful Anytime of Year,"Now that I have written a review for Grand Teton National Park, I assume this one is about the Grand Teton Peaks. So, whether you are on the Idaho or the Wyoming side, this mountain offers two beautiful sides. The national park is on the Wyoming side and offers a completely different view than the resort Idaho side. I recommend seeing both sides if you get a chance. There are many turn off point to admire these peaks, but to truly sink it in, you need to stay a while and enjoy the many features surround this magnificent place. The best part is, you can enjoy this mountain any time of the year, whether you are on the lakes below, or skiing through its slopes in some of the best powder. Believe me, it does not disappoint!"
592,Grand_Teton,Dec 2017 , Family,Michigan ,Grand teton Loop Drive in the Winter is Awesome,"The Loop is partially closed but is amazing what you get to see in the winter. The driving is pretty easy too but we did rent a 4 wheel drive vehicle. We saw elk herds traveling toward the reserve, about 15 moose, different views of the mountains, bison, wolf and elk horn sheep. The restaurant at the Jenny Lake turn off is open for food, drinks and restrooms"
593,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Mississauga, Canada, ",One of the most Beautiful places on Earth!,"Surprisingly, or maybe due to the fact that it is less famous than Yellowstone, this park seems - if that is possible - even more wonderful. It is not as crowded and smaller, however, the mountains view, the river and lake, offer some of the greatest scenery I have ever seen. The wilderness makes for a pristine natural setting, picturesque landscape. One may feel the desire to never leave. Absolutely stunning!"
594,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Dardenne Prairie, MO, ",Beautiful scenery,"Even though the weather was rainy and overcast, the beauty of the mountains shown thru. We were disappointed that the Jenny lake area was under construction and torn up but it will be nice when done."
595,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017,not available,"Wayne, PA ",We saw ithe park in the snow,"Going to the Tetons in September seemed like the perfect idea. A float down the Snake river was in order! The weather changed our plans as it rained and then snowed! It was the second week of September! We were so disappointed not to share that river trip! Feeling like this vacation was ‘on the ropes’, I went to the visitors center at Colter Bay and met a native artist named DG House! After a wonderful tour of her incredible art, did I mention her famous blue bears? We had a delightful conversation! She said how lucky we were to see the Tetons in the snow! Most visitors to the park never see the park that way! I felt suddenly so fortunate! She was so right! The next day we went on a very cold exhilarating boat ride across Jackson Lake to the foot of the Grand Teton. We were told again how only a small % of visitors to see the mountains this up close and personal! The snow made our visit so memorable. Also the animals are easier to see! Next time we will go in October!"
596,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Healdsburg, CA ",B-E-A utiful!,"Missed this in 2015 because of the fires but made a special trip this year to see this park...and boy was it worth it!    Magnificent, awe-inspiring geology and a beautiful valley that is the perfect compliment to these great mountains."
597,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Springfield, MO ",Mountain Majesty,Unfortunately the tourist season was still going strong. Parking was an issue even in mid September. First stop was the Jenny Lake visitor center. People were parking anywhere and everywhere but we were fortunate in that we found a place. Walked through the visitor center and received appropriate information on the trails. Initially wanted to walk from visitor centers to string lake but changed our minds and decided to walk to Jenny Lake overlook. Path signage did not seem up to the standards of a national park. Several times the map and the signage did not agree but the scenery was terrific.
598,Grand_Teton,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Karlsruhe, Germany ",Nice,"This is a beautiful national park. You probably wonder: why did she only award 3 stars? First, we made the mistake of visiting Yellowstone NP first and then Grand Teton; and compared to Yellowstone, everything else can just loose. Also, we stayed here in October and you can do a lot less here at this time of year than in the summer, that was our second mistake. In addition, my husband is so afraid of encounters with bears that we did not make a major hike, which would have been nice. And, last but not least, we visited Mount Rainier National Park in the summer and the only advantage of the Grand Teton compared to Mount Rainier was that the lakes are really beautiful right in front of the glaciers.  The nearby cowboy town of Jackson is a good place to stay and have a good dinner."
599,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Snellville, GA ",Breath-Taking Mountains,"It was so wonderful to see and experience the Grand Teton Mountains and the Grand Teton National Park. The mountains are just outside of Jackson, Wyoming, and also close to Yellowstone National Park. If you love mountains and glaciers, the Grand Tetons are the mountains to see - they're absolutely stunning!"
600,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Possibly Best Alpine Scenery in US.,"Fabulous views of the Teton mountains from largely flat plain below provides unobstructed and sweeping views upwards of 7,000 vertical feet. These mountains and those next to Salt Lake (Wasatch) are only major ranges in US where there are zero foothills due to nature of the fault lines along the mountains, providing jaw dropping scenery instead of obstructed views. Combine with the wildlife and it makes for fantastic trips. Have traveled every 1-2 years here for 30 years. NEVER tire of it! Town of Jackson also has real western boardwalks to enhance the cowboy feelings. Plenty of activities too (e.g., hike, bike, fish, boat, raft, whitewater raft, tram, etc.). And then there's Yellowstone so close. It used to be quiet, but now folks know. Too many know. Psssst. don't tell anyone."
601,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Krakow, Poland ",so beautiful,"i didnt plan to visit it. It was just on my way to Yellowstone but this park has very very beautiful nature! Lakes, mountains, forest, fresh air, wild animals... fantastic!"
602,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Boone, NC ",Truly fresh,"You know when people say ""that's so fresh""? They are probably referring to Grand Teton. The air out there is stunning, the sight of Grand Teton is breathtaking, and it feels so amazing to just stare at it and take it all in."
603,Grand_Teton,Oct 2017 , Couples,United States ,One of My Favorite Places on Earth,"I love Grand Teton National Park and the surrounding areas. The mountains are breathtaking in every season! The air is fresh, the park is clean (but can be crowded) and the park is loaded with wildlife, but you have to watch closely for it. It's not a zoo! Don't approach the animals that you do see, but enjoy them from a safe distance. If you are lucky you will see, deer, elk, moose, fox, porcupine, black bears, grizzlies,great grey owl as well as many others. Watch closely. They are all out there."
604,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Pua, Thailand, ",Fantastic - Could Smell the Pine Trees,The Thai wife spend half a day here recently. We were on grand road trip and decided spend a total of two days in the Grand Teton and later Yellowstone National Parks. We were happy to pay the entry fee which gave us seven days access to both parks.    We entered from the Jackson end and first stop was the visitor centre. The wife busied herself taking photos outside and I spend some time looking at the information and exhibits. We then drove further into the park. The highlights were taking photos from Jenny Lake Road and later at Jackson Lake dam. It was morning so we had the sun behind us and in both locations got some great shots with the mountains reflected in the water.

Nice, too, that if you prefer no talking, just turn it off! I am not a museum tourist, but this informative GPS app truly made our trip! downloaded app for Yellowstone, also!!!

Beauty unsurpassed.    A few miles down the road is another mountain range. This time, it hovers over a meadow full of trees with leaves dressed in green, gold, yellow, and red. Another Kodak moment.    These are the two pictures of the national park that stick most prominently in my mind.    Although time is of the essence for us, time seemed to stand still at the Grand Tetons. It was a drive-through because we had just spent glorious days imbibing the splendor of the adjacent Yellowstone National Park. We were on our way home."

We had a bit of both, if you get a good day don't waste it - tomorrow might be quite different.  The vistor centres are well worth a visit, they contain a lot of information and the rangers are great.    Having a bit of snow on the mountains showed up the shapes and cragginess of the mountains very well."

626,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Sevenoaks, UK, ",Stunning views,"We visited Grand Teton NP late in August when the roads are much quieter. This is a relatively small park compared to its neighbour (Yellowstone) but equally beautiful. We entered from the South, via Jackson Hole and its a really nice drive following the Snake River. Once in the park, there are plenty of turnouts where you can park and either enjoy the stunning views of the Tetons across Jenny lake, or take any of the hikes which are clearly marked and range from short and easy to quite challenging. There's als a big visitor centre with lots of information and helpful rangers. As you head North you'll go past the reservoir and dam up towards the Rockefeller area and all the way the views are just wonderful."
627,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"North Carolina Mountains, NC ",Yellowstone's lesser known cousin but so much more!!,"We visited Yellowstone National Park several years ago but there was so much to do and see we never made it down to the Tetons. Don't make that mistake. It was not until this year that we took our son's advice to making GTNP our sole destination and we are so glad we did. The amazing thing about the Tetons is the way they seem to spring up from the Jackson Valley floor - you won't find many other mountain ranges that are as dramatic as this. The views alone are worth the visit, but the history of how this area was settled and made into a national park are just as important. Here area a few tips about our stay in GTNP (I've posted many more on the individual sites, places to stay, etc. on TripAdvisor so keep looking if you want more info.) As older camper-hikers we did not attempt any of the long or even medium hikes in this park. But the ones we chose were excellent. Here’s a run down of things you shouldn’t miss in GTNP if you aren’t up to anything strenuous in the backcountry. First of all - the Visitor’s Centers - not only do they orient you with maps and brochures, they also have rangers and volunteers who can answer questions (like do I really need bear spray? - Yes you do!) and great gift shops which benefit the park, unlike the shops at the lodges. But there are also restaurants and gift shops at the Jackson Lake Lodge area and the Signal Mountain Lake Lodge area. If you are looking for groceries you can’t go wrong with the general store at the Coulter Bay area. The GTNP 42-mile loop road is well worth traveling, even if you don’t do the entire loop - there are amazing stops along the way to both view and hike. If you’re interested in swimming, you can do so in any of the park’s lakes, but one of the best places to go is to the boat launch near the Signal Mountain campground. The cobbled beach is long and the water is clear and cold. A fifth activity that is very doable even if you are not physically strong is the one-mile-in and one-mile-out hike along String Lake to the south end of Leigh Lake. Some other stops you might want to make are the Oxbow Bend turnout on the loop road or the Snake River above Jackson Lake Dam. Catholic Mass is celebrated at Chapel of the Sacred Heart near Signal Mountain campground. and Episcopal services are held at the Chapel of the Transfiguration. A drive up Signal Mountain road is twisting and steep (about 6 miles long) and parking is at a premium at the top, but panoramic view can be had from the top parking lot while a short walk from the next-to-the-top parking lot takes you to a view of Mount Moran and the Snake River. The best view of iconic Mount Moran can be seen from the Signal Mountain picnic area, campground and boat launch-beach - you can stop over even if you're not staying in the campground or the lodge."
628,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Vancouver, WA, ",Surprise! It clouded over and rained!,"We've seen gorgeous pictures of this place and our kids have been here and said it's worth seeing, so of course we were looking forward to seeing this final scenic ""hurrah"" on our way home from a huge five week cross-country trip.  As we crossed Wyoming, coming from the Black Hills of South Dakota, it was sunny. In fact it was sunny until we got here. Then it started to rain.  If you know the ""claim to fame"" for this place, then you know it's the scenery. So, trying to see huge mountains through a rainstorm is a bit depressing. But, we thought we would make the best of it since there really was no choice. We even got to see an elk grazing a few yards from the road, along with a bunch of other people. I'm not sure which was more fun, seeing the elk, or watching people trying to get pictures of their kids with an elk in the background.  Ironically, the rain ended when we left Jackson, a tourist town nearby! But we got a few pictures, and there were less people than there would otherwise have been.  The best way to see the park is by taking Teton Park Road. It's not marked well. From Moran, the south entrance, you will skirt the Snake River on your left first. The first main road you see on your left is Teton Park Road. You will know it's the right road because shortly after going on it, you will go over the Jackson Lake Dam, where the Snake River comes out of Jackson Lake. If you need them, there are some primitive rest rooms on the right just past the dam. There is also a large visitors center not much further south near Jenny Lake.  From the north,Teton Park Road is just past Jackson Lake Lodge. It will be on your right."
629,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Los Gatos, CA ",Beautiful Scenic Park,"My wife and I joined two other couples in driving around in Grand Teton National Park and touring the Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake areas on 9/22. This is one of my favorite parks to visit because of the beautiful, breathtaking scenery that you will not find anywhere else in the world. The Tetons are unbelievable, and words like majestic, awe inspiring, and mind blowing do justice when trying to describe the natural beauty of this park. There are beautiful views from most everywhere in the park. The park has very clean restrooms and nice roads. Be sure to visit Jenny and Jackson lakes while in the park. The park's rangers and staff were very friendly and helpful. We highly recommend visiting one of the most scenic places on Earth."

631,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ",Impressive views excellent hikes,The lakes make hiking so attractive. The park is about 30 miles from Jackson Hole and since the roads in September were quiet it's a short day trip if that's what is wanted.

634,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Family,"Pismo Beach, CA ",Absolute Beauty Everywhere!,"We went to this park entering from the south entrance of Yellowstone. We bought a $50 pass that gave us access to both Yellowstone and Grand Tetons, well worth it! The mountains were capped with beautiful snow. The weather is a very crisp 30-40 degrees at the last week of September 2017. The trees are in full Fall color. The river was beautiful, Jackson Lake was gorgeous! We did not see animals as we were there when it was overcast and too cold. I highly suggest the Plains and Panorama loop that last 1.5 hours, but you see a LOT! Pick up a map and follow the loop. Highlight for me was the Chapel of the Transfiguration located at the Jackson end of the loop. Very spiritual and beautiful frame of the Grand Tetons at the pulpit. Ate at Sheffields Restaurant at John D Rockefeller Memorial Parkway at Flagg Ranch. They had the best food we ate our entire week trip. They close at 2:30 for a break before reopening at dinner. There was nothing that was not interesting in the Tetons!  Well worth the drive from West Yellowstone."
635,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Colorado, ",Amazing,I have seen mountains my entire. I have NEVER seen any mountains that can compare to what we saw in Grand Teton National Park!! There was snow on the mountains which emphasized their beauty against the blue sky. Our drive through was very pleasant. Enjoyed our visit to Jenny Lake.    One of our best National Parks.
636,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Chennai (Madras), India ",Majestic mountain ranges with a great view,The mountain ranges looked stunning with a little snow at the top. The guide also gave us the history and nature of it. You must visit Grand Teton at least once
637,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"San Diego, CA ",AMAZING GRAND TITONS & FLOAT BOAT RIDE,"While leaving Yellowstone after 2 days of absolute Beauty and a wonderful stay at the Old Faithful Inn we head south to the Gorgeous Peaks of the Grand Tetons. They extend to about 12,000 feet and are really something to see. Along the way they have different water falls and different beautiful rivers to enjoy seeing. We stopped at a place called Jenny Lake and were able to go on the Float Boats due to having a beautiful day out. The Float Boats are large rafts that hold up to 10 to 12 people. We enter the boat at waters edge and once everyone is in we start heading down the Snake River. Our Tour Guide NATE was Outstanding. He was the only one who paddled the boat and it takes a lot of strength to maneuver a boat of that size with that many people in it, but he did such a terrific job. Along the way he would tell us about the river and point our any birds or animals who happened to appear, there were several and they were beautiful. About 1/2 hour into the trip he gave everyone lunch bags which contained a sandwich (we had to let our Tour Director Barb know the day before our choice of sandwich) it also contained a bag of chips, a cookie an apple and a bottle of water. That turned out to be a very delicious lunch and we couldn't eat it all so we just saved the rest for another time. The ride lasted about 2 hours but didn't seem that long, it went by so fast. A GREAT BIG SHOUTOUT TO A TERRFIC GUIDE, NATE.  If you get a chance to go to Jenny Lake take the Float Boat ride it really is Awesome!!!"
638,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Waukesha, WI ",Grand Teton National Park,"A wonderful park to visit! We came in September, when there were some fall colors showing and the crowd level is less. There is a visitor center, where we had a one hour presentation on the park by a ranger. There are many scenic overlooks and ample wildlife to discover."

642,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Family,SF Bay Area ,Fabulous Park and Scenery,"We spent three days in the park in the Fall. It had snowed so the mountains were spectacular. We got to see moose, bears, and heard the elk. The only thing that we didn't get to do was to take the float trip on the Snake River. I will have to come back when it's a bit warmer for that. I do want to come back!"
643,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Owensboro, KY ",Amazing Park - Download Gypsy App,"So much to do in this park! Highly recommend purchasing the Gypsy App in advance. This app allowed us to know what was coming up along our drive, told us the best places to stop, and provided history information... like a personal tour guide! Also recommend the park ranger wildlife tour each evening. We saw moose and elk on this free tour!"
644,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Florida, ",Spectacular Vistas Driving Hwy 191,"We'd just eaten late lunch in Jackson, WY and were heading north toward the Yellowstone Park south gate entrance. The only thing I knew about Grand Teton National Park was that is showed up as a green area on my road atlas.    Immediately north of Jackson, the snow capped mountain range was visible to the west. We were mesmerized by spectacular jagged peaks, which were intermittently visible for forty miles, as cloud formations drifted over the tops. We stopped at a dozen roadside turnouts to read the park's educational posters about native American history of the area, the wildlife, and the flora that flourishes in higher elevations.    In mid-September we encountered sleet, hail, snow, and gorgeous sunshine all within a matter of an hour. The Moran entrance gate was closed by the time we arrived just after 5:30, so there was no one collecting admission fees. Entry is free after the booths close. We have senior national park passes, so we never pay anyway, but visitors who just want to drive through might like to save the $30 entrance fee."
645,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Philadelphia, PA ",Yet another amazing park to visit!,"On a multi-day, multi-state trip, we had to stop by the Grand Teton National forest. The numbers of hikes, nature to be seen, and outdoor living is just fabulous. As I shared for Yellowstone, buy the pass that allows you to visit both parks. And a pro-tip, bring binoculars if you have them. You never know what amazing animal sighting you'll come across!"

651,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Boston, MA ",Be Dazzled!,"It's hard to believe that the iconic Teton Range is only 40 miles long, but it is such a marvel from every angle that perhaps even a mile more would be overwhelming. Whether viewed from the Snake River or from far eastern Idaho on the ""quiet side,"" they beckon, these natural cathedrals, year-round. The roads, trails, lakes, and waterways are a continuous treat, camping and other recreation sites ample, wildflowers abundant when in season. The land sings with the timeless tracks of the elk, the bear, the Shoshone, the mountain men . . . and women. The wind remembers thousands of years of seasons harsh and lush, impossibly deep snows, dense and lively forests, and shimmering meadows, revised from time-to-time by towering fires. Hollywood came calling in relatively recent times and left with classics like Shane, but you will make your own stories here, in living color, and you will never forget them."

We saw 5 black bears, moose, and elk. On a trail at Colter Bay towards Swan Lake we got great pictures of a great gray owl. The hiking trail was super beautiful. The trail from String Lake to Hidden Falls has an osprey nest. Every time I go here I discover something new. This time it was Mormon row which gives you all the great pictures you see in magazines of old buildings with majestic mountain views. Love this park!!!!!!!!!"
654,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Solo,"Columbus, OH ","Camping in Grand Teton, if you have a disability, this ones for you!","If you have a disability, this review is for you. If you fly by the seat of your pants, this review is for you. First, you fly by folks. If you plan on camping in Grand Teton and want a good spot. Get there early, as in before 11. If not, you'll be hanging out at the big spots. And while they're still gorgeous they might not be up your alley. It's also much less busy. Much. The lines and pockets of frustrated people get much larger after noon. As far as camping here with a disability, it is amazing. I'm a fly by the seat of my pants traveler and ended up at Colter Bay Campground. Not where I wanted, but that was completely my own fault. It however was gorgeous, tons of spots for those of us who run on our own clock and if you have a disability, they have very accessible toilets in the campgrounds themselves and shower facilities next to the general store. Make sure you ask if you'll be in an area with generators. If you want quiet, you don't want the area with generators. The sites are well kept and clean. There are amazing accessible and off road trails in the Grand Teton for everyone. Do your research if you're looking for accessible trails. Jenny Lake Trail is fantastic, but there are tons more. If you're up for something more challenging search out the rangers and their wealth of knowledge about their park. Wouldn't hesitate to come here again and am already planning my trip for next year. Also, if you don't like a smoky national park, come earlier in the year. August and September are historically wildfire prone times of the year for the area."

657,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Hurricane, UT ","Great mountains, lots of wildlife","We spent two days visiting Grand Teton NP on 8/28 and 8/29. Unfortunately, the mountains were obscured by smoke from the western wildfires, great for sunset photos not so great for day time shots.  Things we'd suggest you do (in the most fun order) are:  1. A wild life tour with the Teton Science School  2. hike to Hidden Falls. Take the boat across Jenny Lake (10 min., $15 per person) and it's a 2 mile hike to the falls which are great.  3. drive the Rockefeller highway and stop at the various pullouts . We saw a moose at Willow Flats  4. Stop at all the pull outs off of Route 26/89. We saw moose on two consecutive days at the Blacktail Ponds overlook.  5. stop at the visitor center in Moose, WY  6. visit Colter Bay and the VC there  We drove the Moose-Wilson road and did not think it was worth doing, no moose lots of cars."

We visited without much of a plan; so, we just drove around and stopped at different points to take photos and just to enjoy the view. I highly recommend the Jenny Lake scenic loop. There's an area to park and see the lake; the views were simply amazing.    If you would like to purchase souvenirs, visit a mini museum and/or get more information about the park, do visit their discovery and visitor center."
659,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Frankfort, IL ",Breathtaking!,"Being from the Midwest I wanted my family to experience the Western Mountain Range. I knew that once the Tetons came into view it was well worth the 1400 mile drive. From the oldest to the youngest they were in awe of the beauty of the mountains and the lakes. It is something we will remember our entire lives. Definitely find a way to drive the Jenny Lake Road, well worth the extra time."
660,Grand_Teton,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ","Tetons was good, full of smoke haze","We visited Tetons in the first week of September. Mountain range was awesome, but couldn't see properly, and couldn't get good photos because of haze. Because of some smoke in south Montana whole range was in haze. I recommend visiting this place in mid of spring or mid of fall. By the time little more snow will be there will make it more beautiful. Sunrise time will be best I guess."

It seems like people drive through it just to get to Yellowstone (which was a traffic nightmare).

The only problem we had was there was a smokey haze over all the mountains but the views were still beautiful. There are many places to hike to from short hikes up to 2 miles to longer ones up 8 to 12. Maps of the area is a must. For bike riders this a very user friendly area.

We also visited Menors Ferry and historic district...general store, ferry used to cross Snake River, barn with historic carriage and covered wagon and log cabin. Also at this stop was Chapel of the Transfiguration which is still being used for Sunday services.  Drive up to North Jenny Lake junction to experience the Cathedral Canyon Turnout to be up close to the Tetons.

I have used your information for years and appreciate the time you devote to TA. This is my first ever post! If the feedback if positive, I will continue posting on this trip.    Wednesday-9/6: We flew American from Louisville, Ky to SLC, arriving around 1:00. From previous postings, we knew we needed to not waste anytime if we were to make it to Jackson Lake Lodge before dark. We had carry on luggage only and a quick rental pick up at Enterprise. We only stopped one time, which was in Idaho Falls. We picked up groceries and a cooler at Albertson's, stopped at the liquid store next door, grabbed some fast food and hit the road as soon as we could. The trip from SLC was interesting and there were quite a few areas of construction, but no hold ups along the way. Starting at Victor we were able to use the Just Ahead audio app, which we enjoyed. Just outside of Moose, we had our first widlife sighting. A mother mule deer and her fawn jumped in the road in front of us. We also spotted 2 male mule deer nearby. On the road between Jackson and JLL, we saw a sign that said ""Bison on Road"", and sure enough a large, solitary bull was in the field next to the road. The rest of the trip to JLL passed uneventfully and we arrived at the lodge at 8:00. Sunset was at 7:56 so just in time. We had a lodge cottage with 2 double beds. We were happy with the room and enjoy the setting, including the 2 chairs on the front porch. The wi-if worked great and coffee was provided. We arrived safely and saw our first wildlife, a very successful first day."

Not only is it absolutely beautiful, but it does not have Yellowstone's overcrowding problem - at least to the extent that Yellowstone has it.    Encourage visitors to book far in advance & perhaps enjoy the Parks in the shoulder season. We hope to return, but never ever again in July or August.

He enjoyed Mormon Row (flat and scenic with badger holes), and got LOADS out of the main visitor centre. It had lots of tactile and visual displays to explain the things we couldn't explore.    Beautiful scenery, and we all felt at ease and relaxed whilst in the park."
685,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family, ,Amazing and awe,"This was the last stop of our holiday after Glacier National Park and Yellowstone.  The best for last....almost! The other 3 are so good, but different."
686,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017,not available,"Carlisle, PA ",Spectacular,"If you're reading this, there's probably no reason to tell you how magnificent the Tetons are. From my point of view, I'd give Grand Teton Natl Park at least as much attention as Yellowstone."
687,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Lewes, DE ",My 75th birthday trip,"Absolutely perfect trip, beautiful scenery, great hikes, ride down snake river, horse trail ride, little ones loved extras at Teton Village. We were 10 adults, 2 preteen girls, a 4 and 2 year old. We rented a lovely house, did every activity possible and enjoyed them all."
688,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Saint Louis, MO ",Grand indeed,Driving through the Tetons is sort of surreal. It's just hard to wrap your head around the enormity of the mountains. Great place to hike around. Saw an eagle out on one of the trails.
689,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family,"Waltham, MA ",Marvellous,"One of the most beautiful and peaceful areas on the planet, an absolute must for nature travellers! The views, the hikes, the lakes, the kindness of the people, all are just amazing!"
690,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Madison, WI ",Awesome!,"This park has been on my bucket list for a long time, and finally getting there was even more awesome than I'd imagined! The beauty is indescribable! Plan on taking your time and stopping at lots (if not all) the pull-outs along the drive...each view has its own amazing beauty. I'd love to go back at other times of the year."
691,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Indianapolis, IN ",The Best Kept Secret in Gorgeous National Parks,"Grand Teton National Park is the most beautiful park EVER!!!! I could not get enough of viewing the beautiful scenery here. When you look at the mountains they are different every hour of the day as the sun moves through the skyline and reflects itself on them. We did the Float trip on the Snake River. That is such a peaceful experience. Our boat guide was Bernie and he was the very best indeed!!!!  We also visited the lovely small Episcopal chapel in the park where you can look through the window inside and see the mountains in the distance AND you can go to the outside back window of the chapel to see the beautiful grey/white mountains reflected in the window itself. What a gorgeous park. If you visit the Yellowstone or Jackson, WY area put this park on your list also. You will be glad you did."
692,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Hitchin, UK ",Beautilful Scenery,".Grand Teton National Park was stunning. It was less busy than Yellowstone and felt a bit more relaxed. We stayed at Colter Bay lodge which was a perfect location to explore the park from. I really wanted to see a bear and we spent 2 hours watching a grizzly bear and her two cubs, it was totally amazing!! The scenery was stunning and we loved the Grand Tetons."
693,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Port St. Mary, UK ",Outstanding,I visit the French Alps around 6-8 times per year (on business) and am always in awe of the scenery. The Tetons take this to another level.
694,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",Fabulous National Park!,"We always enjoy visits to the Tetons. The mountains are spectacular with so many activities to enjoy, no matter what season you visit!"
695,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Weston, WI ",Absolutely spectacular!,This is my favorite National Park. If you just want a beautiful drive (for free) you can stay on the federal highway that runs through the park and still get some great views but it is definitely worth the time to take some of the other trails in the park.
696,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Friends,"Royal Palm Beach, FL ",So worth it!,This park is just breathtaking! It was smoky because of fires in Montana but I was able to still get some nice pictures nonetheless. I'm so glad I was able to go & we used the Gypsy Trail app to guide us to all the great spots in the park.
697,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Friends,"San Marcos, CA ",A gorgeous mountain range,I had always wanted to visit the Grand Teton area after seeing beautiful photographs in many calendars over the years. This year I had a chance to do so and I was not disappointed. This is a gorgeously beautiful part of our country and a must visit.
698,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family,"Flower Mound, TX ",Great scenery!!,Grand Teton is small in comparison to Yellowstone but it is beautiful. We definitely recommend the drive.
699,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Green Valley, AZ ",BEAUTIFUL NATIONAL PARK,"This was an ""add on"" to our trip to Yellowstone and we're so glad we went. We stayed in Jackson. We got up early and did the western route through the park to see Jenny Lake and do a few short hikes. Absolutely beautiful views along the way.    We then arrived at Teton Lodge to join a raft trip down the Snake River to see the east side of the Park. We used Grand Teton Lodge Company Tours for that part and they were excellent (see separate review).    Busy, perfect day. If you're planning on visiting Yellowstone, do make time to see Grand Teton National Park. It is so different from Yellowstone but a gem with stunning views.    Before we went, we downloaded Gypsy Guide for both parks. It was a terrific GPS offline guide that made self touring a breeze at both parks.    If you have never been to our glorious national parks, Teton and Yellowstone are two perfect parks to get you started because they are so close together but are so different. Book early if you want to stay in the parks and then just enjoy the natural beauty!"
700,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family,"Staten Island, NY ",It's ok to just drive through the park.,I wished I had known. I regret I booked an overnight stay on our way from YNP to Jackson Hole. If you don't have time to hike then just drive through to enjoy the Tetons mountains. The park doesn't have good accommodations and food is really bad and overpriced in its restaurants. There isn't much to do except hiking or horse back riding. Stay away from Swift Creek Outfitters for horse back riding due to very dangerous trails. So save some money.
701,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Couples, ,Home on the range,"On our spring National Park road trip from Texas to Grand Canyon to Yellowstone, we decided last minute to go through Jackson and up through the Grand Tetons to get to our lodging outside of Yellowstone in Gardiner, Montana. Although we didn't spend too much time in GTNP, opting for the scenic route was well worth it. We got to experience most amazing scene of a herd of bison passing in front of the Tetons on a clear, beautiful spring day. The drama of the Tetons is a really spectacular sight to behold."
702,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Canal Fulton, OH ",Stunning views,"Our family loved her first visit to the Tetons! Hiking was great, taking a kayak out on Jackson lake was fun, and we enjoyed our stay in the camping cabins right in the park!"

704,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017,not available,"Bountiful, UT ",Stunning Mountains and wildlife,"I've been coming to Grand Teton National Park for my whole life.... unfortunately, I haven't been here for about 8 years. This trip was really great, and the mountains, activity and wildlife did not disappoint. Truly stunning scenes.... we hiked from Lupine Meadows to Garnett Canyon and stayed overnight, climbed and then hiked out. We saw bears (young cubs - so momma bear was most likely close by - make sure you bring your Bear Spray along!), deer, elk and all kinds of critters. The weather turned out to be spectacular and everything worked well for 3 days in the park. Even if you are not the hiking/camping/climbing type, I highly recommend getting out into the wooded areas and going on some type of day hike just to experience the beauty of nature there. It truly is beautiful, and the views from higher up are outstanding as well. Make sure you have plenty of water and snacks to keep you going. Also, as crazy as it seems, cell phone reception was pretty decent where we were at, so we were able to keep in touch with all things worldly as well.  Simply a beautiful, relaxing area to visit - but more tourists there then I've ever seen before so plan accordingly!"
705,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Solo,los angeles ,Bike Friendly!,"I recently stopped by on another bike adventure, decided to take the trail system out of Jackson. What a fantastic experience! There are 50 miles of trails to ride between Jackson and the park. So beautiful! Beware, I first went to the entrance station by Teton Village just to find out from the ranger that the first 4 miles of road were not paved, had to backtrack and use the other entrance. Added 28 miles to the ride. Highly recommend this ride to anyone, including children. Great surface, well maintained."
706,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family, ,The Great American West,There is no way that any human being could not be overwhelmed and thrilled by the beauty of this planetary wonder. The National Park is simply spectacular.
707,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Nothing to see here,We went to Yellowstone first. Then visited Grand Teton. Big difference. There is just not much to see here in Grand Teton. Rent a boat to cruise on lake. Only thing I see is lake and mountains and some trees. Maybe I come at the wrong time.

Without a doubt, the sights of the mountains are among the most magnificent we've ever encountered. There's so much more to see and experience that we look forward to returning!"
710,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family, ,One of my favorites and I have been to many NP,"This park is the perfect size. It is much smaller than its neighbor, Yellowstone, but has so much to see and do. We have been to this park before but chose to spend 4 days here as part of our summer road trip. I could easily spend a whole week here but time did not allow this trip. We stayed in both Colter Bay cabins and Jackson Lake Lodge. I preferred the more laid back feeling of the Colter Bay Cabins. There is hiking, water activities, horseback riding, and just relaxing watching the sunrises and sunsets. Gas, food, and lodging are all available within the park. Relax and enjoy!"
711,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Friends,"Warren, OH, USA ",Breathtaking,This was one of my favorite places on our motorcycle trip. It was well worth the long ride through Yellowstone (from the entrance we came in) to get there. It is absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking. I can't wait to go back someday!
712,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Paramus, NJ ",Stunning scenery,"Grand Teton NP is much smaller than its neighbor to the North (Yellowstone) but packs a big punch. At a minimum, drive the loop road and pull off at the numerous vantage points. Signal mountain is a nice diversion off the main road, also don't miss Jenny Lake. The Jenny Lake lodge also makes a good place to stop for lunch during the drive."
713,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family,"Elmer, NJ ",Breathtaking!,"I had seen pictures of the Grand Tetons- but seeing it in person was truly amazing! The lodge offers Windows 60 ft high looking out over the Tetons which also offered a gift shop, bathroom facilities and snack area. Going outside, there is a path to hike, but it's uphill and could be difficult for some people- but if you can, go for it!"
714,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family,"Fort Washington, PA ",Must See,"Grand Teton National Park is one of the smaller National Parks, but it is one of the most amazing. The ride around the park was easy and every view was amazing. Take time to see some of the smaller overlooks. Jenny Lake was so crowded, we did not enjoy our time there, but the small trails were wonderful."
715,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Ambridge, PA ",Grandeur!,"The Tetons are magnificent, majestic, and simply breathtaking. While we were visiting, there were wildfires in Idaho that veiled the Tetons in quite a smoky haze. Which was a bummer but still... fantastic. The wildlife was plentiful and the hikes were great! Loved our stay"
716,Grand_Teton,Aug 2017 , Family,"Barcelona, Spain ",Wonderful,We love hiking and grand Teton has some wonderful hikes to enjoy nature in a very nice landscapes. You shouldn't miss it
717,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"San Francisco, CA, ",Most amazing beauty- so much more majestic than Yellowstone,It pains me to think some people go to Yellowstone without coming here- and it's so close. The Tetons are the most amazing mountains- jagged peaks and they come STRAIGHT out of the plains- no foothills. So gorgeous. This is not a huge National Park but it is amazing. We enjoyed the Jenny Lake boat ride to the hike across the lake. Really amazed by Grand Teton National Park
718,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Beautiful,"We stayed at the campground here which was considerably over-priced for tent camping. The entrance fee was also pricey but allowed for several days and the ability to also enter Yellowstone. The camper service area was like Grand Central as that was the only place there was cell service, which is apparently needed by many on camping trips?  The Tetons were breathtaking and I would highly recommend bringing or renting a raft to go out on the lake, peaceful and beautiful!"
719,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"St. Petersburg, FL ",Great Views But!,Great views but to much construction going on around the places you would want to see. Parking was there you had to hunt for it.
720,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Family,"Olathe, KS ",Unbelievable,"This place is absolutely amazing. Make sure you stop at Jenny Lake and Schwabachers landing. Walk, hike, sightsee. Oh, I can't wait to go back!"
721,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Nashville, TN ",Breathtaking,"My favorite view thus far in our National Park travels. The lakes below the mountains are clear and beautiful. People enjoyed swimming, kayaking, and paddle boarding. The trails were well maintained. It's a smaller park but a visit to the Visitors Center is must. Lake Jenny is a must see and watching the sunset at numerous locations is a must see. We were there for a summer trip. There are some lodges to stay in inside the park but we stayed in Jackson at The Wyoming Inn, it's a beautiful hotel that was priced in the middle because Jackson Hole is expensive so be prepared."
722,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Phoenix, AZ ",A great National Park!!!,"This National Park is a great park for water activities. At Jackson Lake, you can rent boats (kayak, canoe, power, etc) at reasonable rates (there is a 2-hr minimum but you can spend that time on the lake). There was a herd of bison (over 100) at the south side of the park. There are some nice hiking trails."
723,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family, ,Stunning,We have been through the Grand Teton Park several times and the views never get old. We always see something we missed before. Great hiking trails with amazing views.
724,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"New York City, NY, ",Majestic mountains,"My rating would likely be five had I seen the Grand Teton first. I can not help but compare with numerous spectacular sights.    We took pictures of the Grand Teton at almost every viewing pullout. One of those have wildflowers.    Our brief stop at the Marina was fine. Visitors rented kayaks or went for boat rides.    At Jenny Lake, there are not many good choices. Most are cold pre-prepared sandwiches. They do have ramen soup and a microwave but with a wait to use it.    The grounds have construction; hence, my memory of it is not pretty and neat.    We found the shuttle ride to the Hidden Falls. It is a five-minute ride o.w. for $15 r.t. After docking, it was a nice hike with good photo opportunities. There were mountain climbers on two parts of the rocky mountains, which was awesome to look at through binoculars.    Beyond the head of the falls after the 2nd or 3rd wooden bridge along the trail is a steep climb that gives visitors a view of Jenny Lake and the shuttle coming or going.    The wait for the boat did not take long.    From Jenny Lake, we purposely drove south to Moose and drove the loop where there is pullout directly in front of the Grand Teton, a lovely spot to take pictures.    On the way back north, we saw a fourth bison herd that was not as close and not very far from the loop."
725,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Mount Laurel, NJ ",Stunning!!,"I'd just like to add my review and say that GTNP is as stunning and beautiful as any place in the US. Mountains, lakes, hiking, boating, or just absorbing the beauty of this NP. Plan your stops before you start your day. Get to the park EARLY! Take breaks, bring water, and look out for wildlife."
726,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Frankfort, Kentucky ",Very nice especially after Yellowstone,"It was so nice to arrive to this smaller, less packed national park after Yellowstone. Yellowstone was a must see for us, but Grand Tetons delivered the vacation feel we really craved. The roads for cycling are wonderful - even the jumpy ones like Mormon Road - and the lakes!!! Beautiful beaches abound along String and Leigh Lakes with just a short hike. We SUPed on String Lake at sunrise, relaxed on Leigh lake during the day and also biked a few trails. Beautiful scenery no matter where you are in the park.    The bull elk at sunrise!! Oh my, stunning. Get up early and go for a drive (5:30am or so) to see these magnificent creatures.    Proximity to Yellowstone is nice especially if you want to get away from the massive crowds. Jackson is a nice town, a little uppity but nice. Wilson was nice too.    Con: bring big spray or take a bath in it because those suckers are out to get ya!"

728,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Washington DC, DC ","Beautiful scenery, NPS a little less experienced than Yellowstone.","There's no scenery like that of the Grand Tetons and can be a quick or long visit to be included with Yellowstone. Lots of places to picnic if you're there for a quick drive through and lots of variety in camping sites if you're there longer. I found the park staff to not be as sharp or friendly as those in Yellowstone, which I only made note of after such a positive experience with the park staff at Yellowstone. So do your research before you go, and don't depend on them to add a lot of knowledge in addition to what is on their website."
729,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Friends,"Towson, Maryland ",Amazing!,"Group tour of several areas of the park along the park road and visited the chapel, String Lake, and Snake River views and the Wildlife Art Museum. Good informative guide with our group who made it all very enjoyable, but above all is the amazing beauty of the Tetons themselves. Highly recommend this park for all ages."
730,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"San Anselmo, California ",Stunning Beauty,"There are not enough ways to express how amazing this park is and how fortunate we are to have this place protected by our National Park System. From the outstanding vistas, meadows filled with wildflowers, animal life (yes, we did see several bears from a safe distance), waterfalls to geologic marvels. Put this park on your bucket list."
731,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Teton is terrific,Drove through the Teton mountains. Very pretty and peaceful. It was not crowded when we were there. There were plenty of pull offs so you could take great pictures.
732,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"New York City, NY ","Quieter than Yellowstone, soaked in the natural beauty","The mountain of Teton is always with you whenever you drive...  The sharp and snow capped peaks of mountains looked exceptional.  Rest at the restaurant/ lodge was another fun thing.  Animals were sometimes wondering on the field.  Less ""tourists"" but more bikers, kayaker and hikers who really want to immerse the natural beauty.  The atmosphere was less tourism (of course- still) than Yellowstone national park. Less hectic but more nature feel."
733,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"San Jose, CA ","Excellent ""desert"" after Yellowstone","After viewing Yellowstone NP, although yo are physically lower in elevation, the mountains and large wildlife lift you up. Dawn and dusk are your times for the mountains, bear, moose, elk, bison,pronghorn antelope, and foxes."
734,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family, ,Tetons are beautiful!,We loved going to the Tetons and seeing them. Lots of amazing hikes!! We saw lots of birds of prey here which was super neat. Tetons are a wonderful park to visit. We loved it here! It doesn't get too hot in the day.
735,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Couples,"Saint Louis, MO ",5/17/17 Rexburg to Riverton via Jackson Hole and the Grand Tetons.......,"I have made it a practice to review the hotel that was the final destination of each day's journey to begin each portion of this narrative. This entry is an exception due to my beginning this tale with a review of the Paintbrush Hotel due to our pleasant experience with them while Tripadvisor reviews were largely responsible for our choice of the hotel.    This was the first day we had to implement a Plan B (Grand Teton NP) having heretofore faithfully followed the itinerary I had mapped out up to this point although our ultimate destination, Riverton, Wy., remained. We left earlier than usual due to the weather (very cold, windy, snow and sleet, 32 degrees; precip lessened as we headed to Jackson Hole but was off and on most of the day) and the uncertainty of an improvised path.    The road from Rexburg to Jackson Hole (JH) was full of interesting sights including the ruins of an earthen dam on the Teton River in 1976, just a few miles upstream of Rexburg. The collapse of this dam took out about 80% of the town we just left! Wow! Many other interpretative overlooks were visited as we traveled east on Idaho 33, crossed over the mountains (w/ occasional light snow) arriving in JH where we found a Visitors Center which proved quite helpful going into GTNP.    GTNP well worth the visit. Check the web. Not crowded at all with anything but wildlife and magnificent views. Overcast hid the peaks but the mountains are sublime. Met an entire family of Red Sox fans. Once again, cordiality all around. Spent a good 4 hours mostly driving, pulling out/parking, reading signs, short hikes (it was cold) and gazing at the mountains.    Leaving GTNP E to Riverton is a straight shot through the center of the Wind River Reservation. We started E in brief, sometimes heavy snow but soon found sunshine and temps in the 50's. For miles we had the road to ourselves on a scenic drive, towns few and far between. I do not recall the speed limit (65 to 70?) but I believe we made it to Riverton in a ""timely"" manner. This was not the first time the road was almost as enjoyable as our time in the park, nor the last.    Next time: Riverton to Provo with another visit from Mother Nature....""the best laid plans...."""
736,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017,not available,"Estacada, OR ",Day trip with mom,This is my favorite place to visit and I try to get here once a year. Just know the summer months are the most crowded and if you don't like crowds wait until the end of August to visit. I have been in July and August. I prefer August because I don't like the large crowds. Plus I have seen more wildlife in August when driving around. This was a beautiful visit as always. I came early in the morning to beat some of the crowds. Laurence Rockefeller preserve was nice but the center doesn't open until 9. We were too early to go inside. This is also a major trail head location and the parking lot fills by 9 or shortly thereafter. Next stop was the Jenny Lake loop. String Lake parking lot was full and this was around 8 am. You could find parking in the larger lot down the way. We got down to the overlook and there was plenty of parking. Next stop Signal Mountain Lodge. Walked around and took pictures. We decided to go out the Moran exit. Stopped at a few turnouts for pictures. We did see buffalo in the far distance in this area. We saw no other wildlife (bummer). Early morning and evening are the best times to find wildlife but they do show up during the day as well. The mountains are majestic and you can get wonderful pictures any where in the park. My trip next year will include a long camping trip in this park so I can explore any time of day.
737,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Fairfax, VA ",Sunset Tour with Ecotours,"Our guide, Sean, took us on a fun adventure along some of the back roads as well as the main roads. We were up close with bison, and as close as possible to a black bear. Beautiful waterfalls and stunning sunset! This was our second tour with Ecotours. Both guides, Chelsea and Sean, are very well educated and passionate about the environment and wildlife. We highly recommend Ecotours."
738,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples, ,Beautiful park,Beautiful mountains towering over park. Went on a breakfast cruise on Jackson Lake that was phenomenal. Good was delicious.
739,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Hagerstown, MD ",Thanks for perserving this beauty,The most breathtaking views you will see anywhere in the world. There is also tons of trails for hikers of all levels. The lakes and hidden beauty are worth the trek.
740,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Sunnyvale, CA ","Amazing views, mountains, lakes, river, and wildlife","This is a small park compared to its nearby cousin Yellowstone but it is dramatically different to Yellowstone. Blue and warm lakes, Mountain vistas, and opportunity to see wildlife and rafting (just gliding, not white water) in the snake river is something one must consider. Very refreshing place."
741,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Family,The Netherlands ,One of the most beautiful places I've traveled,"I love, love, love mountains. I don't know if it's because of how I feel there because of the elevation and fresh air or just because they're so awe inspiring. Whatever it is, these are some of my favorite mountains in the world. These come in close second to the Alps in Europe for me. I never dreamed I'd be so impressed with these. I haven't been here since I was a child and have spent much more time in other mountain ranges, mostly the Alps, so I was very happily surprised with the Grand Tetons. We flew into Jackson Hole, so seeing them from the air was an incredible beginning. My children and European friends also get a big kick out of the name. We really had a lovely time, saw so many animals, and enjoyed the weather and beautiful views. I can't wait to go back."
742,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Friends, ,Breathtakingly beautiful,"Located between Yellowstone National Park and Jackson Hole WY, they are a spectacular mountain range. There is not as much wildlife and scenery as Yellowstone, but it is worth a visit if you are in the area. Take a float trip or a hike. There is a car trail for those who need to see the sights without walking. Go to Jackson Hole Teton village to catch a gondola ride to the top of a mountain. I highly recommend staying in a lodge. We stayed at Jackson Lake Lodge and although they are 50/ style motel drive-ups, they are totally renovated and comfortable. (Remember there are no TV or refrigerators in national park hotels). They are drive-up and handicap accessible. There are 3 dining options in the main lodge and an awesome outside bar with a view of the mountains. Ask for a patio that does not face a parking lot and enjoy nature."
743,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Wills Point, TX ",Beautiful Place,"You really need several days here. We drove the loop, a beautiful place. Great place to camp, and hike. A must see."
744,Grand_Teton,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Saint Louis, MO ",The Best!,"I have been to GTNP twice, and look forward to going back again. I had been told that I might enjoy it more than Yellowstone. I thought that would be hard to do, but yes, I did enjoy it more. Although in fairness, it's like comparing apples and oranges.  The scenery is magnificent, but everyone knows that. We bought numerous books on hiking beforehand, but I think that was overkill. Save your money because you can find plenty of information at the park.  If possible, go on a ranger led hike or talk. We did a couple of these, and both were incredibly informative. I especially enjoyed the caravan in the the evening looking for wildlife.  The park is very busy and can be crowded. Try to go early in the morning or at dusk if you want less traffic. We drove down a back road late in the day, and were able to see wildlife at a more leisurely pace.  Enjoy your trip!"
745,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Rock Island, IL ",Great View,"Take the tram up to the top and get out look around, hike and take the tram back down. So neat to be 80 outside and walk on snow. The mountains had snow all over them. Beautiful views."
746,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Couples,"San Diego, California ",Beyond Beautiful,"Wow! Stunningly beautiful from every perspective. Despite the normal high season traffic, it is possible to find less traveled roads. There are separate paved bike paths all the way from Jackson to Jenny Lake which were well used."

Get there early and then go south about 5-10 miles or so and you will see a picnic area on your left called ""Cottonwood creek."" On a hot day, our kids swam in the creek just off this picnic area. Beautiful of Grand Teton also. We spent 2 hours here having a great time."
748,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Near and deer,"I almost missed going to GTNP! While planning our YSNP trip, a friend asked if we were going to the Teton's and I said no. I had not been impressed with what I'd read about it. He showed me photos of his family atop Signal Mountain which instantly changed my mind. Being so near at Yellowstone, I'm so glad we went, I have amazing photos and memories.    We took a day trip from Yellowstone to the Tetons. Taking the South Entrance out of Yellowstone brings you into Grand Teton NP. We stopped at the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway visitor center for maps and the rangers were extremely helpful in helping us plan our day. We had hoped to hike up Signal Mountain, but the 3 hour one way hike was too long for our short day trip...so we drove up there!    Bring a picnic lunch and some chairs and have lunch atop Signal Mountain. You will love it. There is a pull off enroute to the top. Stop there and get some great photos and mountain air. We saw animals in the valley below and a bear nearby.    After Signal Mountain, we went to Jenny Lake and hiked to Moose Pond(s). It was a moderate hike that goes off the beaten path. We missed the Moose others reported seeing, but saw a huge buck as we were exiting the trail where it connects to the parking lot. We were literally within 10 feet of this amazing creature as he slowly walked past us, across the path, and into the woods on the other side of the path.    I wish we had more than 1 day to be in the Tetons, they are so amazing to experience!"
749,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Baltimore, MD ",Hidden gem,"The drive thru thru the Tetons and Jenny Lake, while very crowded, is well worth the traffic. The visitors centers are mobbed. Arrive early. And be prepared to be stunned by the sites. At the end of the Tetons is Jackson Hole, treat yourself to the tram ride. It's a bit pricy but it's worth every dime. But if you book online, it saves you some money."
750,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Greenville, North Carolina, United States ",Wow!,Enough said. A trip to the Tetons should be on everyone's bucket list. Much less touristy then Yellowstone.
751,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Family,"Jackson WY, United States ",Best advice from a local-Have a great Teton experience!,"Love mountains? Nothing better than the Tetons. Most visitors limit themselves to driving through & taking a few pictures. There is so much more!    It's very important to research your trip in advance, so you know what exactly to spend your time on depending on what you like to do. Everything can be researched online.    Mountain viewing? The Tetons stretch for almost 100 miles north-south. There are incredible views from every angle, and specific mountains are more prominent at every viewing area. Check out a virtual map in advance so you recognize the peaks.    Hiking? Trail maps available from the FS/NPS. Hikes from 2 hrs to 4 days. If you are coming in winter you can snowshoe some of the shorter hikes close to the southern entrance.    Fishing? You need a WY fishing license, but there is no NP license required.    Swimming? Don't miss the String Lakes.    Lunch/snacks/dinner? Dornan's is loved by locals as well as touristi. Moose often visible there. Less expensive than Jackson Lake Lodge,    Lodging? All lodging in GTNP is limited, including camping of all kinds. You must have reservations, preferably a year in advance. Fanciest--Jackson Lake Lodge, but also more touristy. A very nice lunch visit on the deck. A little less fancy & a bit more rustic, Jenny Lake Lodge, where there are also cabins. Otherwise camp or stay in Jackson.    Floating/Fishing the Snake River? You must have a guided trip for this, unless you are a very experienced whitewater rafter. Even then, year-to-year conditions can make a huge and violent difference. We have already lost 3 people on the Snake this summer, a real tragedy. (We have our own raft and haven't been out this year ourselves because of the conditions.) Please don't tempt fate.    Have a great Teton experience!"

753,Grand_Teton,Jul 2017 , Family,"Charlotte, NC ",Amazing scenary,We loved visiting the Grand Teton National Park. The mountains are just amazing. The park is very clean and easily accessible. My 8 year old really enjoyed the Junior Ranger program and being sworn in as a Junior Ranger.
754,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Solo,"Worcester, UK, ",Better than Yellowstone by Miles,"During my stay near West Yellowstone I was determined to see a Moose in the wild so I set off from my accommodation for a three hour drive through Yellowstone and into Teton to get to the observations points before sunrise.    Seeing the Teton mountains in front of me as I drove out of Yellowstone was one of the most breathtaking sights I have ever seen. Words can't describe the view and I should have stopped to take some pictures. However, I drove on into the park and took some from a longer distance as the sun was rising. The view was still spectacular but not as good as the view from close up.    I eventually drove towards Moose Wilson Road, which is a narrow road off the beaten track. I arrived there about 6.45am and drove the whole length of it hoping for success. I spotted to Elk stags near the far end of the road as it approached the other side of the park towards Teton Village.    I drove into Jackson, filled up the tank and drove back the way I came. Shortly after returning to the park I observed about half a dozen Moose but they were so far off I could only see them through binoculars. However, I persisted and eventually struck lucky as I saw a mother and calf sitting by the river bank. My dreams came true and that truly made my holiday. I stayed sitting on the bank observing them for about an hour before deciding to return to my accommodation.    On the way back I drove past the town of Moose and over the Teton pass, which takes you up a snaking road through the far end of the mountains. This was a lovely drive towards Driggs and well worth the effort. Overall, this was the best day of the holiday for me and I still had another week to go.    In summary, anyone expressing a wish to go to Yellowstone, ought to visit Teton as well. There is wildlife a plant and a better chance of seeing Elk, Moose and Grizzly Bears. It's only $20 for a 7 day pass and exceptional value for money."
755,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017,not available, ,"Breathtaking Views, Relaxed Vacation","We hit Grand Teton before Yellowstone the last week of June, and stayed at the Jackson Lake Lodge. The natural beauty of Grand Teton is stunning, and using the Gypsy app we were able to see all the highlights at a relaxed pace in the day we were there. We did not encounter any crowds, and were able to see wildlife such as moose, grizzy bear and uinta squirrels chattering at us. As mentioned in other reviews, Dornan's is a must to grab sandwiches and supplies, and recommend you bring mosquito repellant such as Sawyer Picaridin when checking out the view at Signal Mountain. Look forward to returning when we can stay a little longer!"

We love nature, the outdoors, hiking, etc. and this is the place to find all sorts of outdoor adventures from easy to extreme! There is something for any nature or outdoor enthusiast. The visitor centers are excellent too. There is just so much packed into a smaller area than many other National Parks. You don't have to drive hours or fight crowds to see the attractions. And the mountains are simply majestic!"

I'm so glad we did. We spent 3 days in this beautiful place. We saw so many animals, drove all the scenic roads we could find and walked over 20 miles of trails in those 3 days. The views were great, the church's were peaceful and inviting to visit. We took in the log homes and Ferry. Marveled at the Bison and prong horn all over the place and spent plenty of time laughing at the prairie dogs. This was time well spent with the kids and then even got along."

We were there in mid June and there was still lots and lots of snow on the mountains. It made for some spectacular scenery. We also saw a black bear, a bull moose and lots of deer. I would recommend this park to anyone who appreciates fantastic scenery."
776,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Makati, Philippines ",Awestruck!!!,"The first time I had a glimpse of the Teton Range was on our way to Yellowstone National Park from Jackson Hole. It is purely amazing to see the mountain range cut into the blue sky, specially for its tallest peak, the Grand Teton. I've seen many mountain ranges and this already beat the Remarkables in Queenstown, NZ as my favorite.    The drive as you enter Grand Teton National Park is I think the best way to marvel at how grand it is. You can basically see the peak wherever you are within the park."

788,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Jersey City, NJ ",The Best,"Loved the Gran Tetons better than Yellowstone. First. they are less crowded. You can find some off-the-beaten-track trails and easy to hike areas. You can drive this park without sitting in traffic. (It took us nearly two hours to leave Yellowstone because of the traffic!) The views are majestic and thrilling and inspiring whereas Yellowstone has fewer vistas (more lake hiking and geyser viewing (which--and I know how this sounds--is like technicolor hot tubs that smell of a burnt match/raw egg and are several rows deep with tourists if you get there when they're about to ""go off""). There were moose, antelopes, deer, prairie dogs and river otters. Saw a few first-year moose in Yellowstone (no other wildlife) by comparison."

796,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Fishkill, NY ",One of the World's Most Beautiful Places,"My wife and I recently visited Grand Teton, Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. In terms of most spectacular views, I have to put Grand Teton at the top of the list. From your very first view of the mountains you will be continually saying ""Wow"" around every corner. The Park offers lots of options, whether you are just driving around, hiking or camping. We visited in early June, so it was not crowded at all. If you do visit during peak months and want to get away from the crowds, try Phelps Lake, which limits hikers to 50 cars (just go early). We stayed at the Jackson Lake Lodge (which was excellent), but there are lots of other options. This is a must see if you are traveling anywhere nearby."
797,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Family, ,SO BEAUTIFUL!!!,"Going to Yellowstone and Grand Teton is such an incredible one-two punch in terms of OD'ing on the outdoors. Hard to say which one is better - Yellowstone gets the marquee billing as it was the first national park. . . but Teton gives it a run for the money in terms of sheer beauty. The landscapes are breathtaking, the hikes are phenomenal/oh so numerous to choose from and the photo opps are at every turn. If you go to Yellowstone, don't miss Teton!!!"
798,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Winters, CA ",Our guide went above and beyond what we expected.,"We booked the Grand Teton National Park Sunset tour as a follow up to participating in a half marathon the day before so we wanted something where we could see wildlife and beautiful scenery without a lot of walking. Our tour guide George found out our interests and then did everything he could to make sure we saw everything on our list. The only thing we did not get to spot was a grizzly bear. But with wildlife there are no guarantees. George has immense knowledge of the area and the wildlife that call it home. We were so excited to see all that we could he agreed to keep driving and we had our dinner when we arrived back at our condo. When we got out of the van we were all on an incredible high and could not stop talking about the experience. Oh, and the Bigfoot story was a great way to end the night."
799,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Family,"Alma, WI ",Better than Yellowstone,"We saw a lot of animals.    Grizzly & black bear, elk, buffalo, pronghorn, moose, coyote, mule deer. Prairie dogs & pika.

803,Grand_Teton,May 2017,not available,"Sydney, Australia ",Better than Yellowstone,"Absolutely loved this national park and the Grand Tetons Mountains. It is no under-rated in comparison with Yellowstone National Park. The scenic drive along Teton Park Road is fantastic and make sure you stop at many of the scenic stops around Jenny lake, Dam spillway and of course Moose where you get some great views of the Grant Teton Mountains. Loved this park and would highly recommend spending say 3 - 4 hours enjoying all the sites.    This would have to be one of the more scenic parks in America by far"
804,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Family,"Keller, TX ",Breathtaking view everywhere.,"Spent 2 days in Grant Tetons & Jackson, WY. Nice downtown. We have taken snake river boat tour and safari ride, which were worth every bit. Safari Ride was a bit costly for the wild life we saw."
805,Grand_Teton,May 2017,not available,"Peoria, AZ ",Majestic!,"Driving to the park was very scenic and approaching the Grand Teton was majestic but misleading. It's not just another mountain. After we entered the park, we drove to Jenny Lake. The approach to Jenny Lake was like out of a magical story - evergreens dappled in snow hanging to create a canopy over the road. Then the lake appears - beautiful, pristine, crisp, serene - with the mountain overlooking and a gentle breeze. Picture perfect! Loved it! One of my favorites!"
806,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Malibu, CA ",Outstanding scenery!,"We had such a lovely time in the Tetons, the scenery was absolutely spectacular! I enjoyed the scenery here so much more than Yellowstone. It was right up there with Rocky Mountain National Park if not topping it. We hiked the NE section of the Jenny Lake trail and also Leigh Lake. The park is quite easy to navigate and it wasn't terribly crowded. We especially enjoyed Jenny Lake and Leigh Lake. Some overlooks that I recommend are the following: Blacktail ponds, Schwabacher landing, Oxbow bend, Cascade Canyon, Jenny Lake overlook, and the dam near signal mountain. Of course, you have to drive along Mormon row. I was not as impressed by Gros Ventre road. Signal Mountain and Part of the Jenny Lake trail were closed.    I thought we would leave the Tetons without seeing any major wildlife, but as we were about to leave the park, we passed by a bear jam. It was a thrill to have a close up view of a grizzly and her two baby cubs! We stopped and I stood outside viewing them for about thirty minutes. The rangers did a great job of keeping everybody safe.    For heavens sake, wear proper footwear here. All of the people walking down steep, rocky embankments in sandals were making me a nervous wreck. If you don't have hiking boots, at least wear good sneakers.    We packed summer sausage, plain mustard, cheese, crackers, peanut butter, granola, dried fruit, and whole wheat tortillas so that we didn't need to eat out much in the park.    Don't make the Tetons a quick day tour from Yellowstone. I preferred the Tetons and recommend spending at least 1.5-2 days here so that you have time to do some hiking."
807,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Plano, Tx ","Beautiful park, but crowded","Every positive review is true about the beauty of this place. The scenery is amazing and the hiking very good, but the parking lots were full at many of the trailheads, forcing people to park on the road or in the grass, wherever they could squeeze in. We were blocked in at one point when someone jammed their small car behind us. The park really should consider a shuttle service like Grand Canyon. Would make this park much more enjoyable not having to worry about parking. Definitely visit but bring your patience."
808,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Friends, ,Chapel of the Transfiguration,This could be easily overlooked by the unknowing visitor. The Chapel is right off the main road and definitely worth a stop. The view from inside the Chapel is breathtaking.
809,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Family,"New York City, NY ",Outstanding and very relaxing scenery!,"Visiting it after Yellowstone, as many people do. It is much smaller, and you can drive around the whole park in an afternoon. We drove through it on the way to Jackson in the evening and saw one half of the scenic loop drive. The next morning we drove back up and around the whole loop. The scenery is breath taking and unusual. There are also lakes and wildlife, in addition to snow topped mountains, covered with trees. There are many hikes and trails and bike routes for those so inclined. Many people seemed to park, and then go for a bike ride. Don't miss it. It is as good as Yellowstone, but different!"
810,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017,not available,"Huntersville, NC ",Wow!,"We spent a few days enjoying Yellowstone, then came down to the Tetons. We thought nothing would top Yellowstone for scenery, but we were wrong. The mountains in Teton took our breath away. We did not see much wild life, but again we are not an early rising family. However, you can enjoy the mountains anytime during the day."

812,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Family,"Seal Beach, CA ",Absolutely stunning,"This is one of our two favorite National parks (the other is Rocky Mountain Park). It is even more picturesque and awe inspiring than Yosemite. The variety includes mountains, bush covered plateau-rangeland, the Snake River (awesome with the spring runoff), and Jackson Lake. There are lots of animals for viewing, especially buffalo herds. Lodging in the park tends to be expensive and overbooked, but good places can be found in nearby Jackson and Teton Village ski area. We just enjoyed at stay at Spring Valley Ranch."
813,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Couples,"Eugene, Oregon ",GRAND!!,"The first word says it all! We have been here several times over the past 30 years, but this is the first opportunity to comment about it. We camped at the Signal Mountain Campground for 4 nights. Despite some lingering snow banks, and a late spring snow storm, everything was about perfect. Our camp spot was near a CLEAN toilet and water spigot, and we were within easy walking distance of hot showers, Jackson Lake, and the SM Lodge and store area.    We did several hikes near Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake Lodge. We also rode the nice paved bike trail round trip between Jenny Lake and Moose (we would have ridden to Jackson Hole, but we got started too late in the day). Except for our first day with snow which blocked the view of the Tetons, every morning and evening view was spectacular.    We wanted to launch our kayak, but the water was still tooo cold for us. And the higher flow was more than we backwater paddlers wanted to manage; there were many others who did take commercial rafts down the Snake River.    The wildlife was wonderful - bear cubs and moose calfs. Plus lots of birds, deer, and elk.    We plan to return again."
814,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Couples,Escondido ,Spectacular!,"We stayed in West Yellowstone, and took a day to visit Grand Teton NP. The mountains are beautiful! The Teton's reflecting in the waters of Jenny Lake are breath taking. We checked the weather forecast before we went, to pick the best day to go. We passed through there again 3 days later on our way home, and it was snowing. There were so many clouds, you would never know there were these huge mountains so close to us. The last few times we've been to Moose Junction, we have actually seen a moose!"
815,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Greenville, SC ",Every turn is amazing,So much to see in the National park it should take you several days. We started at the Craig Thomas visitor's center who gave us lots of help in planning the best use of time. They also have a great video and diaoramas of the area. There are so many turn offs as you drive but each one offers a different perspective.
816,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Scenery is impeccable,"From the north to the south, the drive and turnouts are worth it all. Not many places you see a high altitude lake rise straight into 14,000 foot rock mountains.    Wildlife abounds in this park almost as much as Yellowstone.    Killer trail hikes but still places for those that can't access them.    Loved Grand Teton NP."
817,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Couples,"Bedford, VA ",Beautiful place to visit,"National Park definitely a must see place on anyone's bucket list. Stunning vistas, wildlife, informative rangers. A must-see!"
818,Grand_Teton,Jun 2017 , Friends, ,Nature at its best!,"The Teton range is spectacular! The park affords easy and close up access to the mountains. A variety of trails take you along mountain streams, tranquil lakes and summits with awesome views. There is something for all abilities, from driving the park loop and stopping at the overlooks, to overnight backpacking hikes. Access to National parks is affordable and if you plan to do multiple parks within a year, the annual pass is well worth the money."
819,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Family,"Houston, TX ",Jenny Lake hike,"We had heard that the Cascade Canyon hike was very popular but not too difficult. Given that we were there in mid may, which is just prior to the beginning of the busy season, we thought we would try it. We read that you could hike a couple miles to the trailhead from the south side parking lot, or ride the ferry across the lake. Unfortunately, both the ferry and trail to get to trailhead were not open. We stopped in at the rangers station near the parking lot and a very experienced ranger recommended driving up the road to the north side of the lake and approaching it from that end. We did that and experienced a beautiful hike along the west side of the lake. We saw marmots and osprey and a few stumps that looked like bears. I did an informal poll of the hikers and about 50% were carrying bear spray. Finally, we got to the end of the trail that had a turn off to inspiration point. It wasn't clearly marked and much of it was snow covered within the trees. There weren't many people at that point, and without bear spray we felt we should turn back. In the summer it will be fine. On the way back a marmot confronted us on the trail but scurried off."
820,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Friends,"South Portland, ME, ",Must add on to Yellowstone,"This National Park is absolute stunning. Within 60 minutes of the South Gate to Yellowstone, do not bypass this park. Rarely does a National Park give you the iconic image from every place in the park. The Teton vistas are present throughout. We unfortunately only had two days so we hired the excellent company, Eco Tours, to tour the park and look for wildlife. The Tetons are known for their wildlife viewing versus Yellowstone which is more geologically based (hot springs, waterfalls, etc). We also did a float trip with ""Solitude"" down the Snake River which allowed for more stunning Teton views. We did have time for one hike on Jenny Lake which I highly recommend. Yellowstone is massive with tons of tourists. The Tetons have many tourists as well but just feels more accessible and we enjoyed it immensely."
821,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Couples,"San Antonio, TX ",Absolutely loved it!,"Great hiking and wildlife watching! Even though it was Memorial Day weekend, the crowds were not bad. Get there early for the most solitude. We saw elk, moose, deer, lots of birds, and one grizzly bear. Amazing place."

The south exit from Yellowstone was closed until the next day. So we had to exit Yellowstone from the West end and travel through Idaho to get to Jackson Hole. The park is amazing but stop at the visitor's center first to get first hand info on where the wild life is located at the time you visit. The trails are awesome and the ""PAVED"" bike paths are like none I have ever seen in a National Park."
833,Grand_Teton,May 2017,not available,Tucson ,Awe inspiring,"May is a wonderful time to visit Grand Tetons. We had four days of beautiful weather with sun glistening on the snow covered mountains.

835,Grand_Teton,May 2017 , Couples,"Sydney, Australia ",Beauty to behold.,"We stayed at the Lodge at Jackson Hole, and the afternoon of our first day stopped off at the Jackson Hole Visitor Centre to get our bearings, it's 10 minutes north of the main Jackson Hole, and were advised of the loop within the Park would only take 2-3 hours.  The next day we stopped at the Grand Teton National Park Visitor Centre, viewed the film and exhibits, then set off up Hwy 191, to do the loop anti-clockwise, leaving the passenger with the better view of the mountains on the return journey.  Spectacular, awesome, majestic, words fail to describe this beauty, the Teton Range is so close, one must stop somewhere near Jenny's Lake, and experience the wonder, get out of the car, breath the air, and enjoy the stunning scene."

842,Grand_Teton,Jan 2017,not available,"Philadelphia, PA ",Snowshoeing and Snowmobiling,"No matter what season you visit here, this park is amazing. Last went during winter, and had a guided tour from a national park ranger for free, so I'd say don't waste any money on a paid for guided tour. Also went snowmobiling in the surrounding area, ended up being one of the greatest days ever."
843,Grand_Teton,Jun 2016 , Family, ,The View alone is worth the visit,"The view was essentially the greatest aspect of the visit, which is saying something due to how excellent the park was in general. The nature and wildlife was spectacular, some animals that I had never seen before were in abundance, and the trails were great. The Hidden falls/Inspiration point was by far the most fun part of the park, yet the mountains themselves are what you come for. Gorgeous, scenic, and picturesque are all that needs to be said about the views."
844,Grand_Teton,Feb 2017 , Solo,"Haifa, Israel ",The view is breathtaking. The ski trail was less impressive.,"During a winter the park is covered by snow and looks as infinite white plateau. The cross country skiing option is immense. Naturally the place is designated for the cross country, with the trail which was supposed to be groomed.  In the fact, the trail was totally ruined by high-school youngsters which decided to walk on it.  The path to Jenny lake takes about 4.5 miles X2, a good workout for the non-experienced and endless scene of the white all around and forests and foggy mountains on the back plane. So definitely worth it!  Fee entry was 10$. Can get only by car. Parking was free and abundant."
845,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016,not available,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates ",Amazing!,"if you are a nature lover, you shouldn't miss out this part of the US. There are many interesting tracking trales, and you can easily spend a week enjoying the nature here.  Rent a car and make a two days visit is a minimum."
846,Grand_Teton,Jul 2016 , Family, ,An Excellent View All Around,"The beauty is breathtaking and the trails are an amazing hike. To start off, the mountains are breathtaking and everything about the park is beautiful. I’m from Ohio so I hadn’t seen nature like this before. I went with my family to go hiking after we heard so many good things from the hikers at Glacier National Park and family friends. Even after it was described to us, we still were not prepared for the park. I only went for a week but I feel that I was barely able to hike at all, and take in much of the park. Another amazing thing about the par is the wildlife. Grand Tetons National Park has an amazing diversity of life. For example, when I was hiking one of the trails towards the end of my trip, my mother and father split off from my brother and I, but we ended up seeing a grizzly bear. Another example was on the first day, we were hiking around the lake up to the mountains because we didn’t want to take the ferry, and we got to see a mother moose and her cubs. The Tetons are an amazing view, regardless of where you are. The previous year my family and I went to Yellowstone and Glacier National Park, and we heard that we should visit the Tetons. So the next year, we rented a cabin at a KOA near Jackson Hole WY, and drove into the town. Jackson Hole is a nice small town, that is about as active during the snowy season as it is during the summer. During the day, my family would travel to different spots in the park or beautiful lodges. Overall, the Tetons are a wonderful, beautiful place and if you’re in the area, they’re definitely worth visiting."
847,Grand_Teton,Aug 2016 , Couples,"The Hague, The Netherlands ",Stunning beauty...,"I have visited the Grand Teton National Park in the winter and in the summer... so, this review will not cover Spring and Fall.    Winter. The park is beautiful but can be inaccessible. The road to Yellowstone is shutdown. The snow can be very deep and you will need appropriate equipment to negotiate any trails or off-road paths. That said, there are many beautiful views to enjoy.    Summer. I took my Harley up to Grand Tetons and then rode through Yellowstone. Excellent ride. Incredible views. Worth the road trip!"
848,Grand_Teton,Aug 2016 , Family,"Great Neck, NY ",Dramatic views everywhere,"Very picturesque mountain range. Flat land that suddenly juts up into the sky. The peaks are rugged and dramatic, and made for beautiful views throughout the park. Lots of nice hikes and activities to do with the mountains making for a perfect backdrop to them all."
849,Grand_Teton,Apr 2016,not available,Dallas ,LOVE the Grand Tetons!,"Magnificent looking! And with the lakes in the foreground, picture-taker's delight! Stop at Jackson Lake Lodge just to see the views from the lobby, deck & grounds if nothing else."
850,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016,not available,"Saint Charles, MO ",Breathtaking,We drove through and stopped to hike in Grand Teton national park for 4 days after a trip through Yellowstone. So glad that we split our vacation time between Yellowstone and here. The beauty in Grand Teton is just as breathtaking as Yellowstone!
851,Grand_Teton,Aug 2016 , Friends,"Cleveland, OH ",The View,These mountains are beautiful. I saw them in the morning and was memorized. This happened to be my uncle's favorite part of the trip. It wasn't as crowded in the morning. We also lucked out because the south entrance to Yellowstone was closed the day before due to a fire. It definitely saved us a ton of time with it reopening.
852,Grand_Teton,Jul 2016 , Couples,"San Jose, CA ",Spectacular mountains,Spectacular mountains which have a fairly vertical rise. Totally worth a visit. Wasn't lucky to see any wildlife other than the bison though.
853,Grand_Teton,May 2016 , Couples,"Akron, OH ",Spectacular park,This park is very beautiful. Just driving through my wife and I kept stopping to take pictures. Both of our jaws were hanging open the whole time. If you are in the area you HAVE TO GO.

Another place we always saw moose was Moose Wilson Road inside the park. Such an awesome national park to explore with it's stunning peaks, endless views, trails, lakes, and wildlife. The best time to see wildlife is in the morning and evening hours. Very little traffic early or late in the day."
858,Grand_Teton,Jun 2016 , Family,"Muncie, IN ",Beautiful sights and hikes.,"Compared to Yellowstone, it's less crowded and touristy, but lacks the animals. The hike around Lake Jenny is great, but wore out my family who took boat back."
859,Grand_Teton,May 2016 , Friends,"Minneapolis, MN ",A underrated and unexpected national park gem!,"I had very little knowledge of Grand Teton National Park prior to my first visit there. I had seldom even heard the park mentioned in my entire life. I was disappointed that such a wonderful national park eluded my list of travel destinations for so long.    I believe that Yellowstone takes many would be visitors from this destination, and it overshadows this wonderful gem.    I would recommend this park to anyone who is visiting the area to see Yellowstone. Try to set aside a few days to explore and camp in this area. There are more ""civilized"" accommodations available too for those who don't enjoy being immersed in the great outdoors as well!    There are a lot of great hikes, and the weather is pretty decent for late spring through autumn. If you are a nature lover, this is a great spot to go to. I saw brown bears, black bears, elk, mule deer, a moose, and more!    Do yourself a favor and check out this underrated gem. You won't regret it!    If you have more interest in reading about this location check out my profile and head to my website. I have a blog entry on my time spent there among other places in the world.    -Eric"
860,Grand_Teton,Jul 2016 , Family,"Lafayette, OR ",We liked it better than Yellowstone!,"Yellowstone Park was beautiful and fun but maybe because we are from Oregon, the terrain was actually not something we don't see often in our own state. Of course, the geysers were a one-of-a-kind sight to behold and that alone was worth the trip. But the Tetons made me feel like we were in Switzerland or something. Just such majestic mountains. SO glad we came south to see them! My husband, kids and in-laws took the Jackson Hole tour up high and enjoyed the views immensely there."
861,Grand_Teton,Jul 2016 , Solo,"Houston, TX ",A Nature Lovers Must,"If you love nature and natural trails, head to Grand Teton National Park. Get there early! Parking can get difficult so get there early to get a spot in the parking lot or you will be parking along the sides of the road and walking. We started with walking around Jenny Lake to get to Inspiration Point. It was a moderate hike but nothing too terrible. It has some beautiful spots to stop and take pictures. Unless you are an experienced hiker, plan on taking the boat back when you get to Inspiration Point. Inspiration Point is completely worth the trek it takes to get there. It is moderate and uphill, not for those scared of heights as there are some places where you walk close to the edge. There are two beautiful places to stop and rest on the way up, and it is quite a ways up, more than we thought originally, but completely worth it. A MUST see!  Taggert Lake and Bradley Lake are also beautiful hike. Taggert is a relatively easy hike and a perfect place to spread out and eat lunch. Bradley Lake is 1.4 miles from Taggert Lake. I think it is more beautiful than Taggert, its is not a hard hike. However, there isn't a sign when you get to Bradley Lake. When you get to the sign for 2.1 miles back to Taggert Parking, continue a little father and you will get to a beautiful opening to Bradley Lake, it is a perfect spot to dip in your feet in. One of my favorite spots we went to."
862,Grand_Teton,Aug 2016 , Couples,Wilmington ,"Spectacular views as well as amazing wildlife viewing, hiking, trail riding, & fly fishing.","If you are looking for a getaway from the hustle and bustle, this is the place. The views are next to none and so is the wildlife viewing. We trail rode daily through the park, as well as hiked numerous trails. A favorite trail that we hiked was Cascade Canyon, along Jenny Lake. Fly fishing on the Snake River was also a favorite. We loved everything about the Grand Tetons and will definitely be back someday soon!"

It's simply breathtaking and I could just stare at the mountains for 2 days and don't get tired of it. I went there camping with a friend after camping in Yellowstone and it was such a special experience. The drive is BEAUTIFUL. I'm from Brazil and I lived in the US for 14 months and in my opinion the national parks are just America's biggest treasure.

867,Grand_Teton,Jul 2016 , Family,"Glenwood Landing, NY ",96 miles,"The night sky slowly fades into the soft colors of the early dawn. Bleary-eyed and tired we cross over and into the city limits of Jackson Hole Wyoming; we stop at the first open gas station to fill up, stretch and get coffee. There is a slight comfortable chill in the air, it feels refreshing and after a few sips I get my second wind, with a sublime enthusiasm we continue on.    Jackson’s Hole as it was originally named is a town established by fur trappers in the early 1800”s, nestled between mountain ranges it offers endless amounts of outdoor adventure, summer and winter, however it’s the ski season that echoes the popularity of this once quaint cowboy town with its photographic backdrop.    As we drive through the streets waiting only on traffic lights the sky begins to brighten allowing full view of restaurants, art galleries, and high-end shops. We slowly browse while driving and quickly arrive at the outskirts of town to our next stop Yellowstone National Park.    This mere stretch of road that cover the gap between Jackson Hole Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park is one of the most breathtaking and memorable drives that can be experienced. Plan ahead, It’s best to start early at first sunlight and miss the summer caravans of traffic. The loneliness of the road is calming and thought provoking and with some luck deer and elk can be spotted so stay alert.    As the morning light brightens, there on the horizon, rises one of the most wondrous sites scenic views to gaze upon; The Tetons, the most majestic and jagged mountain ranges in the western part of the United States. From afar the light gently cascades upon them illuminating their snow-capped peaks with shades of pinks, oranges and purples. Speechless and envious, I feel small and humble as we gaze upon their grandeur. I want to reach out and touch them and be part of them knowing that I am in the presence of something much greater than I."

A lot of other people feel the same way, and are usually looking for animals and not other cars and bicyclists, so be on alert.    A lot of people speed through Grand Teton on their way to Yellowstone. Each park has a lot to offer. Spend a little time in Teton, the vistas are hard to beat anywhere.    They don't tell you, but hiker/bikers are always accommodated, even with the campgrounds are full to the brim. Say hello to your fellow campers, they might know about the most recent sighting of animals or a special place they found in the park."

873,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Solo,"Winnipeg, Canada ",This mountain range is grand!,"Lots of hiking and biking trails, lots of visitors but we filter out throughout the park, the visitor centres are great with lots of geology books. Key point: while the mornings in Jackson Hole (where I was staying) were rainy, cold and downright miserable, if you drive into the valley the weather can change dramatically. After one morning where it rained so hard you could see the raindrops, the afternoon produced lots of clouds with blue sky and a temperature of 17 degrees C. You could however see those nasty rainclouds hovering over the actual mountain range."
874,Grand_Teton,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Townsville, Australia ",Grand Teton National Park,"Such a beautiful place and a true feast for the eyes. The Grand Teton ranges are just magnificent and there are so many viewpoints to visit. The Moose Visitor Centre is a must and the friendly Park rangers will help you plan your visit and give you some local knowledge and hints on what to visit. Wildlife is abundant one day, scarce the next so it is the luck of the draw. We had 3 days there and were blessed with wildlife encounters on day 2 and 3."

No need to compare it with anything else - all of these parks are unique, beautiful and worthwhile in their respective ways. You do need the weather to be kind in your visit here. Know several people who have left here disappointed and unfulfilled - seeing nothing. If you do get the weather, some of our highlights (reviewed individually) were Mormon Row, a bike ride along Teton Park Road, Grand View Point and the Jenny Lake Trail.    Grand Teton itself, seemed to be clearest first thing in the morning. On both days of our stay, it clouded over in the mid afternoon. Perhaps something to bear in mind in your planning.    Extraordinary beauty here - one of so many beautiful parks in the USA - this country is blessed by nature."

883,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016,not available,"Durham, NC ",Can't wait to go back!,"We absolutely loved our time at the Grand Tetons! The park offers so many great trails and spectacular views. Two days was no where near enough time to really enjoy what this park has to offer.    We spent a fair amount of time talking to the Rangers to find the best day hikes in the park. The Rangers are so knowledgeable! Be sure to speak to them if you have never been to the park before. There is a fee to get in the park. I believe it was $30 per car. But really, just by the National Park pass. It gets you in all the parks for free for a year and is only $80.    Even though we were only day hiking, we took day packs with water, snacks and emergency supplies (because you can't be too prepared). Some of the day hikes are challenging. So you will be happy to have that extra water and snacks.    There are lots of great places to pull off and park. Make sure you have a map since some roads are one way or loop back. There are also plenty of places to eat. So plan to spend lots of time in the park.    Can't wait to get back and do more than just day hiking!"
884,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Richmond, VA, ",Spectacular!,"I think that Grand Teton National Park is an afterthought, or just a side trip, for a lot of people visiting Yellowstone. It certainly can be a destination, not just a ""drive through"" on the way to Yellowstone. Lots to do there!"
885,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Couples,USAFret ,Great mountain views,The mountains you see on the road through the park are superb. The glaciers alone were worth the trip. The loop takes you through some spectacular scenery and the splashes of fall color really accentuated the experience.
886,Grand_Teton,Jul 2016 , Family,"Redwood City, CA ",Stunning,"We loved Grand Teton, possibly more than Yellowstone, which is saying a lot. We saw wildlife everywhere all the time, and the views stopped my heart. Easy access to Jackson Hole airport and the quaint town. Talk about big skies and stars galore! We didn't get to take the boat ride out to Elk Island because we only had 2 days, but we heard it was fantastic."
887,Grand_Teton,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Leland, NC ",Views of the mountains!,From Teton Village we took Moose Wilson Road thur the lower part of the park. Much of this road is not paved and quite a bumpy ride. Worth it though as the scenery is breathtaking since the trees were starting to turn beautiful colors. We saw a mother moose with her baby. It snowed the next day but the cloud cover prevented any great shots of the Tetons. What we were able to see was awesome.
888,Grand_Teton,Oct 2016 , Couples,"San Francisco, CA ",Breathtaking in every sense but take your time,"I made a mistake and only scheduled two days... Oxbow Bend (amazing for beavers and moose), Signal Mountain summit (for 360 degree panoramic views), Jenny Lake (to experience what crystal clear mountain water is like), Antelope Flats (for pronghorn and bison, both of which we saw) and Jackson (for a little fun) was all we really had time for. This place is much more than the little brother of Yellowstone - there's abundant wildlife, the vistas must be seen to be appreciated (and remind us that the national parks were indeed our best idea!!!), and if you're the usual stressed out corporate type like I am, there's no better replenisher of the soul than putting your feet up at Oxbow Bend along the river, and just watch the sun set. Magic for all ages."
889,Grand_Teton,Oct 2016 , Couples,"San Diego, CA ",GTNP is a must see!,"The views are absolutely breathtaking. Stop by the visitors center and get a hiking trail map. We hiked to Inspiration Point on day one (early Oct), and it was a good, heart-thumping HIKE... and totally worth going all 6 miles. It actually started snowing on us about half-way up. The view was stunning, even with the low lying clouds. I can't wait to go back and see it on a clear day. We tried a few other trails, all amazing and peaceful. We saw a Grouse, Deer, Elk, Chipmunks, Osprey, but luckily no bear. I highly recommend seeing GTNP at least once in your lifetime, especially if heading to Yellowstone. I actually liked GTNP better!"
890,Grand_Teton,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Saint Louis, MO ",Great Day!,"We went through Grand Teton National Park after a 2 day trip to Yellowstone. It was an easy drive and a lovely day. We left Yellowstone out of the South Entrance and continued south to Grand Teton NP. The nice thing about Grand Teton is there were lots of overlooks and places to view scenery without having to hike 3 miles. The map showed overlooks and parking areas. We stopped at most of the overlooks and Mormon Row and exited out the South part to Jackson WY. It is a place you could spend a lot or a little time enjoying. A half day was fine for us. We saw a lot of Elk and some antelope. I enjoyed seeing Mormon Row in particular. October was a good time of year to go-pretty trees, animal activity, not crowded. The only negative to going that time of year is the uncertainty of weather. We got lucky with a little snow but not enough to hinder our plans."
891,Grand_Teton,Oct 2016 , Friends,"Thunder Bay, Canada ",Must do on the way to Yellowstone,"I'm embarrassed to admit that I hadn't heard of this National park, but decided to visit on the way to Yellowstone; I am so glad I did.

We love seeing the wildlife in the Park. This trip we saw Elk,Moose,Bison,Fox & finally we saw a Grizzly! I'll Post photos to share. The GTNP is between Jackson Hole, WY & Yellowstone National Park. We spent the last two weeks in the area. Oct seems like the best time to see the animals. Some Fall color was still showing but we missed the best color."
894,Grand_Teton,Aug 2016 , Couples,"United States, ",One of the Best Ways to Yellow Stone Park,"We entered the Yellow Stone Park from several gates, this one was the best. The driving through was pleasant and beautiful, we saw natural scenery and wild lives."
895,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Solo,"Las Vegas, NV ",Just Spectacular!,"Everyone is right; this is a must-see National Park. Do try and visit during the Fall in late September when the trees are turning and the first snow has fallen. The colors rival New England at it's best and the majesty of the towering, stark, rugged mountains is just hypnotizing. Give yourself at least a full day to take in views from different areas; they are all equally spectacular!"
896,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Couples,"North Carolina Mountains, NC ",One of my favorite national parks ever!!,"We recently spent several days in the Grand Tetons and were fortunate enough to catch the foliage at peak. The snow-capped Tetons were truly an awesome sight to behold. Add to that the bright yellow-gold of the aspens and cottonwoods and you have a photographer's heaven. We saw quite a bit of wildlife, but you really must be up early to see the best ""show"". A bull elk and his ""harem"" entertained us royally one early morning. His bugling was a real treat! We also saw moose near Gros Ventre and lots of pronghorns and bald eagles along the banks of the Snake River. Don't miss doing a rafting trip down the Snake River! It was wonderful, and our guide was extremely informative. I recommend the pulled-pork sandwich at Signal Mountain Lodge. Also, have lunch at the fancy restaurant at Jackson Lodge. The views are magnificent and the food is excellent! For hiking, do the loop around Jenny Lake and don't be afraid to venture off the trail and down to the pebble beaches on the lake. Take time to build a rock tower and just take in the serenity. I can't say enough about the GTNP!!"
897,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016,not available,"Toms River, NJ ",Beautiful park,This is a beautiful national park that you can tour or just drive through on your way to Yellowstone National Park.

899,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Rochester, NY ",The Highlight of my Trip!,"Grand Teton National Park was scenic stop on our Caravan Bus Tour. I was truly stunned and speechless. I was not prepared for the beauty of these mountains. What's more amazing was how close we were able to get to the base of the mountains on our tour. You can get so close and the rock is so massive, it really makes you feel small and humble. Of everything I saw on the trip the Grand Tetons overwhelmed me with awe and wonder. If you ever have the chance to visit this place DO IT!!!"

902,Grand_Teton,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Lafayette, IN, ",Stunning Surprise on way to Yellowstone! Stupendous Park!!!,"We cannot say enough about Grand Teton National Park. We were driving north from Jackson and stopped in the Tourist Office. A Ranger gave us a nice overview and off we went. Our drive from Jackson through the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway into Yellowstone Park's South Entrance was spectacular.    We just changed our schedule and stayed an extra day in Jackson so we could take in some of what Grand Teton's offer. You can spend a day or a week there and not experience all that there is there. At the least stop at the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center near the entrance off of Highway 89. There you will see a film with the Park history and experience exhibits featuring the wildlife and geology of this area.    The mountains are vast and stretch up to over 13,000 feet. We learned so much and gained huge appreciation for our National Park System. Even if you just head straight north to Yellowstone, stop and take the drive along Teton Park Road!"

There are many, many places to pull off of the road to take great pictures and you will want to take many. Probably too many, like we did. There are also many interesting points of interest, hiking trails and picnic areas. It is one of our favorites."
905,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Abington, PA ",Absolutely beautiful.,"What I liked best about Grand Teton is that they had lots of biking and hiking trails. It seems very bike friendly. While we didn't give ourselves enough time to drive the entire loop, what we saw was stupendous. We drove from Island Park, ID through the scenic bi-way and could see the mountains of Grand Teton almost the entire time. We will definitely return to Grand Teton to see everything we missed and even repeat some of what we did see."

909,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Glasgow, UK, ",No words can do the Tetons justice,"I expected Grand Teton National Park to be impressive but I couldn't have prepared myself for just what we experienced.    In many years of travelling across the US it was simply one of the absolute highlights. I had never been so captivated by so many views - the Tetons themselves, from the Snake River pull outs to Signal Mountain, to Jenny Lake, Lake Jackson. Simply everywhere had a world class view.    The visitor centre was really pretty and a great place to get the background before setting off.    We had purchased an annual national parks pass last year which was still valid, A fabulous way of saving money and show your support.    We will certainly return we were so taken with this national park. It really needs a couple of days to do it justice and to see the views at different times of day. The sight of an aircraft seemingly gliding effortlessly down into Jackson airport through the morning mist with the Tetons in the background made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Worth a very early start that morning to see the view at that time.    We also found the park to be teeming with wildlife - we actually saw far more variety here than at Yellowstone.    I can't wait to come back :)"
910,Grand_Teton,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Doylestown, PA ",Absolutely breathtaking!,We traveled with friends to the National Parks and our first experience was the Grand Tetons.

This place really gets into your heart and soul makes you feel so appreciative that the people that founded the area worked hard to put it aside and make a national park so we can all enjoy.  The mountains are truly Majestic. We visited in September, the leaves were changing and it was absolutely beautiful. We saw so much wildlife. Hiked around Jenny lake and to Moose Ponds (actually saw moose there)."
912,Grand_Teton,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Phoenix, AZ ",The mountains are breath taking,"We stayed in Jackson and visited the south end of the park on a afternoon drive to the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center to Jenny Lake, Signal Mountain and Jackson Lake. Stopping at the Discovery Center was a perfect start to our drive, the Rangers were very helpful. Taking the one way drive along Jenny Lake was definitely worth the extra time. We saw lots of wildlife during our afternoon drive around the park; Elk, Antelope, and Buffalo. To top it off, we had on and off snow showers that made for some beautiful scenery."

Do take the scenic drive and take tons of pictures.
921,Grand_Teton,Jun 2014 , Solo,"Phoenix, AZ ",Spectacular,This set of peaks is somewhat unique in the US. They remind me of the Alps. Grand Teton national park is adjacent to Yellowstone and you have to go through it to get to the South entrance to Yellowstone.
922,Grand_Teton,May 2014 , Couples,"Westminster, MD ",National Park,"Most phenomenal mountains I've ever seen. Still snow capped Memorial Day weekend, although we had 80 degree weather. Jenny Lake is not to be missed (west side of main road; small sign directs). Pronghorn, their young, moose, elk, coyotes, grizzly and brown bear, wolves, fresh pine scent abounds. At peace with nature. Not so crowded this time of year, and accommodation rates are quite reasonable ($65-80/hs). Didn't have time to hike, since park adjacent to Yellowstone, which we also saw in 2 days, but that would have been fabulous, as well as camping for outdoor lovers. After a winter of 500"" of snow, waterfalls were spectacular as well. Jackson has everything you need (gas, restaurants, shops) in the evening."
923,Grand_Teton,Jun 2014 , Business,"Orange, California, United States ",Most spectacular mountain scenery,"The large flat valley floor covered in wildflowers, with tall, jagged peaks jetting up straight out of the valley with almost no foothill area. There are a vast number of hiking trails and biking trails for every fitness level, and viewing areas that are accessible by car with just a short stroll to the overlook. I especially love two areas in particular to take in scenery: Schwabacher's Landing and the Jackson Lake Overlook from Signal Mountain Road. These two will take your breath away (if the altitude hasn't already done so :-)"

931,Grand_Teton,Jan 2014 , Couples,"Farmington, CT ","Majestic Mountains, Deep Tall Woods, Burbling Streams","We recently made a very specific visit to Grand Teton NP. We trekked the Granite Canyon trail on XC skis with a guide. Lucky for us, the trail had already been broken by someone, making it slightly easier for us. The entire loop took about 2 hours, including a full five to ten minutes where I fell in deep snow and it took that long get up. (Humbled!) By the looks of it, only one or two people had preceded us in the fresh snowfall but it was enough to tamp it down slightly and gave us the added advantage to having a trail to follow. Our guide brought bear spray, something I might not have known to do. While there were no bears, we did see FRESH bear tracks, unusual in late January I gather, but there they were, demonstrating that the bear spray wasn't just a superfluous splurge.  The trail was lovely, winding uphill (sometimes it seems that everything is always uphill) through forest, over streams and aspen groves. There are many other trails and trailheads; we only had time to explore one. The mountains ringing the distant views were constantly changing in the light, clouds and snow. It was quiet, beautiful and perfect.  Since we were true newbies there, our guide was indispensable; we learned what all the animal tracks were (came in handy during the rest of the week) and also the types of trees and assorted history. Restaurant verification ad recommendations, too. And, of course, that bear spray."

Just driving by is a great experience, having the endless spine out your window with its gentle rivers, long green fields and blue sky. Everyone seems to like the Tetons and with good reason.    We didn't get to do much hiking there, but just getting around the foothills was a neat experience and I enjoyed the view from far away (some day we'll go hiking up one)."

These are mountains of the imagination. Mountains that led to the creation of Grand Teton National Park where you can explore over two hundred miles of trails, float the Snake River or enjoy the serenity of this remarkable place."
939,Grand_Teton,Sep 2013 , Couples,"West Sussex, UK ",Mountain and lake heaven !,"From the sparkling blue waters the Tetons rise from the lakeshore to touch the clouds. The Fall colours are wonderful and the Glaciers still cling to the mountain side in sheltered gulleys which all makes for spectacular viewing. A stroll along the lake, a boat trip across it and a drive up Signal mountain for spectacular panoramic views are just some of the options you have to enjoy along with the views. We found it easy to find quiet spots along the lakeshore just to sit and breath in the air and surroundings, it was so peaceful you could not help but feel the 'inner calm' wash over you. Boy I wanna go back right now !"
940,Grand_Teton,Sep 2013 , Couples,"Casa Grande, AZ ",Stunning,"My wife and I visited the Tetons this past September but my most memorable visit was 40 years ago when I climbed Mt. St. John. I was only 20 years old at the time. As I look back, I can't believe I did it and I did it alone. Pretty stupid. If you have the physical ability, this is a mountain range that you should consider spending some time in. The views are simply spectacular. But even if you are a bit challenged in the hiking dept., you can't go wrong with a slow and methodical drive through the park."

Go to the visitor center (it is very good) and take the scenic loop drive. However it was so much better to see the majestic mountains at different times of the day and take a few hikes. We stayed in Jackson which was OK but next time we will make sure to stay at one of the lodges in the park to get the real experience.

We stayed in Teton Village/Ski resort. This is off season according to locals but late Summer and Fall are great times to visit the area. The mountains are spectacular with lots of picture opportunities and the wildlife are abundant. Elk, Moose, Deer and Buffalo are what we saw most of. We had deer and moose come to the place we we're staying. The only complaint was no AC and it got pretty warm during the day(80s mostly). At night the temp would drop to 40s mostly. One day we took a trip to Yellowstone and went around the inner loop. We'll have to go back when we can stay two weeks to see all of Yellowstone. Jackson Hole is a unique city with lots of shops, art galleries and bars. There's lots of other things to do in the area like hot air balloon rides and para-sailing from the top of the ski resort. Great trip."

It was less crowded (Though Jackson Wyoming was very crowded). We saw moose here, lots of elk, and generally more wildlife than we saw in Yellowstone. We found this to have better visitor centers than Yellowstone, better roads, and better scenery. And the scenery was amazing. Moose can be seen early morning along the Gros Ventre river northwest of the Gros Ventre Junction. I'm sure they are other places, but that is where we saw them. We found the Morman row to be very picturesque. We also loved the amazing Craig Thompson visitor center at Moose. You have to go there for sure. When you go to a visitor center, ask them for the driving tour. It is well worth it to get their suggestions. One place we almost didn't go to was the chapel of the transfiguration. We found that to be beautiful. I strongly recommend this park. The mountains are unlike any I've ever seen."
953,Grand_Teton,Jul 2013 , Couples,Belgium ,The most beautiful national park,"Boat on Jenny lake, cascade canyon trail, string lake trail, christian ponds trail, chapel of transfiguration, jackson lake, moose wilson road."
954,Grand_Teton,Aug 2013 , Family,"Greenville, SC ",Beautiful park,If Yellowstone did not have the geothermal attractions Grand Tetons would easily beat it in terms of sheer beauty. The majestic peaks rising behind the lake was a sight to behold. There are various look out points along the road including one with the snake river in front.    Wish we had more time to explore this park.
955,Grand_Teton,Jul 2013 , Friends,"Millsboro, DE ","...""Purple Mountain's Majesty...""","We visited the Grand Tetons as part of a 13-night Globus bus tour from Rapid City to Las Vegas. Before the trip, everyone I know who had seen the Tetons had raved about their unbelievable beauty and majesty, and so I had high expectations going in and was not the least bit disappointed.    The youngest of the Rocky Mountain chain, the Tetons stand out for their glacial, angular peaks still snow-capped in mid-summer laid out before a pair of pristine lakes and the Snake River -- their stark shadows clearly visible in the waters that lie at their feet. We had two very different opportunities to view the Tetons -- from afar and up close at several lookout points and from the Lodge where we enjoyed lunch while on our way to Jackson; and the next morning on a float trip along the Snake River. Visiting the Tetons, even in these ways, did not grow tiring; it was hard to take your eyes off these majestic mountains and cast them elsewhere.    There's only a couple of places to stay or eat in the Park itself; with close proximity to Jackson, it's probably best to stay there and spend time in the Grand Teton National Park as a day trip or two."
956,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Family,"Greenland, NH ",Huge!,Definitely worth adding the extra day. These sharp peaks 'appear' out of nowhere as you drive north on the highway and into the vast valley below them. It is hard not to find a great view on any point along either of the two highways going north. The Craig Thomas Visitor Center has excellent displays and is a must-see before you explore further in the park.
957,Grand_Teton,Jul 2013 , Family,"Eugene, OR ","Grand Teton NP, Jackson Hole, stay in Teton Village @the Hostel- if on a budget!","We are 2 adults, 2 kids, 10 and 11. We visited Grand Teton NP, Jackson Hole, WY and found a place for $100/nt at the Hostel in Teton Village, saved alot by staying there. We arranged to eat our breakfast at the hostel (an old ski lodge-from Olympic trials or? .. it seems), and ate dinner we prepared there. Saved alot of money, saw incredible animals, did alot of hiking, went to top of Jackson Hole Ski Resort (a little spendy but well worth it). the Hostel was pretty sparse, it had small bathrooms, the rooms were narrow, dark, with only one window, might be some dust in the corners, no desks or swimming pool here, but they were comfy. It had bunk beds, the floors creak --creaks alot, a large rec room in basement with a large frig for all to keep their groceries (all were labelled) and rec room included a toaster, a microwave, lots of tables and a tv, a ping pong table, and more games that i can imagine, a table just for checkers and chess. OK..it wasn't the Marriott, but neither were the prices. Alot of younger college age kids working at the place, my kids made friends with some at the front desk, and they liked their dog Cinch. I saw quite a few families, and older couples who look like they were in good shape and maybe retired but saving money while visiting the area, also saw plenty of Foreigners who know how to stay in hostels. Grand Teton NP is just up the road from the hostel, as well as Jackson Hole which has a cute historic downtown- our kids did a stagecoach ride, short and sweet for $4/each, and check out the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, too. We did alot of hiking in Grand Teton, ate lots of PBnJ sandwiches, baby carrots, string cheese, beefsticks, and always brought our own water bottles. Loved this area!!"
958,Grand_Teton,May 2013 , Family,"Madison, Wisconsin ",Don't miss this park,"Grand Teton had been on my list of parks I wanted to visit for a long time. I am so happy we included it in our trip to Wyoming. It is a fairly small park, so you can see and do much of the park in a visit of a few days. Except for the hike to Hidden Falls, which you can get to by boat, so it attracts a lot of people, most of the trails were very quiet and we saw few other people. We stayed in Teton Village just outside the ""back"" entrance to the park, so we were able to get into the park very quickly. Great hikes, beautiful scenery and lots of animals--elk, deer, moose. We saw several beaver dams, but no beavers."
959,Grand_Teton,Jul 2013 , Couples,"Newnan, GA ",Awesome View and Fun,"We visited the National Park and the Grand Tetons cannot be adequately described or shown in pictures. It is truly stunning. From the first view of the mountain range visitors will be impressed with the beauty of the place. We took the ferry at Jenny Lake across to the Jenny Lake trail head. We then hiked up to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. Those are .5 and 1.0 miles from the ferry landing respectively. The trail was pretty busy all the way up.    Once we were past Inspiration Point the number of hikers dropped of to very few. We proceeded all the way up Cascade Canyon to the crossing and then took the trail toward Lake Solitude. Due to the lateness of the day we only got about a mile up that trail (just past the tree line) before we needed to turn back to catch the last ferry back across the lake. Our total distance was just about 11 miles. The ferry is $16 per person and if I recall a good bit less for seniors. Veterans can take it at no charge. The last ferry is at 7pm but if you miss it you can hike the trail around Lake Jenny which will add 2 miles to your total hiking for the day.    The views were spectacular. The trail ranges between moderate and strenuous; with most of it being moderate in terms of difficulty.    Along the way we saw moose, deer and marmots and fortunately no bear; although we saw bear scat on the trail. Hiking in the Tetons is quite safe provided you have good boots, lots of water and carry bear spray with you. Bear spray is an absolute necessity. It runs about $40 for a canister, which may seem expensive until you stumble upon a grizzly or black bear. Then it can seem pretty cheap! Bear encounters are pretty rare but if you are one of those rare occurrences you will be glad that you have it. Traveling in a group is also a great idea because the noise of several folks can spook a bear out of the way. I wouldn't hike alone in the Tetons (or Yellowstone for that matter).    Seeing the Tetons from the base on the east side or west side is quite impressive. Hiking up for a closer view is and experience that is rewarding for first time or many time visitors.    If you love the outdoors, impressive natural views, running mountain streams, wildlife and nourishment for your soul, the Grand Tetons are for you!"
960,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Couples,"Tavernier, FL ",Beautiful,"Took a day and drove to this park, the views of the Tetons on the Lakes is unbelievable beautiful. Must go to Jenny Lake and take the ferry to the other side and hike up to Hidden Falls. Not for the weak or timid so be prepared for a short but strenuous hike. But it is worth it."
961,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Couples,"Hurricane, WV ",Purple mountains,"Fantastic view, must see, awesome. The Rockefeller Resturant  is good, take your Time, see this, close to Jackson Hole Wy, nice town, nice drive into ID, Bear Lake, on the Utah, Idaho, border."
962,Grand_Teton,Jul 2013 , Couples,"Titusville, ","A long, long day...well invested","Since we were staying at West Yellowstone we thought it would be great to take a full day and travel the 42 mile loop in the Grande Tetons and as much else as we could fit into a day. It was about 3 and 1/2 hours to Jackson where we entered the park at Moose and traveled a rough road a few miles until we it turned to pavement. Stopped at the Visitors and then headed up the Grand Teton Park Road stopping at Jenny Lake, Signal Mtn,and Willow Flats. By this time it was clear the loop would have to wait for another day and we continued on to Colter Bay and then to the south entrance to Yellowstone. Nine hours well spent in a most beautiful National Park which is very different from Yellowstone. I would recommend others who plan a similar trip to stay over a night and break the trip up over two days. We stopped and took pictures at all of the turnouts, so that added to the time. Used our senior pass."
963,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Solo,"Eugene, OR ",Gem of a Park,"This is a stunning national park, and a less hectic alternative to Yellowstone. I found it to be extremely easy to get around, and the signage was very good. I also liked that there were multiple places to eat and stay within the park. I'm only rating it a 4 instead of a 5 because I felt like even though the scenery was gorgeous, I felt like I could only spend a limited amount of time here due to the park's lack of diversity. If I had been a rock climber or such I would have had more to do, but for hiking I felt like I was seeing similar things after a couple of days."
964,Grand_Teton,Jul 2013 , Family,"Metamora, MI ","Gorgeous park, and close to Jackson","Beautiful park. Loved the mountains and wildlife. Smaller than Yellowstone, so you don't spend all day driving to get to something.  Close to Jackson, if you need anything. This city has it all.  Take the boat or hike to Hidden Falls, accross Jenny Lake (and inspiration point, if you are up to it). Well worth the 4 hours (we hiked half and road back on the boat). The mountains are majestic."
965,Grand_Teton,Jul 2013 , Couples,"Frederick, MD ",A Gorgeous Natural Landscape,We drove through and past many miles of the snow capped Tetons through and beyone Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone Lake shows them in its background and it is quite a sight. Any route that takes you past these mountains is worth it.

Its south of Yellowstone NP and has, in my opinion, beautiful relaxing lakes to visit and to hike to. the short hike to Lake Leigh is well worth it."
970,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Couples,"Louisiana, ",Fabulous park area with lots of hiking trails.,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to The Grand Teton Park. So many things to do if you like the outdoors. Gorgeous views of the mountains. Will come back.
971,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Family,United States ,Beautiful and breathtaking,"We were in the Grand Teton National Park for four nights after our 8 night trip to Yellowstone. We loved it. It was beautiful. We were there from June 26th to June 30th and the wild flowers were in abundance.  I want to thank BlueBirdDay and PeachBelle for all their suggestions and the help they gave me to plan our trip to the Tetons.  The rugged mountain range was beautiful. We followed the Park Map supplied by the Grand Teton National Park Service and covered most of the sites pointed on the map. Stayed at the Signal Mountain Lodge for 4 nights.  1st day took a drive to the Signal Mountain Summit. It was a beautiful drive with good lookout points and the top of the summit was beautiful with wild flowers in abundance. Drove on the main road south towards Jenny Lake and took the one way road to Jenny Lake overlook and then to the Jenny Lake visitor center. Parking was full. Had to change plans. Drove to Laurance Rockefeller Preserve. Waited not too long to get a parking spot and hiked to Phelps Lake.Unfortunately weather turned out to be in the mid 80's and it was just a little warm for the hike. Also visited Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center.  2nd day got early to Jenny Lake Visitor Center and took the boat across Jenny Lake and hiked up to the Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point and covered some of the points of interest on the Park Map.  3rd day took a hike to Taggart Lake, beautiful place with the Teton Range in the background. The trail was not too crowded as we went early being worried that we would not get a parking place. After the hike went to Teton Village in Jackson and took the tram to the top of Rendezvous mountain. On our way saw a glimpse of a moose. It was worth the trip even though the ticket was a little pricey. $26.00 per person. Views were amazing. We had waffles at Corbet's Cabin. They were yummy with butter and brown sugar in between. Visited Jackson Lake Lodge and viewed the Lake from their Mural Room. We also had great views of Jackson Lake from the Signal Mountain Lodge.    Had a great 4 night stay in the Tetons. The day we left we had a beautiful view from the Oxbow Bend Turnout. It is a beautiful place for photo opportunities with the reflection of the Tetons in the Snake River. Snake River Overlook is also a good place to take pictures. Took a drive over Antelope Flats road and took some photos of the Mormon Row and took the loop to Kelly and got back on the main road. Plenty of wildflowers. A few bison."
972,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Couples,"Zephyrhills, FL ",Just a stone's throw from Yellowstone.,"If you are visiting Yellowstone, be sure to drive another 90 minutes to Jackson Hole, Wyoming and see the Tetons. Their rugged beauty will take your breath away. It is smaller than Yellowstone, but it still packs a punch for activities and hiking. Your Yellowstone pass will get you into the Tetons for free. Be sure to see Jenny Lake, Inspiration Point, and Lake Taggart. If you are more of a hiking enthusiast, Amphitheater Lake will leave you breathless (literally). You have a 3,500 feet change of elevation in about 4 miles. Keep going because the pay off is worth it. Be warne that the trail will be covered with snow in higher elevations even into mid June. Just follow the footprints ahead of you. Be sure to pack plenty of water. My girlfriend and I LOVED the Tetons."
973,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Family,"Cary, NC ",More stunning around every next turn,"I travelled to Jackson, Wyoming to do some real hiking and bond-building with my 15 yr old son. We do some hiking back home in NC, but were looking for something a little more challenging. We found that and lots more! We started with a moderate hike around Jenny Lake and up to Hidden Falls and Inspiration. Immediately, we knew we were onto something special - the hike around Jenny Lake was beautiful - and then the Falls and Inspiration Point were amazing.    The next day we decided to try a tougher hike - and so we selected the Garnet Canyon trail starting at Lupine Meadows Trailhead. The hike starts with mountain meadows in full bloom and keeps getting more rugged and beautiful the further you go. It is a strenuous hike, climbing over 2000 feet. About 2/3 of the way to Garnet Creek, you round a corner and are awestruck by the view of Middle Teton (see attached photo). We continued up to the creek crossing - and somewhere around 9000 feet we ran into snow and couldn't go further. We did some free rock climbing, took lots of pictures, had a well-deserved snack, and then started back down the mountain. It's definitely easier going back down! Overall, the hike was about 5-6 hrs and about 8.5 miles roundtrip.    For our last hike, we decided to hike up into Death Canyon. This was also a very beautiful hike, along the way you get a great view of Phelps Lake. One bad thing is that after climbing about 500 ft, the trail goes back down towards the lake (dropping over 500 ft) before turning back upwards towards the mountains. It's tough to ""give up"" that hard earned altitude - but if you press on, it is worth it. About halfway up, the trail meets up with Death Canyon Creek and then follows the creek all the way up the valley. At around 8500 feet, the terrain flattens out (for awhile) and there is a ranger cabin and some flat water. From here, you can hike onwards higher up the canyon, but we decided to turn back. The walk back again was alot easier, but this time, there was some ""unexpected"" uphill - which just seemed wrong for the return trip! Overall, another great hike of about 6 hours and almost 8 miles.    We initially thought about taking the Jackson Hole Tram up to the top and hiking down Granite Canyon, but there was still too much snow at the top and so we decided not to press our luck. Later in the year, I suspect this would be a terrific route of something like 10+ miles (but mostly downhill) with duration 6-7 hours.    There are lots of traile we never made it too - and so we hope to make it back to explore those... but for the trails we did see, we rate GTNP a superstar!"
974,Grand_Teton,Jun 2013 , Couples,"Fountain Hills, AZ ",Magnificent National Park,Grand Teton National Park is spectacular. The views are unbelievable with many auto pull outs along the roads. Didn't see any wildlife and that was disappointing but the mountains were glorious. The Rangers were a cut above other parks and the gift shop had many selections. A Post Office was walking distance away. A super place to visit.

It was our second visit, and we saw incredible wildlife, despite the cold weather and season.    If you go in April, I recommend bringing snowshoes. We did not, and regretted it, as the snow was still too deep to take any of the hiking trails. I wish I'd read about the Grouse mating ranger-led trips. they go off at 5:30 am, but it sounds awesome and I wish we'd known about it.    The Teton views are incredible, and plenty of places to hike and take photos. Expect crowds in the summer, but you can also probably avoid some of the most popular trails.    This is a must-see on any National Park lover's list."

The drive through the Grand Tetons is on the same scale a Yellowstone National Park, especially in the early evening as the sun is setting and it sprinkles it's magic charm on the forestry and lakes. It's a drive of ups and downs and slow moving because cars are stopping to watch the wildlife.    It's an amazing drive and I can not find the words to describe it.
