0,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Oct 2021 , Couples,"Weatherford, OK ",Nice place for a walk,"This park has some nice, wooded hiking trails, but not much more. It would be nice if there were more signs along the way describing what we were seeing. The visitors center was closed for the winter, even though this was early in October. We did have to wait about twenty minutes for a parking spot to become available."
1,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2021,not available, ,Nice walk and amazing views,We headed out towards the lake - it was a nice walk with amazing views. The visitors center is also a must see. The architecture was breathtaking - nestled in the mountains/valley. And the varied scenery was incredible.
2,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2021,not available,"Baltimore, MD ",Nice Loop Trail to Phelps Lake,"There is a parking lot that holds about 40-50 cars (so be okay waiting if you're not there early, although they have a good waiting system with a line for cars to wait). There is a bathroom at the parking lot and a small visitor center.    We did the approximately 3 mile loop trail to Phelps Lake. It's relatively easy with some small ups and downs, we probably did it in about 2 hours with some s. There are a few lookouts to stop at along the way (including a small waterfall). The lake itself is beautiful and there are a few ""off trail"" paths to go down to the waterfront itself (the marked path doesn't get you to the water itself). Overall a very nice hike with less of the hectic crowds than Jenny Lake. We also saw a bear on the way there right on the side of Moose Wilson Rd. They recommend you bring bear spray on this hike since bears frequent this area."
3,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2021,not available,"Tampa, FL, ",Phelps Loop Lake Trail a Great Loop Hike | Great Views,"The starting point for Phelps Loop Lake Trail . the bathrooms are actually pretty nice here. - I would highly recommended to take the trail that fully circumnavigates the lake so you can catch all the spectacular views, it is well worth it. Unfortunately, we did not see much wildlife during our hike but the constant changing views of the lake made up for it! Bring water (goes without saying right) it's about 5.5-7.0 miles around the lake and back to the parking area."
4,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2021 , Family,"Rochester, MN, ",Get there early or eat lunch in the car,It is a nice hike and I have heard many say it is like a less crowded Jenny Lake hike. Disappointed in the parking situation though. I counted the vehicles and there were closer to 40 than their limit of 50 yet we had a 1 hour and 20 minute wait with 5 cars in front of us when arriving at 9am. Of course getting there something closer to 7am would avoid that but unfortunate… there are a couple restrooms on the trail that are composting. Trails are pretty well marked. We did the shortest 3 mile loop in just about an hour without an aggressive pace. The trail is rocky with several inclines and declines but pretty easy as trails go.
5,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2021,not available,"Chapin, SC ",Phelps lake and Jumping Rock,"This was a moderate hike to Lookout point, then down to the beautiful lake . My daughter,spouse and three granddaughters all made the 25 jump into the lake and earned their new screensavers"
6,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2021 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA ","Wildlife, Whitewater, and Wildflowers!","Dream hike!  Stunning, uncrowded hikes along a beautiful, rushing river to a lovely hidden lake!  The “Center” is the starting point for various hikes to/ around Phelps lake. (It’s like Jenny Lake’s lesser known and less crowded little brother.)  We took the easiest and fastest loop, which was about 2 hours with little stops for pix etc. The river is gorgeous and travels dramatically downhill.  On the way back we watched from a bridge as a deer snacked on some grass and go down into the river for a drink!  There is a small parking lot at the center. We waited in line of 10 cars (30 min) to park. You can park on the highway and walk into the center parking lot, starting point for all hikes. (Plus nice bathrooms, water fountain.)"
7,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2021,not available, ,Great start the Teton National Park,"We stopped to use the bathrooms (composting, be prepared). What we found was a beautiful easy hike and an educational center that was informative, spacious, and beautiful. We highly recommend that you visit."
8,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,May 2021,not available,"Douglass Hills, KY ",Ni e hike to the lake,Great hiking here. It is rated moderate but relatively easy for the entire family. There are also multiple options depending on how long you want to hike.
9,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,May 2021,not available,"Plantation, FL ",Worth the time,"Thanks to TripAdvisor I put this hike on our things to do list. We went early as stated and it was nice and open. The view of the lake was beautiful! I could stare at it all day. We hiked around the lake and then 2 other routes. The lake itself is 4 miles. The Creekside hike was nice and relaxing to hear on the way back. About 8 miles total. Moderate, not much elevation."
10,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,May 2021,not available,"Jackson, WY ",Great wildlife viewing in this area,"Road is a bit rough but wildlife viewing was really good. Saw Moose, elk, beaver and a big grossly bear"
11,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Mar 2021 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",A must visit site!,"This is a great hike for the whole family. You can do a short hike to Phelps Lake or a much longer hike around the whole lake. Put lunch in your backpack and head off through a beautiful wooded trail along parts of a trickling stream. Make sure you take bear spray with you. I have seen bears on more than one occasion. After your hike, stop in at their visitor’s center to learn more about the Rockefeller family and their generous donation of land for our Park’s system. Make sure to save time to watch the all seasons slide show showing the park and it’s animals in all four seasons. Then step back into the zen like room where you can sit and listen to all the sounds of the many wonders of GTNP. They only allow so many cars to park in their lot. Get their early or take a book and wait in line, in your car, for the next parking place."

13,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Oct 2020,not available,"West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA ",Great Place,We didn't intend to go to the preserve but stop after passing it while out for a drive up Moose Wilson Road. Beautiful scenery and a great hike to Phelps Lake. Next visit we will schedule some time to spend more time around the lake and the preserve.
14,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Oct 2020,not available, ,What a treat!,The Lawrence Rockefeller Preserve is so nice. We visited there last week and thoroughly enjoyed our 8 mile hike around Lake Phelps. Very beautiful location. Quiet. A little off the beaten path. Well worth the extra effort to visit.
15,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Oct 2020,not available, ,Amazing views and serene surroundings,We drove by this beautiful preserve a couple of days ago and we had the best experience. The area is magnificent and the views are amazing.
16,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Oct 2020,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Wish I had discovered it sooner!,Discovered the preserve on my last day in Jackson and did not have enough time to explore the preserve as much as I would like. One of many reasons to go back to Jackson. It is definitely on my list to revisit. Not nearly as crowded as the rest of the Grand Tetons. Very tranquil. On the Moose Wilson road so you may get lucky and see some moose on your way there.    Small parking lot so get there early.
17,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2020,not available,"San Francisco, CA, ",An absolute must!,"We didn't know about this place until we met some hikers at the Taggart Lake. They highly recommended this place to us so we checked it out that same day. This is a beautiful place and the hike is great to Phelps Lake. We we a huge bull moose that crossed our path. We of course stood clear and gave lots of clearance. On our hike back, we saw a young grizzly bear eating berries across the creek. I love this place!"
18,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Palm Coast, FL ",Special Hile,"One of the best hikes we did during our stay. Varied terrain, beautiful mountain lake and lower traffic level relatively speaking."
19,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2020,not available,"Dallas, TX ",Beautiful hike,"Would definitely recommend coming here. If you're driving from Teton Village, it's a short and easy drive through the park to get to the preserve. We did the Woodland Trail hike to Phelps Lake and then the Phelps Lake trail. Gorgeous views, easy hike! Especially good for your first day in the area."
20,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2020,not available,"New York City, NY ",Beautiful hike to Phelps Lake - kept our distance from baby bear!,This is a lovely and moderate hike with the gorgeous payoff of an uncrowned and beautiful mountain lake. A great way to spend the afternoon for a family of four including our teenage son and college daughter. We saw a baby bear on a rock 10 minutes in but know enough to keep our distance and move on - mama bear is out there somewhere! The trailhead center was closed but the restrooms were open and very nice and clean.
21,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2020,not available, ,Great place to park to hike to jumping rock on Phelps Lake,"We used this lot as a parking area for our hike to the jumping rock on Phelps Lake. Great place to park (with bathrooms and water filling station) to start a hike to the rock ledge on Phelps. Two mile hike in with stunning views. The rangers at the lot are very friendly and informative. They have trail maps and pamphlets. Get there early as the lot fills up, but if full the rangers line you up and people are always coming and going so it is not a long wait."
22,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2020,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Great Devils Canyon to Phelps Lake Hike,Park at Devils Canyon. Have to wait at Rock parking. We drove the extra miles to this more remote lot and then hiked up and down to the lake. 1200 feet vertical and 2 black bears.
23,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020 , Family,"Eugene, OR ",Part of a Yellowstone tour.,Saw a sampling of the reserve as a part of a Yellowstone tour. Stunning scenery. Would like to go back and explore this area and the Tetons more
24,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Phelps Lake Hike,Phelps Lake Hike was spot on. We had a great time and enjoyed the scenery along the way. I highly recommend this hike!
25,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020,not available,"Greenville, SC ","This was a nice, easy hike.","Easy to miss the entrance on Moose Wilson Road. The wait for a parking space was a pain, but the lower volume of hikers, and the easy grade was nice. Loved the view of the lake."
26,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020,not available, ,"Beautiful trails, saw a bear!","This preserve is in the Phelps Lake area bordering the Tetons National Park. We went on the Aspen Ridge Trail and loved it. It appeared to be a less traveled route, but easy to follow. Beautiful view of the Teton range. Walked up on a Black Bear digging into a dead stump; we were within 30 feet-just made noise and kept moving slowly away! Phelps Lake is gorgeous and has several areas to sit, take pictures or swim if you are inclined. Great place to hike!"
27,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020 , Friends,"Chicago Heights, IL ",Would go back early,We went one day and there was a wait for parking so we returned another day around 8am with plenty of parking available. The visitor center was closed due to covid but the trails were nice. I’d like to go back when the visitor center is open.
28,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020 , Couples,Boca Raton ,Lovely morning walk,"We started our hike at 7am and only a couple of other cars were there. The lake creek path was beautiful and an easy walk to the lake. We had hoped to see wildlife and didn’t, but the birds were singing and the atmosphere was so calm. We returned through the woodlands and enjoyed the sounds and crisp morning air. Someone on the path said they spotted a baby bear. I don’t know if I wanted to see it or not!! Walk was about miles in total."

30,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020,not available,"Longmont, CO ",It doesn't get much better than this!!,"It doesn't get much better than this. Although a very popular tourist hike, I am glad we decided to adventure to the LR Preserve last week. Yes, we got there and had to wait about 40 minutes for a parking spot to open, but nobody can complain about the view you have while you wait. Also a shout-out to the two park rangers who were very kind and helpful.    Don't overlook bear spray and making sure you are doing all the recommended things while in bear county. The group in front of us saw a black bear and her cub. I think sometimes this is disregarded since there is a high level of hikers on this trail.    We will be back someday when we can enjoy more time and visit the visitors center."
31,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020 , Family,"Memphis, TN ","Beautiful, secluded trails & lake","Beautiful place to hike! The summer wildflowers were stunning, lots of streams along the way to the beautiful lake. It wasn’t crowded because they only allow the number of cars that will fit in the parking lot. Phelps lake is stunning. We took the Woodland Trail to the jumping rock (we didn’t jump in but we saw people who were going to!) The view from that rock is spectacular!"
32,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2020,not available,"Houston, TX ",Summer 2020 Perfect Time to Visit!,"We have been lucky to have visited the LR Preserve a number of times. During normal times, one must wait 30-60 min+ for a parking space as they control their parking and access. However, it appears that during the pandemic (as of 7/1/20) the visitors building is closed. While the visitors center is lovely, the real gem is the walks in the surrounding pristine WY wilderness: rushing rivers, lakes, mountain vistas, lush woods full of wildlife. We pulled up around 2pm today and popped right into a parking space! The trails are still fairly heavily trafficked, but we have had worse, and the scenery is just a huge bang for the buck if your looking for a 3 mile walk that every member of your family will enjoy. If you're lucky enough to travel this summer, take advantage of this unprecedented access to the LR Preserve hikes. Stay safe!"
33,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2020,not available,"Atlanta, GA ","Great place for a hike close to Jackson, right at base of Tetons.","Great choice of hikes fairly close to Jackson. We went twice during the week. The visitor center was closed due to Covid, but the trails were all open. They are extremely well laid out, following the contours. There are two going up to Phelps Lake, and there are several spots to rest an/or picnic. At the lake, there are options to circle the lake, or branch off in other directions. The park guide has times and distances for all the legs, so you can plan your adventure accordingly. Very professionally done."
34,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2020,not available,"New Orleans, LA ",Phelps lake,Great hike to pristine Phelps Lake! There are two trails that make a loop with lots to see along the way!
35,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Oct 2019 , Couples,"Bend, OR ",Fantastic Staring Point for a Hike,"We missed open season by about a week, so we weren't able to see the inside of the visitor center. Even so, this is a fantastic place to start a hike as there are several trails of varying length and difficulty that you can access from here. There are maps at the visitor center and plenty of signs along the paths to keep you on track. You're warned in many places to be on the watch for bears, so you really should have bear spray (we didn't and I would have felt better had we planned better). The views of Phelps Lake and the snow capped mountain peaks are absolutely breathtaking. They also provide restrooms at the parking area; very basic accommodations but welcome when you're out hiking."
36,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Oct 2019,not available,"Mattoon, IL ",stunning,we did this as a drive through trip stopping to take pictures as we went. there are many trails to take for those who are more active than me
37,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2019,not available,Dubai ,Such a great place,The visitors center has a great architecture- it is fantastic that it has been donated to the use of public... the trails are nice bith long and short offers choice to everyone...
38,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2019,not available,"Reidsville, NC ",We saw moose in the field every time we went there,"When you drive up to the preserve, look in the big field on the left. We saw moose there morning and night. We also saw some fellow travelers go lie out there for some stargazing. This is far from civilization and I wanted to do it myself, but it got cloudy."
39,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2019,not available,"Bossier City, LA ",Amazing views,"This is just a part of the Jackson Hole experience you have to see to appreciate. Stunning views of the mountains, beautiful sky, and September is the right time to do it."
40,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2019,not available, ,a unique place,"If you're visiting Teton National Park, going to the preserve is a must! It's a gorgeous, pristine outdoor space with an outstanding visitor's center - complete with fireplace and quiet room. Very special."
41,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2019,not available,"Toano, VA ",Informative - Rangers Helpful,We walked around the center the first day and it is really nice with all that the Rockefeller did for the area. The second day we hiked out to the lake and the rangers let us know there were bears in the area and to be careful. Wonderful view of the lake something that can not be seen from the car. Hike was easy.
42,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2019 , Couples,san diego ca ,About the visitor center,"I see that most reviews here talk about hiking or the parking lot. I wanted to provide a review of the visitor center which is unique and focuses on the sensory experience of being in nature as opposed to facts and figures. It has inspirational quotes on the walls and video and auditory immersion experiences of the area over the seasons. Very relaxing and meditative experience. A bonus is a lodge type room with a fireplace and books and big windows to just relax or chat. So if you'd like this type of experience, be sure to visit the preserve visitor center."
43,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2019,not available,"Chicopee, MA ",Not enough parking,When we arrived we were told to pull to the side and there was 3 vehicles in front of us and that the parking was full and we would have to wait until people leave. Would have loved to visit and walk around but we couldn't leave the car unattended so after waiting about a half hour we just left.
44,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2019,not available, ,Beautiful and relatively few people,"Really pretty walks through the woods, along streams, up to Phelps lake and great scenery there. Very peaceful."
45,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Grayson, GA ",Make the effort to take the hike with a ranger,This is a great place to visit. It's even better if you can take the ranger led hike. You learn about the area as well as the Rockefeller family and their contribution to the Park. The visitor center is also unique.
46,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2019 , Couples, ,Thank you Rockefeller Family,If a walk along the trails doesn’t impact your life - nothing will. Take the tour provided daily by the Park Rangers.
47,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2019,not available,"Elkview, WV ",Beautiful Hiking Area,"Beautiful preserve and worth a visit. However, even midweek in the summer, the parking lot was full. Recommend going early morning or late afternoon."
48,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2019,not available,"Lifton, UK ","Beautiful, serene walk and lake","We walked from the Visitor Centre to Phelps Lake. We were given a leaflet detailing the trail upon arrival at the car park by a very helpful volunteer. The car park was busy at midday, but we were lucky enough to find a space.  The trail was well marked and very pretty. Phelps Lake was picture-postcard perfect and we spent a very happy afternoon exploring and paddling! We did take bear spray, but didn't encounter any wildlife on this trip, apart from a deer and the ubiquitous Chipmunks and Squirrels. We walked as far as the popular jumping rock on the far side of the lake, but I should point out that the Laurance Rockefeller Preserve are not keen on this being the focus of your visit. The rock itself is approximately 26ft high and your leap into icy water is not something you should consider doing unless you are a very competent swimmer."
49,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2019,not available,"Austin, TX ",awesome view,"this is a great place to take pictures, view the Grand Tetons, which are just awesome in person, pictures won't tell you how great they look, and with the lake in front of them, wonderful place to sit and relax, take a few pictures and make great memories"
50,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Beautiful,"We parked at the preserve and hiked to the lake. On the way we saw two bears!!! BRING YOUR BEAR SPRAY. It’s a very pretty hike, totally worth it. Parking can be tricky so come early or be patient :)"
51,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2019,not available,"St. Paul, United States ",Great place to visit!,I read about this stop long before heading to the Tetons and so glad I did!! They say only about 300 people get in here a day due to the limited parking available. We were in there by 9:20am and I would say for sure by 10am it was probably full. The area I think is probably great for hikers!! I can't give a full account on that because we have one person in a wheelchair in our party. We did however take in the full visitor center and spent some time watching their videos inside and then taking to staff. The staff was amazing and friendly. Looks like they have some really great trails for hiking and it you hike I would head out this way. If you do need to worry about accessibility I can tell you that you can make part of the hike. The staff told us that we would be able to get thru some of it so we looked to see how far we could go and so glad we did. We hiked the path until we can to a bridge my son could get on but not down on the other side because there are steps. You would be basically trying to get to a lake. But there are some fun things to see along the path and then you can be one of the few to say you have been there!
52,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2019 , Couples, ,Gorgeous,This is worth the stop. Beautiful views. Pristine. Great hiking. Read about the history of Rockefeller’s contribution to the park. Quite amazing.
53,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Phelps Lake is a wonderful hike!,The loop/ring trail at Phelps lake is a moderate/easy hike. Just beautiful. Wear your swim suit in the summer to go swimming in the crystal clear water. Took kiddos... amazing! Done in about 2 hours.
54,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Lutz, FL ",Best Kept Natural Secret,"From Moose Junction, drive past Jenny Lake into an unassuming parking lot. Take either Phelps lake Trail or Woodland Trail- plenty of wildflowers and deer. Phelps Lake is the treasure at the end of the rainbow hike. Rangers available and education center well worth it."
55,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2019 , Family,"Parkland, FL ",Hiking day trip,Good hiking trails up and over the mountain and around the lake. Gets a bit crowded later in the day. Interesting nature center and pleasant staff.
56,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Tucson, AZ ",Gorgeous area to visit,We stayed in Teton Village and the preserve was an easy drive just down the road for us. What an amazing place to hike from. Parking is small and can be challenging but it was worth the wait. Thus the 4 vs the 5 review. A comprehensive visitors center will guide you to the various hiking options. We hiked around Phelps lake to find the “ rock” a local had told us about to jump off of into the clear cool water. Well worth the experience. We’d return again and again.
57,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2019 , Family,"Lionville, PA ",Whole area is beautiful,The preserve is located on Moose Wilson road outside the entrance to Grand Teton National Park. It is a beautiful area teaming with wildlife. At the entrance to the preserve we saw a moose and plenty of mule deer great stop before you get to GTNP.
58,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2019 , Family,"Lawrence, KS ",Wonderful easy hike,"Not too long and very doable, with gorgeous views along the way (one clearing with the mountains framing brought me to tears) culminating in lovely Phelps lake. We didn’t manage to see much wildlife, a deer and a couple babies on our way out between the center and the parking lot, but it was gorgeous nonetheless. Facilities at the lake are out of commission temporarily so don’t plan on those, and go early—lots of people waiting for an opening in the lot by the time we came out."
59,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Windsor, Canada ",Beautiful scenery and a fantastic guide...,Absolutely stunning views of the Teton Mountains! Being new to the area we decided to go on a guided hike. We had the best guide ever in Cheyenne. She told great stories and got us all talking to each other. After 2 hours we felt we were all friends! Well worth the trip!
60,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2019 , Family,"Bridgewater, MA ",Hike,Great place with wonderful trails. The rangers were friendly and informed us of the wildlife (including black bears) that live in the area. Unfortunately we missed them. The visitors center is a great place too!
61,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2019 , Couples,"New Berlin, NY ",Great morning hike,"This was the first hike we took this year.Best to get here before 10:00 or you will be in a waiting que. Nice hiking trail, bonus of the view of Phelps Lake."
62,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2019 , Family,Philadelphia ,Peaceful surroundings,"The Laurance Rockefeller Preserve Center is a god place to park to hike the network of trails surrounding Phelps Lake. In June, there guides on site to answer questions and point you in the right direction. Take time to go inside the Center too!"
63,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2019 , Family,"Kansas City, KS ",Beautiful!,This was a great stop and really close to teton village. Not too far from Jackson either. Nice place and good quality. Beautiful!
64,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,May 2019 , Friends,northbrook il ,stop in,stopped in visitor center not open for the season yet we took a short hike past the visitor center to a river over look and a small waterfall well worth making a stop
65,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2018 , Couples,Anahuac ,Worth the time......,"During peak times of the year, there could be a wait to get into this popular area to hike, as they only let so many cars in at a time. We got there around 10am and had to wait but waiting in the Tetons is not a bad place to sit and enjoy. The hike is not too strenuous but does have some hills that can make you breath heavy. The lake is beautiful and great place for photos. There is also a rock overlooking the lake that you can jump 35' into ice cold water. That can be an awesome picture opportunity also for the fearless. Lots of animals.....bears, squirrels, moose, elk etc.....the visitor center is great place to visit and cool off after a hike."
66,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,May 2019 , Family, ,Must see!,We have been coming to the Tetons for years and the Lawrence Rockefeller Reserve is on of the locations we always set aside for a day of hiking.
67,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,May 2019 , Couples,"Falls Church, VA ",Beautiful hiking spot!,"The setting here is beautiful with the snow capped mountains in the background, sage brush meadows, a lake and great hiking trails. Would highly recommend!"
68,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,May 2019 , Solo,"Raleigh, NC ",Good place for a easy hike,The preserve is a good place to go for a fairly easy hike. I hiked the Lake Creek Trail to Phelps Lake and it was fairly easy. Since it was May there was some trees down that I had to climb over and snow to trek through. Overall is was a very good experience and one I would do again.
69,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,May 2019 , Couples,"San Francisco, CA ",Nature's Beauty,"OMG! Today we were privileged to seeing the majestic beauty of the preserve! The azure blue sky background, the snow covered tops of the Tetons, the winding Snake River, the lush meadows where grazing bisons had not a care in the world, all made the preserve. We felt very privileged to have seen the preserve. The snow, still piled on the ground in areas, told us about the severe winter. The aspens were just beginning to leaf."
70,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2018 , Solo,"Jackson, WY ",Nothing More Beautiful!,"Beautiful beginner's hike and introduction to Grand Teton National Park. Respect of the wildlife, terrain and surrounding area is a MUST! Bathrooms and rest area at the base of the trailhead. If visiting in the summer, go early or late afternoon as parking is extremely limited."
71,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Fox Island, United States ",Loved this place!,Laurance Rockefeller Preserve was one of my favorite highlights when visiting Jackson Hole. The area is beautiful and peaceful. The museum was a true delight and informative. I bought a few books (from Amazon) that I saw in the museum because I wanted to learn more about the Laurance Rockefeller and what inspired his heart to donate the preserve. A blessing indeed!
72,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2018 , Solo,Illinois ,Loop the Lake,An moderate hike to lake trailhead. To really make this hike worthwhile loop the lake. A few (very) moderate climbs / descents. The loop will lead you to some great views (as well as a rock formation to jump into the lake and a small sandy beach at the far end). Enjoy

76,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Oct 2018,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",Laurance Rockefeller's vision,"The Rockefeller family has given much of its fortune to philanthropy and to the preservation of the environment and to the history of the United States, such as the reclamation of Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Laurance S. Rockefeller had his own vision, a project that he hoped would serve as a model for the National Parks. It's called the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve. Located within Grand Teton National Park on the southern end of Phelps Lake in Wyoming, it covers 1,106 acres of sagebrush meadows and forests and cottonwoods and wetlands and nine miles of hiking trails. The site originally known as the JY Ranch, a dude ranch. Much of the land was purchased in 1927 by John D. Rockefeller Jr. for the creation of Jackson Hole National Monument and the expansion of Grand Teton National Park. He retained the 3,100-acre JY Ranch as a family retreat. Over the years, the family gave most of the ranch to the national park. Laurance S. Rockefeller donated the final parcel in 2001 with the stipulation that the preserve would remain a place where visitors can experience a spiritual and emotional connection to the beauty of the lake and the Teton Range. Today, the hiking trails lead through sub-alpine and wetland habitat with vistas along the southern edge of Phelps Lake. Start at the visitors center, which was dedicated in 2008, situated at the lowest elevation (7,573 feet) of the preserve. Inside, visitors are overwhelmed and fascinated by the displays and exhibits designed by cinematographers, photographers, sound recordists and writers. The visitors center was the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certified property in Wyoming. So would you expect anything less from a Rockefeller?"
77,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2018 , Family,"Edgefield, SC ",Nice hike,"We really enjoyed our hike to Phelps Lake, it was so beautiful. We did have a little peace to enjoy the view, but not for long. I am glad they have limited parking, as the trail gets crowded. Go early to get parking."
78,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2018 , Family,"Melbourne, FL ",Not quite what I expected,"For some reason I thought this was something we could spend a couple hours at, as the Center was closed for the season anyway. However, after misreading the trail map, and hiking to Moose Wilson Rd, I discovered that it is 1.7 miles just to get to the lake. I was traveling with my senior parents, who found the hike pretty strenuous (the first .7 miles). So we turned around, and never made it to the lake. So for anyone who is interested in hiking the loop, and are not fast movers (like 45 minute miles), this could realistically be an all day event. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, it does seem that parking is an issue. We had no problem, as we arrived at 8:45. But when we left at about 10:00, the parking lot was completely full."
79,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Fort Collins, Colorado, United States ",Worth a stop and hike!,"We had planned an early AM drive into Grand Teton NP and were traveling up the quieter Wilson-Moose Road when we happened upon the Preserve.It had not crossed our paths while planning our visit. It was about 7AM when we pulled into the lot. A quick look at the kiosk and we were grabbing our gear for a short hike. We did a 3 or so mile loop up to Phelps Lake and then stopped at the visitor center on the return trip which had opened at 9AM. The center is a sanctuary itself, very peaceful and insightful to its benefactor. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Preserve."

The main problem is that the parking lot is very is very small. We waited over 30 mins. The ranger controlling the parking was too busy making small talk than getting people parked. There is room to at least double the spaces by just parking on the dirt. The rangers even suggest that passengers get out and start hiking while leaving the driver to wait and catch up. Separating families is not a good way to start the visit. Very nice trails but other hikes eg Jenny Lake, Stringer etc. offer equally or better vistas."

The small visitor center is fabulous with a large relief map, video of 4 seasons in the park, and an amazing soundscape of nature sounds that you can sit down and listen to in a small meditative space. The hiking options are also great. You can do a short hike to Phelps Lake, or opt to go farther by hiking around the lake. Please note: Bring food, a water bottle, and bear spray.

96,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2018 , Friends, ,A lap around Phelps Lake,"Had a great day of hiking in the preserve around Phelps Lake. We parked on the road leading to the trailhead at the top of the overlook--7700ft. We descended down the mountainside. The views were incredible for 360 degrees. Wildflowers everywhere and a great view of Phelps Lake and the mountains surrounding lake.    The trail was challenging but easily negotiable. The lap around the lake was great. Nice views, lots of folks on the trail, and we caught sight of a juvenile black bear who decided to cross our path.    Be sure to be well-acclimated to the altitude. The hike up and down the hillside is challenging---steep in places. This hike was the highlight of our week in GTNP!"

The parking lot is small, so plan to get there early or you will have to wait for a spot (we got there at 10am and got the last spot!). The trail meanders through the woods, next to a stream, and there is a wonderful Teton lookout about halfway through the loop. There is a ranger program for the kids, which they loved and which also taught them about the environment as we hiked. While a popular hike, since there is limited access due to the parking, the trail is not crowded at all. Definitely bring bear spray (as you should wherever you are hiking in Grand Teton!), but we didn't see any. There are other trails that shoot off of this main one if you wish to go farther and to be more alone. Plan to stay a couple of hours at least. There is a wonderful information center that has a meditation room where you can sit quietly after your hike. Such a lovely find!"

The ladies in the Laurence Rockefeller parking lot were very helpful. They run a very organized parking lot, but try to get there early, because parking is limited. They answered all my questions right there since we were all eager to get on the trail. My family loves the water, so our focus was to go to Phelps Cliff Rock to jump in the water. However, the hike over to the rock was wonderful, too many beautiful vistas to count. The jumping rock is a popular attraction, but not overcrowded when we were there. The water was cold, I was told by park people between 55 and 60 degrees, but it was so clear and beautiful we all had to go in. My two sons loved jumping off the rock while my wife and daughter enjoyed swimming and floating in the water. We were warned there might be leeches, but we never saw any. Not many bugs or mosquitos either. I had to try the jump myself, just to say I did it and then spent time just floating in the lake with my wife and my daughter took some great panorama photos from the shore. On the hike back we sat on a bench to rest and a park guide came over and gave us a great little description of the history of the property and showed us pictures of the lodge and other buildings that stood on the property when Rockefeller owned it. We spent a great day at Phelps Lake! Highly recommended"
102,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2018 , Family,"York, PA ",Great Hiking Trails,"One of the better hikes in and around Jackson and Grand Teton National Park. The number of people who can access the trail is limited by the parking lot, so it keeps the crowd to a minimum. Trails are well marked. Beautiful lake with some great picture taking opportunities. There are some places you can swim in the lake, and more adventurous types were jumping off some rocks."
103,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Kansas City, MO ",Beautiful hike,We hiked up the Woodland Trail to the lake and then took the Lake Creek Trail down. Easy to moderate hike and would recommend. Good hike for early morning. Note that the parking lot fills up incredibly fast.

It was a beautiful building with bathrooms but the parking is horrible. We had to wait 45 minutes at 11:00am to park. Several rangers were there to help assist with waiting and parking - I think they should make more parking in the fields surrounding the parking lot. I bet there are not more than 30 slots.
105,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2018 , Family,"Springfield, MO ",Hike to Phelps Lake,"Several locals recommended the hike to Phelps Lake in the Laurance Rockefeller Preserve. It's a three-mile round trip hike to a beautiful, pristine mountain lake. You can hike around the lake for another 2-3 miles. Hiking on beyond the lake, which looked rather strenuous, takes you to Death Canyon which reportedly has a twenty-foot jump into a pool. We did not do that hike. The hike to Phelps Lake is an easy hike and very enjoyable."

Parking is very limited - we arrived at noon, and had to wait about 40 minutes for a parking spot. The Rangers made the wait worthwhile - they were engaging and would talk to the cars waiting in line the entire time, sharing their knowledge, answering questions, making recommendations. My daughter completed her junior ranger program at the Rockefeller Visitor Center, and the ranger was fantastic. Very engaging, and complimentary of her answers. I am so impressed by all of the rangers at the National Parks - they all clearly love what they do."

The park rangers are extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and nice! They have a junior ranger program in the welcome center. Just ask to sign out a hiking pack for your kiddo, and it comes with binoculars, flora/fauna identification pages, magnifying glass, and other cool tools for exploring. She had an absolute blast.

Sitting on a rock at the edge of the lake, contemplating God's creation in the relative quiet, is a wonderful experience. Hiking over to the jumping rock to watch people gather their courage for the plunge was lots of fun! I would recommend taking one trail to the lake and the other back to the parking lot - so different! Also, if you don't get a parking spot early, lunchtime is a great time for parking to open up. We only waited about 30 minutes. The park rangers here are terrific as well."

123,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2018 , Family,"Hancock, MI ",Hiked around the lake,Go early - or late - because the parking lot fills up quickly. Bring bear spray. We did a big loop hike around the lake. We started out spending an hour or more in the visitor center because a massive thunderstorm hit just as we got there. Lightning/hail/rain - the whole deal. That gave us a chance to learn more about the place and how it came to be part of the park. I spent the rest of the trip wondering exactly where all of the old buildings are now - they were really beautiful and books in the visitor center have all the architectural information. On the hike - once we got past the southern shore of the lake - we hardly saw anyone. It's a flat trail for the most part so it is an easier hike than many in the area.

If you're not there VERY early, or VERY late, you won't be able to see it, got into the center, or find a place to park."
146,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2017 , Family,"Wyoming, ",Beautiful Family Friendly Atmosphere,"First, I would like to thank the Preserve for only allowing a certain number of people into this place throughout the day (well cars anyway). We only had to wait about an hour to park, but it was worth it. The visitor's center alone was worth it. Our children loved every part of it, including the sound sensory room where they tried to identify the sounds of the nature. The rangers were very good with all the kids and had small discussions with them and importance of listening and exploring in and outside the center.    As for the hikes, they rented out explorer backpacks for each family that included individual journals, animal identification charts (by footprints, droppings, or physically), binoculars, etc. The trail maps had so many options for all ages to conquer. You could take a short stroll to the waterfalls, or hike further to the breathtaking Phelps Lake. We combined a couple of trails and made it all the way to the lake with the kids with no problems. I know that many bears are spotted in this preserve in the early mornings, which is also the best time to get there to beat the waiting in line and the heat of the day. I would highly recommend this place either way."

Rockefeller Preserve is a refuge within the Grand Teton NP and is operated by the NPS. The preserve is located on the scenic Moose-Wilson Road, which is closed to RV's and trailers. It has a visitor centre, which is open between 9am and 5pm in the summer. There are 8 mi/12.8 km of trails leading to Phelps Lake, as well as a 4.1 mi/6.6 km trail around Phelps Lake. Parking at the preserve is limited.    We visited the preserve around 2:30 pm on a Tuesday in August and were lucky enough to find the last available parking spot. The park rangers here were super friendly, helpful and welcoming. We did the Lake Creek-Woodlands Trail Loop combined with the Phelps Lake Trail Loop (hike from the preserve centre along Lake Creek to the shores of Phelps Lake, hike the full loop of Phelps Lake in a clockwise direction, and return to the preserve centre). It took us roughly 4 hours to hike the 6.3 mi/10.1 km trail. The trail condition was excellent. We loved the views of the Teton Range from Phelps Lake, especially of Death Canyon from the southern shore. There is even a nice swimmable beach near the Phelps Lake Campground. You can easily spend a whole day here."

The only problem: the route had been changed due to work at the Preserve and our route increased to about 4.5 miles; clearly the work had begun sometime earlier in the year and we were very surprised that the National Park Service staff in Moose was not up-to-date on the re-routing. Even so, the hike was nice, a few challenging climbs, well marked for the most part (we were unsure at a couple of spots where to go), and revealed some beautiful sights. Also, the updated maps were not available when we began the hike (around 9:30am) but were out around noon when we returned. The Preserve's headquarters were closed so we are not able to comment on it."

Our guide's van could take the pot holes (The Rockefellers gave the park land to the Park Service and public but only with the provision that the land and roads be NOT improved....so the dirt roads are and remain in horrible condition).

We had to use an alternate path to start, but then we used the Creekside trail to the lake. We did not hike the entire lake, but we got to Huckleberry Point. On the way back we took the Woodlands Trail, a beautiful and scenic route. My husband saw a golden colored fox (I missed it) and we did see fresh bear scat. We did not carry bear spray, but many people we bumped into did. I did carry a bear bell. Hike was fairly easy, but we did rack up 5.5 miles round trip. The view of the Tetons along the way and at the lake was stunning. Parking is limited, but we only waited 15 minutes as this is not high season. I do recommend this stop!"
162,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Charlotte, NC ",Peaceful hike with a beautiful reward!,"We hiked up the woodland trail to Phelps lake and back down the Lake Creek trail to the visitors center. What a beautiful way to spend a few hours on a beautiful day in the Tetons! You can't beat this hike. It did have some changes in elevation, but they were easy to handle and not strenuous. The lake is beautiful and definitely the centerpiece of this trail. I would definitely carry bear spray here - bears are known to frequent the area and the rangers were actually surprised when we didn't see any on our 4 mile loop! We did hear the elk bugling, which was an experience in and of itself. Definitely make this trail a priority on your trip to the Tetons."

The hike to Phelps lake and back is 4 miles, an easy to moderate hike. Make sure you stop at the visitor center - well done, and will take just a few minutes. We took the path along the creek to the lake and came back on the Woodlands trail. In all, the hike took just over 2 hours with a stop to view the incredible scenery at the lake - precisely the view Laurence Rockefeller had from his house. Get there early, and you might see wildlife on the way to the trail - at an overlook along the way. Parking is restricted (and you have to park in the parking lot), so if you arrive later in the day be prepared to wait in your car for a parking place - no cheating since they have volunteers monitoring the parking lot."

The preserve is clean and very well taken care of. The visitor center is a very green building and the displays presented are beautiful. They also have a library in the building. The hiking path is well maintained and the lake is beautiful. There was a man in a wheelchair who was able to get around to the visitors center and was told the paths were going to be improved to be more accessible.

My favorite is along the creek. We also have done the Woodlands trail. When you get to the lake you can walk all the way around it. If you go to the right about a mile, there is a huge rock people were jumping off. My husband an a friend jumped. The water was cold but they had fun."

184,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Lancaster, PA ",Hike to Phelps Lake Well Worth the Effort !,"Although we really had never heard of this place we stopped on our way through the Grand Tetons. The visitor center is mostly a library reference room, but the trails are just beautiful. We hiked the Woodland Trail to Phelps Lake and could not believe the view. The trail goes up and down, and is narrow in points when you have to pass hikers going the opposite way. It is largely wooded, so cool and out of the sun. Although you cross a highway, we never saw traffic either going to or returning from the lake.    Lucky for us we did not encounter any wildlife -- it was only later we heard from the rangers that you should not hike without bear spray. Make sure to travel in groups and make noise so you don't sneak up on the bears. That part we thankfully knew.    The only issue I have with this preserve is parking. We arrived in the early afternoon after the parking lot was filled. You must sit in line and wait for a space to open up. You are not allowed to park alongside the road or lot, and there are rangers there to make sure you do not break the rules. Get there early if possible !"
185,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Poughkeepsie, NY ",THE best place in all of Grand Teton NP - don't miss it!,"A group of friends and I recently spent 2 glorious weeks in Grand Teton National Park, primarily traveling there to witness the Aug 21 solar eclipse in totality but also to spend time in GTNP and Yellowstone. We were lucky enough to secure cabins in the park for the entire time, so we hiked, fished, ran rivers, and enjoyed the amazing scenery as much as possible. Hands down, our favorite place in both parks was the Laurance S Rockefeller Nature Preserve in the southern end of GTNP.  Mr. Rockefeller, the brother of Nelson and son of JD, originally owned a large ranch, the JY, in this area, and amassed additional surrounding land as he was able to do so. Being the great philanthropist he was, he eventually donated all of it to GTNP so it could be preserved and enjoyed by future generations. Preserved and enjoyed it has been! The land itself is gorgeous, but the preserve buildings, restrooms, and even the water fountains were constructed with thought of the environment and placed in such a way as to enhance the natural surroundings, not detract from them.  There are many options for hiking, from short and easy to long with significant elevation climbs. We opted for a middle-of-the-road hike, about a 5-mile loop, skirting Phelps Lake. The abundance of waterfalls, exotic wildflowers, and lake/mountain reflections to which we were treated made for an outstanding morning. The best surprise was regularly-placed restrooms with composting toilets (no smell!) and running water. In my opinion, the LSR Preserve should win the most beautiful restrooms award (if there is such a thing)!  Birds and wildlife were also abundant as we spotted a moose family with twin babies (a rarity, according to the rangers), a kingfisher diving into the lake and pulling out a fish, bald eagles, and a huge osprey guarding her gigantic nest.  The interpretive wing of the visitor's center is an amazing treat. 4 video screens play looping wildlife and nature footage with actual sound effects and a wall of collages could keep kids occupied for hours. If ever there was a great place to meditate or find serenity, this is it. The desk is serviced by an interpretive park ranger during all open hours (usually 8-5), and she can provide great suggestions for walks and hikes.  All in all, the LSR Preserve is almost perfect. The only downside might be having only 48 parking spaces. If you don't get there early (gates open at 6:30 AM), you will wait in line for someone to leave. In a way this is a good thing as it keeps the trails from becoming overrun with hikers. So get up early, see the Grand Tetons morning and wildlife, and get to the Laurance S Rockefeller Nature Preserve. You will be enchanted!"

The hike around Phelps Lake is spectacular. There are some hikers, which is good to keep the bears aware, but nothing like anywhere else in the park. If you want peace and quiet this is the trail for you. Make sure you hike COUNTER clockwise around the lake as the views of the Tetons are much better that way.  We took our time and also went swimming. Pack your suit as by August the lake is not that cold and it was SO refreshing and relaxing on a hot day.  Please don't skip the visitor center. I've never been to anything like it. Zen! A perfect way to end your hike. It really captures the spirit of the place. And what a beautiful place. Skip Jenny Lake and come here.

This reserve was donated by Rockafeller and is simply stunning in its natural beauty with crystal clear rivers and wonderful walking paths. At this time of year you may see bear or moose. If you have time walk the whole lake. Visit the visitors centre. I would suggest going early- we started at 630am and had it all to ourselves. Take bear spray. It was a reality elder to be here.

The hiking crowd is regulated by several rangers who supervise the parking lot assuring that no one parks illegally. When the lot fills up they start a queue, it took me 25 minutes to obtain a spot. As soon as a spot opens up they graciously direct you into your spot.  Phelps Lake hike was very nice and relatively easy. surprisingly i was able to get ATT cell seevice with 4GLte in the parking lot. First time in 2 weeks.  Unfortunately I finished the hike after 5PM and the museum was closed."

There is an intriging visitors center and hiking trails up to a nearby lake (1.5 miles each way to the lake, 10 miles total to circle the lake). However, either get there by 9:15 am, or expect a lengthy wait. There are only 50 parking spaces and day hikers take many of them.

The hiking trail was easy, well kept, and enjoyable. The view at the end was beautiful and we saw some great birds. If you can go in the morning before the rush for parking then I'd do it!"

We were not disappointed! We were late to arrive (3pm) and did have to wait about 15 min for a spot (we were first in line...several cars came in behind us), but the ranger there was friendly and helped us pass the time by talking to the kids and making recommendations. The visitor center is very nice with lots of good information. There was a ranger talk starting about 30 min after our arrival, which sounded awesome, but we decided to skip to start hiking. It is a beautiful hike out to the lake, and not long at all (I think it was ~3 miles round trip). There was another ranger at the top overlooking the lake to talk to and learn from. The paths are clearly marked, and there are maps to take at the beginning of the trail. There are beautiful waterfalls and bridges. It really was a very nice hike that can be done in a short amount of time."

225,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Sedona, AZ ",Nice Hike and Beautiful Visitor Center,Best tip on this is to arrive early - we were there by 8 AM - no problems parking - when we left they were waiting in line to park - would much rather enjoy our time hiking then waiting in the car to park even if it means getting up super early! The hike itself was awesome especially early when you are the only ones on the trail! Fairly easy with minimal incline - gorgeous views of the Tetons reflect on the lake in the AM
226,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2017 , Family,"Greenwich, CT ",The best hike!,"I was very impressed by the visitor center as well as the innovative way the trails were constructed. We walked over a marsh area on a metal walkway so you could see the frogs and tadpoles easily in the water below. The Rangers were extremely friendly and helpful. If you have a child under 13, be sure to check out a backpack at the front desk. It has binoculars and many laminated field guides for plants and animals . we used identifying the many animals we saw. Including a brown bear that ran right by us on the path around Phelps Lake. A beautiful and easy hike for families."
227,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2017 , Family,New York ,Beautiful Hike to Phelps Lake,"Perfect for beginner families or young children.

228,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2017 , Solo,"Pittston, PA ",Heart of the Park,"For me, the quiet paths of the Laurance Rockefeller Preserve are inspirational.

The cascading creek from the lake is beautiful and makes for a scenic walk all the way up. Once you get to the lake, and see the Grand Tetons it is even better. This is a fairly easy hike with some rocks, and gradual elevation gain."
232,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Jersey City, NJ ",Beautiful visitor center. Crowded trail around lake.,"Like every Rockefeller preserve I visited, this is lovingly maintained and and enjoyable, perfectly-chosen piece of land. The hike around the lake is most popular, and it might be nicer if they closed the parking lot at a certain point to let more people enjoy it in peace (there are lots of families with kids romping through here and it felt a little like an amusement park; whereas, if they paced the visitors out a little, it would give one the sense of quiet nature, in which the Laurence Rockefeller was so keenly aware of providing.) The property is worth visiting regardless, the hikes are easy, the waterfall and river are inspiring, and the staff are delightful and helpful."
233,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Fredericksburg, VA ","Hidden gem, worth the wait to park","This is a really special, unique place right next (in?) Grand Teton National Park. Located up the Moose Wilson Road, it is a beautiful and well thought out nature preserve, designed to allow visitors to really reflect on the beauty of nature and it's serenity. Rockefeller left the property to the park with specific instructions on how it was to be developed. This includes a limit of 50 parking spots so it is never over crowded. Well maintained nature trails, and a really top notch visitor center."
234,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2017 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Worth the wait for parking!,"The parking lot for this area fills up fast and very early in the morning. If the parking lot is full, the park rangers will line you up and you'll have to wait with your car until a parking spot becomes available. My family waited about 40 minutes, but it was definitely worth the wait. Great easy hike to the beautiful Phelps Lake. The entire reserve is lovely."
235,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2017 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Great hike around Phelps Lake,"Our family spent a day hiking around Phelps Lake. It was 6.8 miles round trip, which was a pretty long way but doable for our kids (12, 11, 7). The trail is very well maintained, easy to follow, and provides great views of the lake and surrounding mountains. The visitor center is also worth a quick peek. I recommend starting early because by the time we returned (early afternoon) there was a line for parking. When we arrived (early morning) we pulled right in and started hiking. Overall, its a really nice way to spend a day in the Tetons."

Beautiful lake views reward you...no animal encounters , but maybe it was a quiet time of day (10:30)..the parking lot was nearly full when we arrived, and there was a wait when we departed...so go early!  The inside of the building had aome interesting exhibits and information about the property and the Rockefeller family.  Very enjoyable. ...trail was rockier and rootier than we expected...some up and down...big rocks for kids to climb up on along the trail....pretty wildflowers."

It has this really cool 3D map and beautiful photos. The trail itself is a really easy hike alongside a river which is beautiful. It's mostly shaded and we saw tons of wildlife. There was apparently a mama bear with some cubs nearby. We did not see her but did see moose and mule deer as well as lots of birds. Definitely recommend it!

Definitely get there very early so you can get a parking space as they are limited. The hike into Phelps Lake is beautiful and an easy walk for families. The lake itself is well worth the hike. It is about a 3 mile loop. We saw a beaver, deer, and a moose, but luckily we never encountered bears. I highly recommend a visit to the Preserve!"
244,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Sturbridge, MA ",Great spot for an easy hike - hidden gem!,"We visited the Preserve while on our trip to GTNP in July. We took the trail along Lake Creek to Phelps Lake. It was a non-strenuous hike through a very scenic area. The lake is a beautiful shade of turquoise blue, framed by mountains behind it. Bring water with you, and wear comfortable shoes, as the hike itself will take over an hour. You will see some wildlife while on this hike - a deer walked directly across our path on the back side of this trail, close enough that we could have reached out and touched her (do not do this). We were also warned in advance that a bear had been spotted along the trail slightly further up, but was gone by the time we arrived in that area. There are restrooms in the Visitor Center. Parking is limited, so arrive early if possible. The rangers will only allow in as many cars as there is parking, so during busy hours, there is a line of cars waiting to get in. We waited for about 20 minutes, but it was worth it. This park is in a more remote area of Teton, and we did come across a moose on the way in (which this area is known for!). Highly recommend!"

On that day the center and bathrooms were closed but the trails were open.    We walked the Woodland trail, about a mile, to the lake and the Lake Creek trail, about 1.3 miles, back. The Woodland trail still had lots of snow and ice on it. Also there were several trees down on it. However, the Lake Creek trail was in much better shape. We enjoyed it much more. We did hike some on the trail around Phelps lake!    The views of the Grand Tetons, the lake and creek are wonderful."

Each time I arrive I'm greeted by an annoying, nosey usually older/ bored retired person. They grill you about what your doing there, what your plans are for the day, what color underwear you have on, and how many times you've had sex. They stop you to chat and create a long long line to park. It's annoying and unnecessary in my opinion. It's a national park, let the citizens of our nation visit the park without feeling like the CIA is interrogating us."

There are a few trails to choose from depending on how far you want to go. Bring your lunch and eat on a rock by the lake. Unfortunately the visitors center was closed for the season, but still worth the stop to enjoy nature and the view. Has a fairly large parking lot and bathrooms."

An interesting design with space to meditate, you find peace even before you head out to the preserve. It is well worth the walk to the lake for wonderful scenery and wildlife.  The staff is very helpful, I took a photo of a bird which we could not identify, they enlisted a few ""experts"" on hand to help figure out what bird it was.  The only draw back is that they ( along with other sites) do not allow guides to go with visitors. We were on a National Geographic trip and were used to have experts to answer our questions as well as lead us to the best spots."

271,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Burbank, WA ",Nice launch point for hiking and history,"This area of the Teton Park is quite unique. There is an interesting, although not large, visitor center with a variety of exhibits. An interesting video collage is fascinating to watch and learning about the history of how the land became part of the park as a bequest from the Rockefeller family is great to know.    The Center is probably best used as a launch point for hikes into the Tetons. The short hike to Phelps lake above the Center is nice and can be a great way to introduce kids to the wonder of nature. Beyond the lake you can go deeper into the Tetons and actually hike into Death Canyon and elsewhere and come out at other trail heads.    The one thing that you should know is that there is limited parking at the Center's parking lot. This is by design to control the number of hikers and visitors to the area. If you arrive early you're likely to get a parking spot without the wait. Later in the morning and through the day you will have to wait in line until there is an opening when someone leaves the parking lot.    It's a beautiful area that is worth the wait, if you have the time and patience needed."

277,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Englewood, CO ",Fun pretty hike,"If you want a simple, easy, short, but very beautiful hike, go to LRP. You can add on to your hike to make it longer, or just go a short way, so it appeals to many different people. The only negative is that parking is not plenteous, and it is strictly regulated by the rangers. You have to line up for spaces and when a spot is vacated, the first car in line gets the spot. I'm not sure if they don't allow motor homes, so check this out first before going. The drive there is quite lovely as well. When we were there the leaves were starting to turn, so it was gorgeous. Because it's a fairly flat, well maintained trail, you can actually look around while you hike instead of watching where you walk! While we waited in line to get a spot, we took turns going through the visitor center which is a really interesting building, but has very little of interest inside. The lake is spectacular and the fact it is such an accessible hike everyone should take a little time to hike a short little hike, or add a bit of mileage to make it a bit longer. I've heard if you go early you can get parking easier. We also noticed there was no line for a spot as it got later in the afternoon. We went around lunch time, so there were about 8 cars ahead. We only had to wait about 20 minutes, so don't let the line discourage you."

Pretty lake, level walking for the most part with several prominences to reflect on the sun dappled waves.    he park service is reviewing access to that area due to the narrow Moose Wilson road and restricted parking: get there early.

286,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2016 , Family,"Evansville, IN ",Pretty hike and lake,"We learned that they intentionally made the parking lot small to limit the amount of visitors at a given time and help you enjoy your hike in solitude. When we arrived around 10:30 we had about a 30 minute wait for a parking spot. So I took the kids to check out the visitor center (they have activity books specific to the preserve as well as the Jr. ranger program) while my husband made sandwiches from the back of the van and waited.  It was a very doable hike--a ranger advised us to go left first (it is a loop), as it is a more gradual incline. We ran into two groups who had spotted black bears in different locations. We only saw 3 mule deer (and of course chipmunks), but have your bear spray handy! At the top, Phelps Lake has several small trails out to more secluded spots. It worked well for us to picnic there. It took us 3 hours including hanging out at the lake for a bit.  State of the art pit toilets are remarkable!"

It's getting tougher to spot moose in the park, so this was really special.    When we arrived at the Preserve a friendly ranger have us the lay of the land and invited us to have our picnic lunch on the veranda of the visiting center or pack it carefully and hike 1.5 miles to Phelps Lake and find a spot to eat there. We decided to eat on the veranda, put our food away so as not to attract the many bears in the park, and then set off for our hike. The hike that followed a winding river had a slight incline at times, but it was manageable for my kids and my husband's 76 year-old father with beautiful scenery. Once at the lake, we tipped our feet in the water and rested on big rocks and generous log benches provided. The hike back was easier, mostly downhill.    There were many places to sit and rest and enjoy the view and restroom near the lake. It was really lovely and serene. Back at the welcoming center we visited the sound exhibit that showed videos of the wildlife in the park accompanied by sound. I could have sat there all day. A perfect way to spend a day in the Tetons."

A very beautiful Visitor's Center, clean toilet facilities and an extensive series of hiking trails. The hike to the Lake is about a mile and rewards you with lovely views.  They have various water-themed locales set up in the park which kids (and even adults) will enjoy playing in - unlike most of the Park swimming is encouraged.

It's an easy hike (not a lot of elevation gain) and the views of the Lake/Mountains are gorgeous! The water on Phelps Lake was so still and the reflection of the mountains was beautiful. On the north end of the lake we saw a momma moose and her baby and on the west end of the lake we saw a black bear. A little bit further down, we saw a fox. And of course, tons of chipmunks. Great views, wonderful trails, totally recommend it. It's about a 7 mile hook and took us about 3.5 hours. That's mostly because we stopped and took photos so often and because we stopped when we saw the animals to make sure nothing was going to happen!"
314,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2016 , Friends,"Martinsburg, WV ",Amazing Place!,Spent several hours here with elderly relatives who have mobility issues. They had no trouble getting from parking lot to the visitors center and then down a short path to the waterfalls. Be prepared - parking lot only allows for 50 cars. If it is full you have to wait until a spot opens up. This kept the crowds down. Visitors venter was very interesting.
315,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Aug 2016 , Family,"Tampa, FL, ",Best part of Grand Teton National Park,"For our family of five (mom, dad, 11-year-old, 8-year-old, and 4-year-old), we entered Grand Teton National Park from the South, through the Granite Canyon entrance.  We had heard that the LSR preserve and Phelps Lake were awesome and so wanted to be sure to hit them, but we didn't really understand the relationship between the two. After having visited, I now understand that Phelps Lake is located within the LSR Preserve, and there are really only 2 ways to get to Phelps Lake: (1) Park in the LSR Preserve visitors center parking lot and hike up to Phelps Lake (about 1.2 miles each way); or (2) Park at the Death Canyon trailhead and hike to Phelps Lake from there (not sure how far that is, but I think it's considerably longer than the first option). The trick is that while option (1) is ideal for families like ours with small kids, there is limited access to the LSR visitors center via car, and so you need to get there early or be willing to wait for a parking spot to open up.  The LSR preserve is not well marked off the main road (just a simple wood arch, with a small sign that reads ""LSR Preserve""), and so it's easy to drive past it. We would later learn that the non-descript signage is intentional because there is limited access to the LSR preserve area, including the visitors center. Apparently when John Rockefeller Jr. donated a bunch of land to the park, his son (Laurence) convinced him to not donate this 1100 acres; but then many years later, when Laurence was in his 80s or 90s (2003, I think), Laurence decided it was now time to donate these 1100 acres as well. One of the conditions of the donation, however, was that only a limited number of cars could park in the LSR preserve area, thereby restricting the number of people who can visit at a time and keeping the experience from becoming overcrowded. While this is slightly annoying if you get there and the parking lot is filled up, it sure makes for an enjoyable experience once you are able to get a parking spot. In fact, visiting the LSR preserve (including Phelps Lake) was the highlight of our visit to GTNP.  We arrived a little bit later than we wanted at the LSR preserve parking lot (around 10.15am), and so we had to wait about 30-40 minutes for a parking spot to open. The parking lot volunteers are very well organized, as they tell you where to pull over while waiting for a spot, and they are pleasant to talk to while you wait. Many cars who pulled in and found out the wait would be 30 minutes (or more) simply left rather than wait for a spot. It worked out that my wife could take the 3 kids up to the Visitor Center (.2 mile walk) while I waited with the car for a parking spot to open up.  My wife and the kids joined an informational ranger for a guided walk up to the visitors center from the parking lot (about a 5 minute walk), and my wife said it was truly excellent. She learned about the history of the LSR preserve, etc. She then spent about 30 minutes in the visitors center (while waiting for me to get a parking spot), and she said it was one of the best visitors centers she's been in. It wasn't a typical kid-friendly visitors center, but instead had a great library, etc.  When we were finally ready to hike up to Phelps Lake, my kids checked out a junior rancher backpack, which included binoculars, magnifying glass, and some laminated guides to the local animals, plants, scat, etc. I find that these junior ranger backpack things are not that great, but we did get good use out of the laminated plant/tree guide.  The recommended hike to Phelps Lake for kids is to take the Lake Creek trail up and then the Woodland trail down; this is because the Woodland trail is much steeper, and so even though it is a little shorter (1.1 miles vs. 1.4 miles), it's tougher for kids to hike up the Woodland Trail. The hike up the Lake Creek Trail was very enjoyable and took us about 1.5 hours. We encountered literally only 3 or 4 other groups the entire time on the Lake Creek Trail. Once at the top, the view of Phelps Lake is phenomenal. We even saw a deer eating at the top, even though it was mid-day. There are bathrooms located at Phelps Lake.  At the top, we swam in Phelps Lake for a bit, which is tricky not just because the water is cold, but also because the shoreline is covered with rocks, which are slippery and (at least some) are pointy. We had found a decent place to enter the lake that was about .1 or .2 miles from where Lake Creek Trail spits you out at Phelps Lake, but we still had to deal with the rocks. We perservered, though, and waded out into the lake far enough that we found a sandy bottom, and we truly enjoyed our mountain lake swim. (We brought our swim suits in our backpack, but decided against bringing towels or swim shoes; it was a good move to not bring towels, as they would have been heavy and unncessary, as we dried pretty quickly once we got out of the water, but I can't help but wonder if the experience would have been more enjoyable with swim shoes; I'm just not sure if the shoes would have solved the problem of the slippery rocks.) We spent about 30-45 minutes swimming in the lake, and it was awesome.  We hiked back down from Phelps Lake via the Woodland Trail, and it probably took us 1 hour. All told, we spent about 3 hours hiking/enjoying Phelps Lake, plus another 30-40 minutes on the front end waiting for a parking spot. That was much longer than we had anticipated spending there, but we loved it so much (mostly due to the lack of crowds, but also because of the beautiful views) that we decided it was worth it to stay longer.  If you don't have kids and are more of a hiker, it might make sense to park at the Death Canyon trailhead and hike in.  Also, note that the Lake Creek/Woodland trails spit you out at the south end of Phelps Lake. You can then hike around Phelps Lake for as much as you want, but I understand it is 6 miles or so to hike the entire lake. You'll probably see more wildlife if you hike away from the south side (where the Lake Creek/Woodland Trails are), and I think you'll also encounter Jump Rock (apparently a rock that is about 25-30 feet above Phelps Lake from which you can jump into the lake) if you hike all the way around to the North side of Phelps Lake. I think it might be easier to access Jump Rock if you hike in on the Death Canyon trailhead, which spits you out at the north end of Phelps Lake.  The deadline for returning the junior ranger backpack is 4.30pm, so plan accordingly."

Not wanting to sit in a hot car that long, we left without seeing anything.    We heard that this is a new facility, which is shocking that they deliberately built an inadequate parking lot. The park rangers giggled with glee when they told us how long many people had to wait, as if this was a Disney Theme Park. There was room on the side of the lot for at least 20 more cars, yet parking is forbidden there. It seemed like the rangers were enjoying a power-play making dumb tourists like us wait to go to a visitors center and a short hike.    Don't go here unless you arrive very early!"
325,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2016 , Family,"Elkhart, IN ",Rockefeller Monopoly at its finest!!!,"This land was donated by Rockefeller with the intent for it to be shared with everyone.....using a parking lot of about 50 spaces. You'll need the advice below to help enjoy your visit as we did. I would rate it more stars if the NPS builds more parking and puts in some garbage cans.    ADVICE:  --Arrive by 8:30-9:00 for parking spot  --Handicap sticker or license plate will allow you to bypass everyone waiting in line. The 2 handicap spots sat empty much of the day  --Bring your swim suit for warm summer day  --A must for teenagers. They can jump into the lake from the top of a 20-25 ft rock (the Rangers do not promote this with much excitement, but ask any kid who has done it and they'll smile ear to ear while telling you about it)  --The trails and Lake Phelps are refreshing  --Visitor center is minimalist design  --NO GARBAGE CANS ANYWHERE. Pack in & pack out. This includes your child's diapers! (there's small receptacles for feminine hygiene products).  --Bathrooms conveniently located at parking lot, visitor center, and near Phelps Lake  --Drink the Kool-Aide. Rockefeller name is clearly displayed and repeated by the Rangers and NPS employees as if there's a quota in their employment contract. We asked the NPS employee leading our guided hike and she said yes she is required to mention the Rockefeller name. The employees do not mention and nowhere at the preserve is it stated that the Rockefeller family empire was built from a foundation of exploration and exploitation of the fossil fuel industry, most notably, oil.    I agree it's nice gesture for Laurance to donate his land, but pan out for the full perspective. He was in his 90s. He no longer had any use for the land with his kids. In addition, he felt it was important to donate with advertising of plastering his name everywhere. There's plenty of wealthy Americans who donate with much less fanfare and self-promotion.    HISTORY REFRESHER:  Laurance's grandfather accumulated an incredible amount of wealth by obliterating the competition in order to dominate the fossil fuel industry with his company Standard Oil. Per Wikipedia: By 1880, according to the New York World, Standard Oil was ""the most cruel, impudent, pitiless, and grasping monopoly that ever fastened upon a country""  Later in life his grandpa made charitable contributions to society. However, most of the real estate and money remain with the family as generations of Rockefellers live with more money than they know what to do with."

We were so impressed with the Preserve we took our children and grandchildren back when they arrived a few days later. The hike up Lake Creek Trail was lovely and the aroma of the spruce forest was delightful. Our entire family of 11 were sworn in as Junior Rangers for Grand Teton National Park at the Preserve. Two ten year old granddaughters loved the backpack program and activity books available for families. At peak times be sure to arrive before 10 am or after 3 pm, as the parking lot only holds 50 cars and fills up fast."

We have been to this preserve to do the Phelps Lake hike a few times before, so this time we decided to do the ranger-led tour, Exploring the Preserve.    We booked the hike in advance, through Grand Teton NP. We arrived to the preserve about 10 mins before the hike started, and were dismayed to find that the parking lot was already full. It was designed to limit the number of people in the preserve, and can only hold 30-40 cars. If you are going with a group, it is best to take the least amount of cars possible. Because one person in the group still needed to stay with the car to park it, the rest of our group went to the main visitor center to meet for the hike.    The Explore the Preserve ranger program was informative about the different animals that lived in the area (bear, wolf, and osprey) and their relationships with early and modern humans. It was a long duration program, about 2-3 hours for 1.5 miles of path. This program was enjoyable for teens, but could also be interesting for adults or elementary age children.    As for the actual path, the hike up to Phelps Lake can be taken as a loop, or there-and-back path. The trails are rocky, but still very manageable for anyone who is mobile. The path can get narrow, and a bit hilly, but not very steep. It is rated as an easy hike, and the reward of the lake at the end is nice.    If you were to not do the ranger-led hike, you can walk up to the lake and back in about an hour.    There is no entrance fee to the preserve.    This is a great stop for anyone in Grand Tetons!"

The wildflowers are beautiful. the last time were we there, the streams were very fast moving because of the snow melt, & the sounds of the water were incredible.There are activities & daily programs. You can hike yourself or go with a ranger. There are short strolls, or longer hikes. You don’t have to walk very far to see a waterfall. The visitor center is outstanding. The resource room has information on the area. If you still have questions, there is staff there to help. There is a fireplace that is lovely. We like to sit outside on the porch and relax.

Similarly Members of the local historic preservation movement were sad at the proposed movement of structures from the first guest ranch in Jackson Hole, the 1908 JY ranch, causing them to lose their in situ integrity. But Mr. L had a vision resulting in the entire region being returned to its undeveloped state.  With the construction of a visitor center, you might imagine a little bit of self congratulation on the Rockefellers part might be evident. But rather than that, the modest displays instead speak of the immediate region's impact upon all people. A moving poem by Terry Tempest Williams requires traversing the whole building to read. A circular meditation room with the sounds of the woods surrounding you allows you to experience the wealth of the area in an economical time. thousands of photographs of plants, animals and birds resolve to form a mosaic view of the lake and canyon when the viewer backs away from it. A 3-D relief map of the mouth of death Canyon invites you to explore further, along with handout maps to guide you on the easy to long nature trails. Finally, a reading room stocked with the works of leading local and global naturalists and conservationists is a priceless treasure for the curious of heart to discover with joy."

We had come prepared to hike so took the Lake Creek Trail to get to the Lake and the Woodlands Trail to get back to the parking lot. Both trails were wide, scenic, moderate in climb and rewarding. All in all approximately two and a half miles total through a variety of woodland environments and tree types. The view across Phelps Lake toward Death Canyon is outstanding.

Follow the trail clockwise and about 3/4 of the way around, there's a huge rock with about a 30-foot drop into the lake. Safe for jumping—our guys loved it. There's also a little beach less than 1/4 mile before the rock.    *** Of special note here is the visitor center, which is unlike any NPS visitor center I've ever been through. It's very much a quiet, meditative place, where one can ponder in gratitude the love of nature that prompted Rockefeller to ensure that these acres would be restored to their natural state and preserved for generations to come.

But once you're in the parking lot, there is a nice restroom which does NOT stink yet is very green. Then you walk a very short way to the center. Inside, a giant fireplace warms you as you listen to a docent give a short talk. This one was about how animals stay alive in the winter. I learned that bears actually use everything in their digestive and excretory systems while they are hibernating. Then a young bear came to feed on the chokeberries around the building. Then we came back inside and enjoyed the video loops of the preserve in all seasons. There are quotes from Rockefeller on the walls that give you a chance to pause and think. I really enjoyed the sound room - an almost acoustically perfect area to listen to the sounds of nature and rest your eyes from the overload on that sense. Great coffe-table books everywhere near the fire. Loved it!"

Of the 40 national parks we've visited, the Jackson Hole area of Wyoming has the place dearest to my family's hearts. This preserve gives you the chance to see moose, black and brown bears, elk, and lots of dear. If you've never spent a quiet moment in the woods and heard elk bugle then this is a perfect place to start.

Look for the berry bushes (trees) next to the road that are shaking and it is likely a bear.. .they ended up closing Moose Wilson Road the last day we were there due to increased bear activity close to the road. I highly recommend hiking any of the numerous trails in this area AND carrying bear spray. We saw a total of 4 bears from the road - all black bears. The visitor center is worth the stop... Oh!

They have a small visitors center that is pretty cool. We took the trail to Phelps Lake, which had a lot of scenic views on the way. Once we got to Phelps, we sat on the rocks and took in the sights. After resting for a little bit, we decided to walk the trail around the lake. We got about 20 yards on to the trail when a female Mule Deer scared the crap out of us, by jumping out from behind a boulder along the trail. We walked the rest of the way without animal incident. It was a long hike, and our feet were pretty sore by the end of it, but you had beautiful views of the lake the whole way. I would definitely recommend going."

But the cub was in a berry tree right outside the center so we got some live entertainment. Even had to go inside once the bear crossed the wooden walk. The hike was nice to the lake though we saw no more bears but a few eagles.

Although the park is crowded, we never felt it on the hike or eating lunch at the lake. There is something magical in the air here. It's the Grand Tetons so of course it's beautiful, but there is something some special here. The park has a warning for bear activity. We were fortunate to see an adolescent black bear near the bathrooms adjacent to the visitor center. Give the visitor center a look, there are great books for adults and children. Also, this is not a place to clean out the car. The facility is zero waste and including the composting toilets."

The land was put in a trust and is overseen by Teton park rangers who were wonderfully helpful and friendly. The hike was a moderate one in elevation gain, so that it was a blast for kids and adults alike. Given the altitude - 7600', as a flatlander, there was not too much puffing as we went along. The view at the lake was grand and many streams and other ""walk in the woods"" sights were wonderful. I would highly recommend it. There is an extension around the lake which gives more wonderful views and the Park Ranger Center has interesting exhibits and a room called the ""Sound Room"" which is silent except for forest sounds. It was wonderful. A sudden clap of thunder was a complete surprise."

We walked through the visitor center first, which introduces the meaning of this spectacular setting. We then started the lovely and manageable walk/hike past streams and meadows revealing views that are breathtaking and wildlife galore. As you approach Phelps lake, the trail is on a slight uphill, and when you reach the top, the glorious view of Phelps lake is revealed. You won't believe it is real. Absolutely breathtaking, and to think that this property was so generously donated back to the National Park by Laurance S. Rockefeller so that it could be protected, preserved and shared.

472,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jul 2015 , Couples,Alabama ,Beautiful!,Fairly easy hike to the beautiful Phelps Lake. During July the wildflowers made the area extra beautiful. We had trouble with altitude most of the time but found this hike to be relatively easier.

Our two children participated in the Junior Ranger program and LOVED it!! And so did we.    We hiked, we learned about nature with our quick reference guides that were part of the backpack we took for our hike. The kids took notes in their Ranger journals. We took some great pictures during our walk and our stop by the lake. The scenery was spectacular! We saw a couple of chipmunks on our hike and not many more animals. The hike was around 3 miles total I believe. We took our time and were in no rush. There was opportunity to hike / walk more, but the kids were satisfied with what we accomplished.    Bring bug repellent. Lots of deer / horse flies."

The wait for parking might confuse or turn off some people, but it is so worth it. Not as crowded and bustling as the other popular areas like Jenny Lake because of the limited parking. We loved not seeing other hikers for half an hour at a time- it really made this area special and secluded. This area is a must see for visitors to Grand Teton/Jackson Hole!"

There were several Rangers there just directing parking. we arrived there about 11 o'clock and had to wait in the line about a half hour in order to get a parking place. So, go early or after 4pm.    Once parked, we did the one and a half mile hike to Phelps Lake and it was gorgeous scenery. There are several Rapids, a little waterfall, and some bridges. We did see deer, and another group warned us that they saw a bear cub. Several groups swam in the crystal clear lake.    The actual trail is rugged, ups and downs, with rocks and stones, so watch your step."
485,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2015 , Couples,USA ,Make sure to check out the visitor center!,"We had a great hike to Phelps Lake. We enjoyed the history of the area. Go to the small visitor center to learn about the area's connection to the Rockefellers before your hike. My husband kept pointing out what looked like old roads along our hike. Come to find out after our hike the were indeed old roads, as the Rockefellers had cabins and facilities in the area, and not the long ago! Very interesting and the beauty of the area is something to see."

The trails are clearly marked, and there are several different ways to get to the lake, or go around it if you're looking for a longer hike. The sound room inside is also beautiful. However, if you're looking for a medium to hard hike, this is probably not the best place for you."

The elevation change is about 250 feet. The trails are good, but rocky in places. Beautiful hike and easy to make is as long as you like - just over 2 miles to and from the lake, but you could make it a 7+ mile hike if you go around the lake and/or take some side trails."

Take time to go to the listening room unless you have kids that cannot sit still and be quiet. IT is a place to go and relax with eyes closed as long as there are not noisy people around. From Teton Village, drive slowly and you will likely see an elk cow and calf"

KNOW AHEAD OF TIME - there is only parking for 50 cars in the lot, and you aren't permitted to park on the side of the road, so get there early (before 9:30am). The hike to, and around, Phelps Lake is great. There is a jumping rock on the lake that 2 of us jumped off of into the lake, it was very fun and refreshing! There is also a moose (lady) who likes to hang out by the trail, if you haven't seen a moose yet on your trip, you have a good chance of seeing her on your hike."
493,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2015 , Family, ,Love the quiet look at nature!,"Very different experience. Not the usual showy, entertaining tourist center. Instead - a quiet, educational environment to appreciate the sights and sounds of the park. It's disappointing to wait to park your car, but I understand their desire to have a limited number of people on the trails in this area. And - it's worth it when you're hiking to Phelps Lake with just a few other people. The waterfalls and other scenery on the hike are fabulous!"

If the lot is full, you may wait in a line until a car leaves. Luckily we were staying close by so we came back the next morning right when it opened and we had no problem securing a parking space. The preserve center is fantastic for all ages. A lot of factual information along with interesting exhibits that children are allowed to touch. The trail to the lake does not allow for strollers or wheelchairs. Since the number of visitors is limited, it is a tranquil experience and highly recommended. It is located on Moose-Wilson Road and we saw wild moose several times on the road near the preserve!"
498,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2015 , Family,"Wilmington, DE ",Great tour from naturalist,"Nine a.m. tour from staff up to Phelps Lake and back. We were the entire group, engaged in naturalist activities. Focus was not on bagging sightings of big game but on leaf texture, changes in land, poetry of viewing and being in nature. Perhaps not for everybody but we loved it--ages in our group from 5 to 70+. Yay Moe Cairns!"
499,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Deerfield, IL ",Seeking solace,"You have found calm when you step inside the beautiful building constructed on the Preserve. Be sure to sit and enjoy the sound room, where sounds of nature surround you. Also, spend time enjoying the four seasons as portrayed through four panels reflecting images from the forest.

Don't miss the sound room which affords guests the opportunity to sit quietly and be surrounded by the sounds of nature. The trail heads leading to Phelps Lake start at the center. We loved the trail loop that we took. Of course, take care and be aware of your surroundings, it is bear country."

Parking lot was busy but rangers where on hand to organise everyone which was great, didn't wait 10 mins for a spot. It's such a pretty hike with not a lot of 'up & down' so quite easy. We saw all ages and abilities having a go and it's well worth it. You pass little viewing areas which are stunning - overlooking the river with bridges and waterfalls etc. didn't see any wildlife but we didn't expect to as it was about 80 degrees. But so many wild flowers, beautiful (husband bought a book in visitor centre so we can name them all!) every turn seemed to be carpet of lush grass and dots of colour with the amazing Teton mountain range backdrop. Phelps Lake doesn't let you down either. So peaceful and it was calm when we were there so great reflections of the mountains.  As we left we thought we'd pop into the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve, wow! You enter into a fantastic room with sofas and fireplace. Lots of bookshelves full of books on flora & fauna etc. for you to browse at your leisure, there are other rooms with screens showing different films of wildlife and scenery all with natural soundtrack. Go around the corner and there's a round room with high ceiling and speakers which if you sit with your eyes closed plays the sound of the preserve. From animals, birds, insects even rain and thunder! Very clever, very well done. Top marks for a lovely afternoon!"
511,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Jun 2015 , Friends,Westcheter area ,Phelps Lake Hike,Super beautiful. Bring bear spray. We were blown away by the composting outhouse located at the lake ~ well worth visiting just for the facilities! Parking lot fills early in the day so best to go early or be prepared to wait for a parking spot as the Rangers will direct you as folks leave; a very civilized system.

Phelps Lake is a superstar. But if you mean anything more definite about the Preserve, such as programs, etc., it is a bit of a mystery. Passing by the buildings on our way to hike, everything seemed deserted. On the way back, it still seemed deserted. I tried a door, which was unlocked, and went in. A young lady was at the desk in the lobby, but there weren't displays, etc. I couldn't help but think she had a lonely job, because others we talked with had no idea whether the place was open or not. Mind you, this isn't a building on the main street of Jackson; it is out in the woods, and seems deserted. I would recommend some more people-friendly signage, evidence that the building is being used, etc."

545,Laurance_Rockerfeller_Preserve,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Fernandina Beach, FL ",Wow!!!,"We ended up here by chance....it turned into a magical morning!!! The small Visitor Center was very nice staffed by a combination of Rangers and volunteers. Arrived in time for a morning fireside chat (with a real fire in the fireplace which was very nice on a foggy, chilly morning!). After the fireside chat we wandered off not sure how far we would go. The sun came out and we ended up taking an easy 3-mile hike to Phelps Lake....we went on the Lake Creek Trail and returned on the Woodland Trail. We had planned on continuing to Moose over to Morman Row but the road was closed because a grizzly bear was sighted the day before and was roaming the area.....definitely added to the drama and intrigue of the morning. We saw bear scat...not no bear, thank goodness. Parking is limited so go early!!!"
