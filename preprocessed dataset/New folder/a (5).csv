0,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2022,not available, ,Let's ski the Tetons!,"Skied Grand Targhee and Jackson Hole the first week of March. Although it did not snow as much as we would have liked it to, we had the best time! I largely attribute my positive stay with the ski in - ski out accommodations at Grand Targhee Ski Resort. Great terrain, great food, great shuttle, great value. Can't wait to visit again!"
1,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2022,not available,"Ridgway, CO ",ski in/ski out,ski in/ski out can't be beat. All amenities available at the base. Tasty food and craft beers apres.
2,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2022,not available,"Washington DC, DC ",Day at Grand Targhee,"A group up of us came over from Jackson Hole to ski Targhee on a very cold cloudy weekday. Huge amounts of terrain, not crowded. Snow conditions were good. It is a one or two day ski trip ski area."
3,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2022,not available,"Plymouth, MI ","First timer, definitely won't be the last time! Love this place!","First time here, and it won't be the last. The resort reminded me a bit of Brighton, Utah, in that it is a compact base area, with minimal lodging. While only a little bit of snow fell during our week stay, the conditions kept the snow nice, and it was easy to set an edge into the snow which was nice, considering nearby places like Jackson Hole were hardpacked ice. Must be a magical weather bubble over the Ghee!    I'm a pretty good snowboarder for a 54 year old, and the Blacks and Blue runs are aptly scored. The terrain is really good for snowboarders too - not too narrow, and the glades with actual spaces between the trees allow the adventurous to weave their way down without worrying too much of hitting a dead end. Great balance of open terrain to non-groomed glade areas.    The high speed chairs really zip along, and even the Blackfoot chair isn't too slow - but that doesn't matter as you'll be glad to rest your legs a bit between fun runs.    We stayed at the Lofts (5 story walk up lodging, and got a 2nd floor room). The ability to snowboard right to our lodging building and take a break was fantastic. The lodging is a bit dated, but it was clean, and the rooms were warm and comfortable - never lacked for hot water for showers either.    I love the low-key vibe, nice compact 'base village' and friendly nature of the area. It's great staying at a place that doesn't feel like a giant corporate ski resort machine that churns visitors in/out like an assembly line. Such a relaxing vibe.  The nearby town of Driggs, ID is also great to have nearby - good restaurants too. I'm definitely coming back to Grand Targhee! I'm a fan!"

5,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2022 , Family,"Idaho Falls, ID ",Increased Prices,This used to be one of our favorite places to ski but as prices went up it got less affordable to go as a family. We decided to go check it out again after the holiday crowds have cleared out some. They’ve changed the parking now where part of the lot is paid. We got there early but were still in a lower lot. We did not see a a ride to the hill. The crowds weren’t to bad since it was after the holiday rush. The “No Easy Way Down” signs were up at the start of the day and there was no visibility at the top due to a current storm. We’ve skied here enough to know the trails but with the wind and icy snow it was a struggle. There was also a lot of ungroomed powder which can be a good thing but it was very heavy and hard to ski. They closed Dreamcatcher part way through the day so we had to ski the easier chair Shoshone and wait in lines. We’ve found over the years the employees are less and less friendly and it doesn’t have the welcoming feel it once had. If the conditions are right it can be a great day of skiing but with fewer discounts and higher prices we don’t go as often as we used to.
6,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2022 , Couples,"Cleveland, OH ","Amazing skiing and views, not to be missed!","We had been told by avid skiers that if we were in the area, this place was NOT to be missed. We are so glad we took their advice and made a 3 night stop at this resort. We had just skied 5 days at Big Sky and we were on our way to Jackson Hole. Grand Targhee is not on Ikon, but the $115 lift ticket is worth every penny. There are only 3 lifts, but those 3 lifts offer so much open beautiful terrain. We did not have the powder that they are famous for but it really didn’t matter to us. There were no lift lines at all. The main lodge is small and the bathrooms and locker situation could use some updating. We took a private lesson with Tuffy ( I skied the morning and my husband skied the afternoon) which was the highlight of my trip. I learned so much in my 1/2 day and it has served me well here in Jackson Hole. Thank you Tuffy!!!!! Since everything is so close we put our boots on in the car and walked to the lifts. Parking is also free which is great. We can’t wait to return !"
7,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2021 , Family,"New Albany, OH ",Great holiday ski vacation spot,"If you want early season snow, short lift lines, friendly and professional staff, and nice low key vibe then Grand Targhee is the spot. It has much more of a local feel than the large ski resorts.  Note that Targhee does not have the luxury or creature comforts of a larger resort, so go in with the right expectations."
8,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2021 , Family, ,Loft can pack in 14 easy,Staying so close to the lifts in there loft was really nice. No elevator but fantastic views. And we came 12 kids in and only one slept on the ground in a sleeping bag. No one of my kids out there friends complained about the room. That says a lot.
9,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2021,not available, ,Perfect!!,"We could not have picked a more beautiful place to spend our Christmas this year! Lots of snow, beautiful views, good food, friendly people!"
10,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2021 , Family,"Landers, CA ",Worst Service Resort,"We have patronized this resort for years. I love the hill and the relatively easy atmosphere that comes from a smaller resort. However, this place has bar none the WORST customer service of any resort I have visited. From lodging to guest services to the pro shop, they will DO NOTHING to assist or, even worse, make things right. Unfortunately Grand Targhee is now raising their prices and looking to complete with the bigger ski resorts. Good luck Grand Targhee….it’s going to take a lot to get this place in shape. We have tolerated beat up, worn out facilities in exchange for a relaxed, friendly, family oriented environment. Sadly that place is a distant memory."
11,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Nov 2021 , Family,"Punta del Este, Uruguay ",Great experience!!!,"Great place, good snow, great people. If you have an issue with altitud you can get a bit tired. The place is fantastic. It is great to learn to ski, specially kids."
12,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Whitewater, KS ",Amazing views!,Stumbled onto this place from our cabin in Driggs Idaho. Ski resort by winter bicycle haven in summer!!! Watched the ski lift and ate at the restaurant!!! Chicken sandwich was amazing!!! Waitress was friendly and very informative!! Will be going back to ride the lift!!!
13,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2021,not available,Indianapolis ,Fabulous!,We visited this resort and found that in the summer it is a bicyclers haven! We rode the ski lift to the 9800 ft above sea level peak. The view is spectacular! They have a great gourmet restaurant at the bottom of the ski lift where we had great flat bread and Bore ribs. We enjoyed watching the mountain bikers ride down from the summit of the mountain.
14,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2021 , Family, ,Amazing ski experience!,"Skiing closing weekend was amazing! We skied 3 days prior at Jackson Hole. Snow was rough for last weekend, which was expected. Planned one day at Targhee and it was PERFECT! I wish we would have stayed more days here as well. My 8 and 10 year old skied this mountain with confidence and gusto. Resort set up is darling, had a fantastic meal at The Branding Iron and used the pool and hot tub before bed. Next trip we will ski more days at Targhee. We stayed in the Souix Lodge and had a wonderful room. This is a much smaller resort than JHMR, but truly a gem. Teton View to the traverse had the most spectacular views!!"
15,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2021 , Business, ,Pierce Skate & Ski’s 10th Annual End-of-Season Ski Testing Trip,"If you are looking to break away from the “Corporate” ski & snowboard experience the “Ghee” is the place to be. Fantastic snow quality, quantity, scenery & terrain; with a great independent spirit & vibe."
16,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2021,not available, ,Incredible place!,Words can say enough about how great this place is! Our family had a blast! The skiing was amazing and our kids had so much fun!
17,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2021,not available, ,Epic Spring Break Trip,My family and I loved coming to Grand Targhee for the first time. We stayed in the Teewinot lodge for two nights. We skiied for two days. We loved the low-key vibe. No lifts lines. Epic place to ski with spectacular views.
18,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2021,not available, ,Big Mountain Fun without the Big Mountain Price,"If you like to ride big and steep with no lift lines, beautiful views, low pricing, and down to earth people then Targhee is the place for you!"
19,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2021,not available, ,Spring Break Winter Fun!,"We visited Targhee for the first time during Spring Break 2021. It was the week before Easter so late in the season with hard packed/icy snow in the mornings. When the afternoon sun softened things up, the runs were much more fun. We were hoping for the deep powder experience, but apparently that peaked in February/early March this year.    Regardless, we still had a very fun time. There were plenty of hills for all skill levels and the crowds were thin. We originally had a return trip to Banff, Canada booked for this week but the border closure upended those plans. Vermont was plan B until very warm spring weather and rain caused us to find a reasonable resort in the west.    We relied on Trip Advisor reviews when choosing Targhee and we concur that it is an amazing place for families. We stayed in Driggs, ID which was a short 20 minute drive with a convenient shuttle service! We will definitely try to go back again in the future!!"
20,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2021,not available,"Kyoto, Japan ",100% enjoyable,"Awesome experience! Such a manageable mountain and experience. Zero lines (anywhere). Super laid back. 100% joy. If you're looking for luxury or something to do other than the mountain, though, better find another spot."
21,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2021,not available,"Boise, ID ",Great skiing for everyone!!,"Great resort with skiing for ALL levels, beginner to expert cliff jumps. My kids loved the Shoshone forest when they were younger and now enjoy the expert runs with varied terrain. Highly recommend lessons for all levels. I took an intermediate lesson and Ted B was so amazing I am now skiing bumps in the powder. There are two restaurants on property. The Branding Iron is the fancier one but the other one (forgot the name) is actually better. Love the ski-in-ski-out condos."
22,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2021 , Friends,"Newport, RI ",Intimate ski resort with great terrain and snow,"Intimate ski resort with great terrain and snow. The village is small and convenient and the mountain was easy to get to know, but offered plenty of fun for a few days."
23,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2021,not available,"Moses Lake, WA ",This place rocks,"Grand Targhee is a cozy, old school, ski resort. Mush more like a local ski hill than a corporate monster. Don't be fooled though. Targhee is a super fun place to ski. Amazing views, terrific terrain and the SNOW. Have a few refreshment after the day's over and then visit one of the slope side grills for some really great outstanding dinner options. Targhee is a gem."
24,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2021 , Friends,"Provo, UT ",Best value resort in America,"Incredible snow, terrain, and views. No night life, which is fine. Could use a few more restaurants and accommodations."
25,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2021,not available,"Asheville, NC ","Amazing location, stellar instructor","We purchased a $129 package with a half-day lift ticket, equipment rental, and half-day ski lesson. What a deal! The location is great and the views are incredible. But the real clincher was our ski instructor, Steve. He was SO patient, kind, and knowledgeable. Even though I discovered skiing was NOT the sport for me, his help was so appreciated and worth every penny."
26,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2021 , Family, ,I love this place,"I Love this place! Great atmosphere, terrain for all and affordable skiing for families! The rooms are clean and with comfortable beds!"
27,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2021,not available,"Lake Placid, NY ","Resort is great, make sure your reservations are accurate.","One of my favorite places to ski in North America. It is a great ski-stay resort.    Our reservations were messed up, but I believe that is outsourced.    Friendly staff and great place to ski."
28,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2021,not available, ,Amazing snow and terrain.,"Great mountain to ski. Although a bit small, the snow and varied terrain are second to none. Will for sure do the snow cat skiing next time. Get there early as parking does fill up fast it seemed."
29,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2021,not available,"Denver, CO ",Poor customer service and parking,"Targhee's parking lot completely filled around 8:30am which requires you to ride their shuttle system which is slow and unreliable. Locals are probably aware of this and are able to plan ahead, but there was no obvious warning on their website. I spent an additional 3 hours getting to the resort. I paid for a full day ticket, but was only able to ski a half day as a result. They refused to refund the difference. Very disappointed by the time wasted and the poor/disrespectful customer service team that refused to any attempts at restitution."
30,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2021,not available, ,"Awesome Vibe, great snow, friendly employees!","Cool mountain that doesn't crush you with the mega-resort feel. Everyone there was having a good time - guests and employees, alike."
31,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2021 , Solo, ,Exquisite,"I came to Grand Targhee Resort ski runs so I could improve myself on beginner runs and took lessons so a professional could judge the safety of when I could move up run difficulty. Instructor Kathleen did exactly that, she says that I am now at the novice level. I feel more and more often that I am dancing on the slopes."
32,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2021,not available, ,Awesome skiing and views!,"We stayed in the Teewinot Lodge, great room, close to everything, ski in/out. Only complaint is there are not a lot of options for dining at the Resort, less than normal during our stay due to Covid. But the skiing was great, great snow and runs. Can drive into Driggs for dinner, or over to Jackson Hole thru the Teton pass which is an awesome drive on a clear day!"
33,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2021,not available, ,Scenic wonderland,"Spectacular views of western side of the Tetons. Great green runs and family programs. Blues are steep, fast and wide. Lots of glade skiing. Heavy mist forms in am in January making visibility difficult on higher lifts. Colder up higher and catwalks are very fast and narrow. Expert lifts plentiful. Not much to do at base. Small local operator with only a few restaurants and zero apres ski action. Maybe because it’s January, COVID and a labor problem. Day trippers tailgating in the parking lot. Lower lift ticket prices."
34,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2020,not available,"Minneapolis, MN ",It's about the snow,"My brother and son and I were planning a holiday ski trip in Wyoming/Montana. I was willing to deal with early season conditions as we wandered around, but we decided to go out of our way to have a Grand Targhee day so that we could have one stop on the trip that we could trust to have quality coverage. Targhee didn't disappoint.    In case you're not familiar, Targhee gets 500"" of snow per year, and it was the first ski area in the country to be 100% open this year. The day we were there was two days after a 15"" single-day dump of snow. And me... I love skiing crud. To me, crud is just the midpoint between powder and moguls, and I just love it. The groomers were soft and beautiful, too. So much of Targhee is above the tree line, so you can just start down from the summit on a groomer, then if the mood strikes you take off into some moguls or glades. It's totally wide open.    Targhee is not exactly the type of skiing that I normally gravitate to... I usually prefer areas that are more labarynthine... just a preference that I have to wandering through the woods over wandering above the tree line. But what it does, it does brilliantly. It's way out of the way for me, and I WILL be back."
35,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2020 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",Summer Chondola Ride up the Mountain,"Perfect way to see the resort. Buy a ticket at base of resort for $15.00 pp to take chondola ski lift up the mountain. Smooth ride, although kind of windy to Breathtaking Views from the Observation Deck...a must visit if staying at the Teton Tepee or surrounding area!"
36,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2020 , Family, ,Well worth a visit!,Loved this resort! It would be fantastic in winter and when COVID isn’t messing with everything! Beautiful views from the top of the mountain too. Well worth the cost of the lift ticket (summer price is $16 per person). Everything you need is in the village which is about 50 yards from any of the different lodging options.
37,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2020,not available,"Redding, CA ",Nice,We should have stayed here because there are things to do. Went and sat outside and had a drink. Was relaxing. Hubby skied here years ago and liked it.
38,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2020,not available,"Cinque Terre, Italy ",beautiful views,The sky lift had nice views. It was inexpensive comparing to nearby sky lifts. There were drinks available for purchase. Outside and inside seating
39,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2020,not available,"Pocatello, ID ",Three day ski weekend,"Another excellent time at Grand Targhee. Friday (2/28) was a blue bird day there with full sun and good snow. Ski shop was quick and friendly, Brady got me ready to go with some all mountain skis and we were set. The bar was hopping with great music, Anna behind the bar never missed a beat to give great service and conversation as she was able. Great onion rings if you like. Fish tacos, not so much.  Can the wind come up, sure it's a mountain and it did the next day. But it was still a wonderful place to visit and the people (customers and staff) are fantastic."
40,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2020 , Couples,"Savannah, GA ",Great first time mountain skiing,"My husband and I decided to try mountain skiing for the first time. My brother recommended Grand Targhee as a good mountain for beginners. We knew we needed help so we signed up for lessons. Our instructor Dave was AWESOME! We wasted no time and hopped on the ski lift right away. With some good pointers on the way up, Dave had us skiing immediately. He coached us all the way down, stopping a few times on the way down to let us catch our breath and to make corrections with our form. We made several runs with Dave, getting faster and more confident each time. Dave was patient, funny, and the perfect instructor for us. After our two hours with him, we were ready to try it on our own. It was a beautiful sunny day and with our new confidence we had a great time skiing—the green runs of course! I highly recommend Targhee if you are new to skiing or if it has been awhile. Lots of runs to choose from and everyone was friendly and helpful from the rentals to the food court to the gift shop. And of course we highly recommend the ski school and Dave. It was the perfect day!"
41,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2019,not available,"Norcross, GA ","Some good skiing, needs more customer space.","Nice little resort. The skiing was good at times, but when the wind is strong at the top of the mountain is not very pleasant. It can be really cold, and then warm for a few hours, then getting chilly again. There were plenty of food options, my only issue was there was not much room if you were not eating to spread out and just relax or have a place to change and leave your things. There are lockers downstairs but it seems to be a bit crowded."
42,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2020,not available,"Idaho Falls, ID ",Good skiing when the conditions are right.,"We've been skiing here for over twenty years. Still a fun place to go but we've seen prices really go up over the years. They no longer have a family season pass so we just go a few times a year when we have some two for one discounts you can get at the local gas stations. We can then hit a few other ski hills nearby. The last few weeks have been good for snow accumulation but the wind and visibility are often an issue. Be prepared by dressing for the conditions and know the trails. If you wait until after the holiday rush it's not as crowded. The first chair can be busy but then the lines drop down once everyone heads to the other chairlifts. There are a couple of on hill lunch options and you can also eat a sack lunch upstairs in the lodge. No real ""lodge"" area for non skiers to sit and enjoy the view."
43,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2019,not available,"Middleburg, FL ",Great Christmas Skiing for a Florida Family,"For a family who has never skiied before, this was the perfect ski resort. Our two boys, 11 and 14, took lessons with Jackie, and she was awesome. The boys having never skiied before were nervous at first, but with her patience, they were hitting the slopes the second day. Jackie truly worked miracles as our oldest wanted to give up after the first couple of hours of ski school, but with her help, he LOVED skiing, and we are already planning our trip back. It is a beautiful place to ski and very family friendly."
44,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Sep 2019,not available,"Berrien Springs, MI ",Check out the chairlift,"No snow--it was early September. But we took the chairlift up, got great photos of the Tetons from the west side, and hiked down to the lodge."
45,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Eustis, FL ",Fun,Enjoyed finding this place. It was beautiful day. Plenty of seating outdoors just to watch bike riders and hikers take off and return. Decided to take lift to top-the views were breathtaking. Could have sat there all day. Since my husband did not want to ride lift down(height bothered him) we took the 3 mile hike down-so glad we did. The views continued to be awesome and flowers were blooming everywhere.
46,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Sun City West, AZ ",tent camping with walls,"When this reservation was made I asked if this is a place for seniors and i was told, we have a lot of seniors who come here. This place is for skie rs only. The accommodations are so old and dated they are pitiful. The sink is about 24"" off the floor, the toilet is about 15"" off the floor. No a/c, no ice machine, just old old furniture.  In reality, it is camping with wall only. TripAdvisor rates this place a 5. How? Have they ever been there. I have lost all faith in TripAdvisor. I paid for 4 nights and left after one. I lost the balance of what I paid. Really pitiful! Shame on Trip Advisor."

48,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2019 , Couples,"Big Sky, MT ","Front desk staff great, skiing great","We came here for a couple of days last week. Everyone at the resort was super friendly, except the Branding Iron staff. The front desk guy ( cant remeber his name but he had an Ole Miss shirt on) was really nice and helpful. Locals are nice, the mountain is great. Hit a powder day and had a awesome time. Except at the Branding Iron. Those servers were rude. End of the season attitude."
49,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2019 , Family,"Bryson City, NC ",great ski mountain all around!,"We got our daughter a ski lesson with Bill from Minnesota. He was AMAZING and our teen who had been really nervous now has confidence. EVERY EMPLOYEE on the mountain has a great attitude and seems to love their job. This is the last week of skiing for the year and they are still enjoying their jobs. That says a lot about the management there. The mountain is not crowded at all, great slopes, great employees, etc. Can't say enough good things."
50,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2019 , Family, ,Ski school is awesome!,"We have come to Grand Targhee for years. Very family friendly, challenging terrain and usually excellent snow. This year my daughter didn’t want to go to ski school because she’s 12 and thought she was good. We convinced her to go on the first day and she lucked out and got Micheal as a ski instructor. He was awesome and she asked to go back 2 more days. He was a great motivater and pushed her to do things that she was timid about doing. He really helped her build her confidence on the ski slopes. They even worked on the terrain park several times and now she is seeking out jumps on the slopes. Micheal is a great asset to your ski school and we can’t wait to go back next year"
51,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2019 , Couples, ,Grand Targhee ski resort,"Friendly staff, first class ski school, incredible snow conditions, nice cafes and restaurant, short to almost no lift lines!"
52,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2019 , Family,"Saint Louis, MO ","Its a great time, if you like laid back casual ski resorts, not upscale","4.5/5    Skiing -- very good for beginners, the kids and I (snowboarding) had good lessons, and lots of green runs from their own lift. Were confident enough to try a tough blue on the last day. The only negative, is there are not greens/easy blues from the top, so very short runs, even if quite a few of them. Seems like a perfect place for an intermediate, tons of options.    Snow -- went late march and still had 110"" base, and one day of 7""! That being said it was so much snow it was actually harder for us beginners than non-snow days.    Food -- basic cafeteria, sandwich place, fancy place, bar, decent enough food, at as expected high prices, but not too out of touch.    Lessons -- great for us! (3 different lessons) friendly and very helpful. I personally progressed a ton with just a half day lesson (my 3rd time boarding).    Equipment/lift tickers/Prices -- Rentals/lift tickets ok, Cheaper than bigger resorts, good equipment, but look for deals so you don't pay list.    Vibe -- now here's the key for us -- short lift lines, casual people, relaxed atmosphere, snowboarding friendly. Just our style 5/5 in this area. If you are a type B traveler like us, this is a great choice (and the local town perfect too). If you are a type A, high flyer -- head back to Jackson Hole"
53,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2019 , Family,"Boulder, CO ",Authentic old school ski resort,"This resort has a lot going for it -- tons of terrain, lots of vertical, high speed lifts, great views (when the clouds clear), and almost no people there. It isn't a snooty high end ski resort, it's an old school ski area with a cool vibe, but not a tiny local ski hill. There are a variety of activities, like cat skiing and nordic skiing. They have all the amenities and services of a larger resort, with a down home feel. The parking lot is paved, the food is a good value, the terrain is a lot of fun, and the employees are friendly. If you are looking for a getaway to spend some time with friends or family, there is nothing better than a ski vacation, and Grand Targhee is really high on the list of the best ski areas in the country."
54,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2019 , Family, ,Great Snow / Great People,This is our spot for the 'mancation' during the winter season.  Great snow. Great advanced instruction program. Amazing kid zone.
55,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2019 , Family,"Hot Springs, SD ",Outstanding Value and Tons of Snow,"Targhee is a great area with unbelievable snow, a great staff and excellent accommodations. Your ski dollar will go much further here than anywhere else out west. It gets unfairly compared to Jackson Hole due to its close proximity, but Jackson is a world class resort that only a small handful of resorts in the US can compare to. In addition, much of what makes Jackson Jackson most skiers can’t handle and never ski anyway, nevermind the world class expenses for tickets, lodging and food.    Targhee has something for everyone off of every lift so friends and families of different abilities can ride the lifts together while doing their own thing on the way down. Best of all, you can ski directly to the lift with no waiting in line - ever. And tickets are dirt cheap!    Never stayed at the base hotels, but the condos at Teton Creek Resort just a few miles away are first-class and a great bargain. Easy to drive or take the free shuttle. The nightlife in Driggs is severely lacking, but if you bring your own party with you, who cares! FYI, Driggs has an outstanding grocery store that rivals any you can find in a big city to stock your condo kitchen. But they’re not open on Sundays so plan ahead!"
56,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2019 , Family,Plymouth ,We feel blessed to have found Targhee! The staff are some of the most amazing humans on the planet.,"Great overall experience and Jordan the kids' ski school instructor who tought our almost 3 1/2 y.o. how to ski is a fabulous teacher and overall exceptional person. The staff are personable and make Targhee an outstanding resort. The Branding Iron has some of the most amazing food and Lindsey, Bobby, Ken and Mason are the greatest.

58,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2019 , Family,"Little Rock, AR ",Great family ski resort!,Overall experience was exceptional! Snow tubing experience was scary for friends child with special needs when he went flying over the red plastic barrier. They immediately got a guy to monitor and groomed the area to help slow them down. Jessie was an exceptional employee. Skiing was great and weather was fantastic while we were there. Whole staff at this place was exceptional! Couldn’t be better!
59,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2019 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Outstanding stay at a gem of a winter vacation haven!,"If you want to experience powdery snow in the most incredible, down-to-earth atmosphere, Grand Targhee is the place for you! Every single person we met at this beautiful Wyoming resort was as friendly and welcoming as I've seen anywhere. And all the activities are so well organized. What we loved the most, beyond it's majestic beauty, was how low-key the entire area is. We're not all that interested in the big resorts that have little character. Grand Targhee is a smaller resort with amazing character! This was our first real winter vacation, and it exceeded our expectations! We went out to Targhee to fat bike, and though the weather wasn't conducive to it every day we enjoyed the hell out of it when we were finally able to get on the bikes and ride! We weren't planning to snowshoe, but we ended up doing it twice and it was definitely a highlight of the trip because the scenery was unparalleled and snowshoeing was one of the best ways to see it! Though we're not skiers, we took a couple of snowboard lessons from super knowledgable instructors and had a blast! Next time we'll probably take some ski lessons, as well. But they had so many runs that I can't imagine there not being something for every skill level. If you're looking for a top-notch, serene, fun winter vacation, Grand Targhee is the place to go! And we here it's just as awesome in the summertime (which we are definitely planning to check out for ourselves)! Thanks to all the wonderful people at Grand Targhee for making our winter vacation so memorable!"

Many wooded areas with lots of space among the trees make every slope an exciting adventure for kids to adults at every level. Terrain parks are also available for every level to make your days even more exciting. There are also the usual groomed areas to pick up speed.

What a fabulous experience from booking to end. Friendly folks to get us going. Booked a lesson, rental equipment and all day lift ticket. All for around $125. So reasonable! Check in Was a breeze but It would have been great to do an online waiver. Only two laptops were available. Smooth rental process. Folks were so nice. They knew what they were doing and got us set up quickly. Plenty of lockers available. Our lesson started on time. We got so lucky! Our group ended up being a private lesson. My husband and I were thrilled. Marcus was SO patient and skilled. He got my husband going on the magic carpet papoose run then took me on the lift. Lots of good tips. We both felt so comfortable. Got several runs in. Plenty of options with wide trails to practice. Plenty of fresh snow too. What a treat. Had a snack for lunch in The Trap Bar then finished the afternoon with our friends. Went back to The Trap when we were done and caught a band while we sipped on our beverages. Great place to eat good food and drink - plenty of bar choices. Super friendly service in a cozy setting. Equipment return was a breeze. Had such a blast. We plan to take total advantage of this little gem and return tomorrow."

We've been going to Targhee for about 10 years and enjoy our stay every time. The folks are friendly and they always have great snow! The nightly rates are a great value, and the facilities are always clean and comfortable. See you next year!"
66,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2019 , Friends,Pittsburgh ,"Beautiful setting, but...","Grand Targhee is a beautiful ski area. As an intermediate skier, though, I found it difficult to find my comfort zone. The greens were really short/easy runs that were labeled as a Kids Zone, but the blues were as steep as the blacks here and were harder than blacks at other mountains. There wasn’t anything in between. I’m glad we visited for a day, but it will not be on my list for the future."

68,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Washington DC, DC, ",Winter Wonderland,"Grand Targhee was a completely surprise. I didn't even know this day trip was included in our ski package for Jackson Hole when I booked the trip. So didn't know what to expect until we got there and it turned out to be the best day of the week! This is a much smaller resort, a lot more peaceful and totally uncrowded. We were told that the nickname for the resort was Grand Fog for its mostly bad weather but we lucked out with a bright and sunny day (after two days of heavy snow in Jackson Hole).    Winter wonderland was the first thing that came to mind on seeing the beautiful pristine slopes with the white frosted trees against the backdrop of the cloudless blue sky. At first sight trails here seemed a lot easier than Jackson Hole, however many turned out to be challenging enough and if you went off trail by mistake as one of my friends did you'd better learn to like an expert fast until you are back on track. But overall, this is a resort with more fun trails for beginners. The expansive greens around the Shoshone lift were really easy, but my favorites are the blues off the Sacajawea lift, wide open and isolated - by mid afternoon there were still untouched corduroys to make first tracks on - as well as the Teton Vista Traverse (lots of glades) off the Dreamcatcher Quad, the magnificent view around the bend of the Tetons is not to be missed."

71,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Hailey, ID ",Legendary!,"GTR is a skiers delight. Soft, billowy pillows of velvety snow, no lift lines, plenty of powder, a great bar, decent food, excellent staff. Yes, this is a family friendly resort and it was great to stay on mountain with all the kiddos and generations of ski bums. It brought back fond memories of my early ski days with my dad and siblings in rustic surroundings. Ski hard and play nice and stay in bounds. Great lessons for love and life.    Hats off to the staff! First, Katherine at the reservation desk, thanks for the welcome and great advice. Next, the ski school was very helpful. Then the waitresses at the Trap Bar are nothing short of amazing. They turn over a packed house at least three times a day with no break and keep on smiling. Michelle, you rock it! Since there was 8 inches of freshies, I rented fat skis. It made all the difference. The service was great and the setup of ski shop is phenomenal. Many, many thanks to Mark Hanson for making our adventure a home run.    For the record, the beds are comfortable with good pillows. The space is clean but minimalistic. There is plenty of hot water in the shower. Bring your own kleenex and ear plugs. If you want to pay three times as much for luxury, go to Sun Valley. If you want to ski your butt off, come here. Only, don't... we want to keep this secret to ourselves."
72,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2019 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Amazing ski resort....terrible kids ski lesson experience,"Let me start by saying we love Grand Targhee as a ski resort. This review is for the kids ski school. We took our daughter for a ski lesson and we were amazed to get a call 30 min later to go pick her up because she said she was tired. One of the things that bothered me the most was that they just gave up on her. I was on the bunny hill the whole week after this with her and I saw other kids reacting the same but their instructors gave them a break and tried again, they didn't just give up on them. I went there to talk to them and see if maybe we can find a solution to this as we are all so excited about this class. Their answer was...."" sorry because she said she was tired we can't do anything about it"" ....I mean she was a 4 years old who just spent an hour in the car waiting for parking because they were so busy that day. All in all our experience was very disappointing."
73,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2019 , Family,"Hye, TX ",Best vacay ever,"I almost do not want to write this so the world doesn’t find out this was one of the best ski experiences in the country. My fam and I escaped after Christmas for 2 weeks and had an amazing time. The vibe was excellent. While the website is not very functional, inner department communication marginal, we were not really sure what to expect prior to our arrival. Ski instructors were awesome. Tuffy, Bart, Dillon, Panini, Freebyrd to name a few made our family’s trip so much more enjoyable. Our kids were molded into little Schreader’s. My wife and I enjoyed a private lesson which was amazing. The ski shop was awesome. Nic and Adam and several others made sure our gear was perfect and really cared how we were outfitted. I will be purchasing any more gear from their shop due to incredible customer service and attention to detail. They were very accommodating to us Texans who only ski 6-8 days a year....Lift lines were insane.... one day we had to wait 45 seconds.....great little restaurants, good vibes. My kids cried when we left and I was right behind them. We will be back!"
74,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2018 , Family,"Denver, CO ",Tubing is a blast!,"Went over to Grand Targhee for an afternoon of tubing with kids. The tubing is blocked in sections of time. Price is very fair and all information is on their website. The amount of time might seem small but it is actually just right, it is a two hour block. It is important to check to make sure a private group is not scheduled at the same time you want too. You cannot get in and tube if a private group is booked. The amount of people per time block is 30 people. It never gets crowded because of this and the number of people flow very well. There is a magic carpet to to get you from the bottom of the hill to the top. Each tube also has a cord for you to pull your tube with. You can ride single or double on the tubes as well. The walk is about 100 yards from the ticket office to the tube area. Over all it is a very nice family area and a good time. If you have never done sledding and want to do it, it does not get nicer than this!"
75,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2019 , Family,"Montgomery, AL ",Great day of skiing,"Small ski resort, but offers great runs for all abilities.

Woken up by loud stomping upstairs, sound of water gushing in the pipes and people talking outside the room, scraping ice in the courtyard. Old carpets. No apres ski. Is it worth the Slopeside location? You decide."
80,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2018 , Couples, ,Awesome Ski Vacation,"I can't say enough good things about Grand Targhee. The resort itself is small and quaint., but absolutely first class. It is in an isolated mountain location, far from the bright lights and noise of any town. Walking between the lodge and the restaurant/bar/cafe is peaceful and quiet. The only noise or lights at night are the groomers working up and down the slopes, creating beautiful corduroy for your first run in the morning. Targhee is known for world class powder And even if the powder is skied out, the natural snow covering the entire mountain will not disappoint you. The rooms were simple but adequate, the food at the Branding Iron Restaurant was first class and amazing. Ski demos were available. There were cozy fires burning on the deck in the evening. There was entertainment at the bar. When you stay at Grand Targhee, you are in a world of your own. If you are trying to choose between Grand Targhee and another resort, I highly recommend the G'hee."
81,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2018 , Family,"Lander, WY ",A fine day on the slopes!,"What a wonderful day on the slopes. This isn’t our first time here and will not be our last time either. The Grandson took a lesson in the morning, snowboarding then we skied and snowboarded respectively together in the afternoon after our lunch at the Branding Iron (see review). Just wish we could have spent more time but the evening came all to soon. Having skied at all the local spots on both sides of the Tetons. I can say that Grand Targhee is the most multi-ability, family friendly, reasonable cost resort around."

84,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2018 , Solo,"Tetonia, ID ",As Goid as it Gets,"When so many ski areas are praying for snow, Grand Targhee sits right where the jet stream usually park itself when not shifting north or south. Hence it consistently gets 500+ inches of snow every winter.    GT has great terrain, one of the best and prettiest beginner/teaching areas, and with 3 lodges and 4 restaurants it has all you need for a day trip or extended stay.    And down in the Teton Valley, ID there are over 35 restaurants to suit your tastebuds."

We arrived and went straight to the bar to watch football and grab food. We had the nachos which were great and enough for an army, chicken fingers, and the chicken club wrap. It was all great. Staff was very friendly. My only complaint was that we had heavy luggage and no elevator. We had to drag three 50 lbs bags up two stories. The rooms were comfortable with plenty of room. Would return."

93,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2018 , Friends, ,Not a place for a disabled person.,"The room was not as clean as it should have been. When wet the shower floor is very slippery. I was told that I only had to walk up 2 steps to my room, but I had to walk up 9 steps. Both of us are disabled and getting ourselves and our luggage up to our room was painful and difficult. In order to use the long steep ram and just 2 steps it would have been more painful. The ramp is too steep to accomidate our mobility chairs. When I tried to tell the manager about my displeasure he walked to his office and closed the door. Because of where the restaurant was situated we missed dinner and the ""free breakfast"" , there was just no way we could make it to get food. If you are disabled or partially handicapped I recommend you stay away from here."
94,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Lincolnton, NC ",Old place,This place was not what I expected. It was small and we stayed in the old part I guess. If you stay there ask for the new lodge. It was like staying in a dorm. The bathroom had no place to get ready. I will not stay there again. It maybe a better place to stay in the winter.

100,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2018 , Friends,"Melbourne, Australia ",Small niche ski village,We paid a visit to this ski report during summer. Lots of mountain bikes using facilities. Most shops and eateries were open. What you need to do it stake the ski chairlift up to the summit for what can only be considered a breathtaking view of the valley but also the Tetons and ranges around them. Spectacular view and was better view I consider that the main tram car Teton village in Jackson home side. Do yourself a favor and go for the drive over the pass from Jackson to view from the other side. No where near as busy place either.
101,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jun 2018 , Family,"Danville, VA ",Not enough for the price,When I booked this hotel we had planned on day tripping to the Teton area north of Jackson. What I had not counted on was how far and how long it would take to get there from Jackson. There were very few people here and we weren’t given any perks like lift tickets or kids activities. We ended up spending our time and money away from the resort.    Notably our shower was awful. You had to duck to get your head under the shower and the tub floor felt unstable. The room size was nice tho.

The scenery is fairly awesome as well. I really enjoyed the various restaurants and bars. With the famous Jackson Hole Resort being so close, most of the crowds are over there, leaving fresh epic lines untouched over here and usually zero lift lines!! Worth every penny!"
104,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2018,not available,"Jackson, WY, ",Simply spectacular,"This is my favorite hill. Even though it has half the vertical of Jackson Hole who advertises 2,500 acres of terrain, Targhee claims 2,600. It is a broad resort with more intermediate and beginner terrain, 70%, than most other areas though its black and double black offerings are zesty. Having its base at 7,800 feet above sea level and being located on the windward side of the range, there is more snow at the bottom here than at mid mountain at JH. If you call the snow phones, it will sound like JH has more snow but that’s because they measure at the summit and Targhee at their mid mountain.  The vibe here is casual and non commercialized. Lack of visibility? It happens, even at JH, Big Sky. More often here I admit it. On those days I ski or ride the trees. No problem."

I stayed in a rented condo (not slop side) but didn't mind driving to the resort. There are 4 ski lifts with few lines. I think people just do not know about this place. Most stay in Jackson Hole (on the other side of the Tetons) and fight the lines. The skiing is better here! I took a private lesson and got back up on my feet in no time. Ate several meals that were really good.

This is a great place for skiers of all abilities. It is low-key, friendly, the prices are reasonably and you won't find better snow quality anywhere in North America!    If you are driving from Jackson Hole, you have to go over Teton Pass, so check the road conditions if it has snowed recently as the pass can be a bit intimidating if the road is snow-packed."

A great mix of aggressive, intermediate and beginner terrain, open trails, tree trails, hike in territory, snow cat territory. I don't really dig on the terrain park but they had what looked like a great one.    It had snowed 10 - 12 inches a day or two before we arrived and there was still plenty of un-tracked snow. This resort is not like your basic resort where all the runs are cut out of a forest. There is tons of open terrain with well spaced tress that give you access to pretty much the whole hillside. It all depends on how tight you like it. Pretty much everything has a groomer right next to it as well. So if your a beginner or progressing, nice, even terrain is never too far away.    If you go to Grand Targhee and don't hike up to Mary's Nipple you're just doing it wrong all together. The hike looks challenging but it's not bad if you're athletic enough to be on the mountain in the first place. You should be at least intermediate to handle the way down. The view is stunning and there are multiple ways to get down both sides.    Did I mention the lift lines? It must be because there weren't any. We pretty much did laps just getting right back on the lift with almost no wait. There was even a competition of some kind on the last day we were there and you hardly noticed the extra people. We did go during the week, so take that into account, but the only other place I have seen lines so consistently short is Wolf Creek.    In short this place is great if you love pow and hate lines."

The resort was not overrun with people, and the lift ticket was actually affordable. Found some empty runs behind the beginner area that were challenging and not overused. Will go back for sure!"
120,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2018 , Friends,"Annapolis, MD, ",Best skiing in the Tetons!,"Seriously the best skiing in the Tetons. We got lift tickets for first Friday in March for $69 on Liftopia compared to $143 at Jackson Hole.  Grand Targhee is on the snowier side of the Tetons and gets more powder than Jackson hole. 97 trails and a bunch of fast quads, no gondolas. If u like powder and no lines than def hit this place. Lots of tree skiing, 9700 top elevation, powder for days. No crowded on a Friday during a foot of snow day at all. Snow was amazing visibility ok at the top and good middle and base.  This place rocks, we came to ski Jackson hole which we did but Grand Targhee is better for skiing. Jackson hole has like a town at the base but u pay for it, $20 nachos, $7 beers.  Grand Targhee had cool little stores, general store with beer for sale, clothing store, ski store, a cheap cafeteria, bars a d hotels!!!  Grand Targhee has been the best skiing I have ever done, seriously better than JacksonHole, twice as big and 10 times better than Killington or Jay's Peak."
121,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Manassas, VA ",Loved this Resort! Awesome Snow and Vibe!,"My husband and I recently visited in Feb 2018 for our first time. We were staying in Jackson and planning to ski more of Jackson Hole Resort. After experiencing Targhee we instantly changed our plans and skied our remaining days there. We loved the family vibe here, not to mention less crowds and Superb snow conditions. As east coast mid Atlantic skiers, we don't have much experience with powder, so we took a private ski lesson to improve our powder skiing, our instructor ""Tuffy"" was awesome and we were able learn new skills for our skiing toolbox. :-). Also able to enjoy the wonderful powder further into our ski vacation."
122,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Family,Duluth ,Family ski trip,"First time staying slopeside, loved the concept. The base area is small and compact and very easy to get around. The free shuttle to Driggs is great. No lift lines!!! Stayed for 6 days. Freshcoating of snow everyday. Staff is very friendly."
123,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2018 , Family,"Park City, UT ",If you can see it’s grand.,I’ve been here about 10 times and 9 out of 10 days visibility was from very poor to NONE. I’m told that skiing can be very good but because of limited visibility I’ve never experienced it. If you come I suggest you stay at the resort. Slope site accommodations are not fancy but save you a long drive up and down the hill every night. And most nights they have free live music
124,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Friends,"Fort Worth, Texas ",My teacher was the nuclear bomb,"I done said all it all  In my review of my ski lesson  Well , one or two or 3 more things  I always knew a used way too much hip/ torso/ shoulder  In my turns to start the ski rotation  But I really didn’t know any other way  Beth explained it to me - you point Your toe left of right  With your femur ( hey - me smart - I knowed what that was)  Took off my skis and practiced “ hour glass” in the snow - my rotation is so weak- I am a hockey stop jump guy. Which is nonsense on greens and blues    I do long traverses to get my mind rightfor the next turn    When practicing tighter quicker turns ( in trig terms the length of my traverse from side to side is the amplitude and the frequency with which I execute my turn is the period )    So - my turns- I wanted a smaller amplitude - shorter traverse - and a faster frequency - shorter period ( told u I was real smart)  Instead of 5 turns in 100 foot run - do 8    While practicing more turns per run I could tell I was user my inner heels more - she explained by doing that my pivot point ( that center of the arc that my skis swung thru ) was up closer to the ski tip ( pivot point to foot is the radius - center of circle to edge. ) instead of using my heel to execute the turn - I could envision more “toe pointing” ( rotation point at front of boot - not in the heel ) then the pivot point is near my front binding"
125,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Couples,Half Moon Bay ,This is our favorite place,It is so beautiful here and so fun to stay. Just be sure you qualify the room you are staying in. The rooms int he building behind the front desk are grossly out of date and seem like a dorm room. The Teewinot and Sioux buildings have good room tho and the experience of being up there and not having to drove anywhere is excellent. We will go back as often as possible. LOVE that the resort is dog friendly. Our two guys had a blast as did we.
126,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Family,Pelham ,Globe this place!,Great snow and awesome trails. Never a wait in the lift lines. Room was nice and the lodge was close to  everything. I would definitely recommend this place in winter and I want to come back in the summer with my bike.
127,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Family,"Orem, UT ","Great Snow, Poor Infrastructure","Targhee is a great resort if you are looking for quality snow and short lift lines. It is never really ""crowded"" like the big Utah resorts (PC, Canyons, Alta, Snowbird, etc.) On the flip side, that is probably due to the lack of infrastructure. The amenities at the resort are lackluster at best. Even small resorts like Sundance have 100x the infrastructure of Targhee. The main lunch spot is packed, even on slow days, making it difficult to find a table. We stayed at the Sioux Lodge and I doubt they have renovated since the day it opened. It was nice to be right at the base of the ski hill, but the room felt like a motel room from the early 70's. Bottom line: if you are the type of skier who is simply interested in hitting the slopes and avoiding crowds, Targhee is the place for you. If, however, you are interested in some of the frills like nice dining, pools, spas, shopping, etc., I would look elsewhere."
128,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Solo,"Yakima, WA ",Big mountain skiing with a view (sometimes),"Skied on a day when the clouds lifted enough to see entire ski area, there is plenty of terrain and if you hit a powder day it is incredible. Mostly groomers the day I skied which were excellent, no surprises and fast from top to bottom and the snow was excellent for carving."
129,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Solo,Novato ,Off the hook!,"So well done it defies words. I have a new obsession and it is this resort. Great vibe, quiet with awesome people. However, if you are looking for a bustling night life, a scene in which to be seen, this isn't the place."
130,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Solo,"Philadelphia, PA ","Great snow, no crowds","Targhee has excellent snow, a challenging range of runs, and no crowds especially during the week. Fog is the only wild-card. Accommodations are a little Spartan but reasonably priced and a seconds away from the lifts."
131,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018,not available, ,Cat Skiing-buyer beware,"I feel like I should write two separate reviews of Grand Targhee as I truly enjoyed the resort. The mountain itself is fantastic with lots of great lines to discover and some fabulous hike to terrain.    This review is specifically for the Cat Skiing. My husband and I signed up to go out on a Friday in February. We were called the day before to tell us it was cancelled and our only option was to get a refund (minus $25 pp) or reschedule. We had been skiing Targhee earlier in the week and they had gotten 10 inches of snow a few days prior to our day. We knew the snow wouldn’t be 100% untouched but were ok with that considering we’d get to ski a new part of the mountain and the fact that only 11 ppl go up a day meant it should be relatively untouched. They told me via email that they’d need 6-8 inches of new snow to run the cats.    Rescheduling wasn’t an option as they were booked solid until the end of our trip so we were effectively out $50.    I was annoyed but kind of understood-skiing is always a weather dependent sport and stuff happens. We ended up skiing the targhee resort on that Friday and Saturday.    What really annoyed me was that, to my surprise, the cats actually went out on Saturday even though targhee only got 2 inches of snow (nothing major was in the forecast). Far short of the 6-8 I was told they needed. The conditions were virtually identical to the day before. I also rode up the chairlift with a few locals who worked at targhee and were telling us that the conditions in the cat area had actually been really good since the weather had stayed cold.    The only thing I can think of is that they didn’t have a full cat for Friday and wanted to save the snow for the weekend when they did have a full group but considering that the people who booked are out real money if they cancel, that’s a really crappy way to operate a business. I’ve done cat skiing other places and have never encountered anything like this before.    My advice to anyone considering cat skiing who isn’t local and doesn’t have the ability to be flexible with rescheduling is to skip it and hire a local guide to go to the targhee backcountry/side country instead. It’s a bit more tiring on the legs but it’s cheaper and more reliable and the terrain is amazing."
132,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Durango, Colorado ",Ski trip to Grand Targhee,"Grand Targhee may have had the best snow of all the resorts we visited (5 total), certainly had the most snow. Unfortunately, the visibility during our two days there was terrible - whiteout/vertigo conditions on the top 2/3 of the mtn. Since it was our first time there, it was difficult navigating around when you couldn't see more than 20 feet ahead of you. Would love to ski there sometime on a bluebird day!"
133,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2017 , Family, ,A Family Favorite!,"December 2017, we made our 3rd trip to GT. We all love this place. Perfect for all ages. Our kids are comfortable and can navigate the resort and slopes simply. The skiing was excellent, as usual. Always affordable (book early and get a promotion). Pleasant & clean accommodations (we have stayed in a few of the different lodging buildings). Pool and hot tub are a must-do. Lessons for the kids have always been helpful and enjoyed. Snow-shoeing was a fun learning experience (first time). Will return. Recommend!"
134,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2018 , Friends,"Carleton Place, Canada ",Read the fine print for Cat ski at Grand Targhee!,"Our group booked a day of cat skiing at Grand Targhee resort but unfortunately it was cancelled the afternoon before due to ""windy"" conditions. We were staying at Jackson hole resort but decided to go skiing at the resort anyway to avoid looking a day of our planned vacation. Skiing was actually pretty good so not sure why the cat day was cancelled however we were charged an ""admin"" fee of $25usd for each of our group of 6 even though it was booked as one reservation....so basically working out to a charge if almost $200cad. Thought the least they would do is offer credit to the lift ticket that day...this was not offered when asked."
135,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2018 , Family,"Helena, MT ","Always fun, Consistently great snow and a small time feel","Hey thanks GT for great family memories and looking forward to many more. I have booked with them for the past 6-7 years with no issues, the condos off the Mt are great a short drive each morning no problem. The skiing, I have never had a bad day at GT! last time 8-12' of snow when I thought was going to be bad, warm and rainy the day before turned out to be great. The service is pretty good, not as good as it used to be but still very personable."
136,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2018 , Family,"Auckland Central, New Zealand ",Try something new,"We wanted to add a skifield on to the end of the holiday in Big Sky 2018 and took a chance on Grand Targhee. We were so glad we did. It is a reasonable 4 hour drive inn the snow through the hills from Bigg Sky to Driggs.  Targhee had lots of snow, some reasonable groomed runs if you wanted a cruise and lots of powder stashes for fun. Targhee is a smaller ski field and was not crowded. We chose to stay in Driggs, with a 30min easy drive up the hill.  So pleased we came."
137,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2018 , Friends,Madison ,"Small Resort, Big Time Skiing","Grand Targhee was an amazing experience. Our room wasn't advertised as ski in ski out, but it essentially was. Even if we weren't staying where we did all the lodging they had was still within walking distance to the hill. For the price we paid we would be paying triple what we did at any other resort. The room we stayed in was a bit dated looking, but what does that matter when you are coming out for skiing. (If you are skiing to stay in a five star room sorry but you are doing it wrong) It's not the biggest resort in the world either but they have a lot of terrain to ski for there size and even have a great hike up/back country area for those who like to earn there turns. Overall great trip and Grand Targhee, don't change you are doing your resort the right way!"
138,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2017 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Adult Family Christmas skiing trip,"This is our 2nd trip to Grand Targhee Resort. The skiing is exceptional. Olympic hopefuls and qualifiers in skiing and snowboarding use these slopes. There are many, many challenging slopes here. That being said I’m a novice skier. We just don’t live close enough to snow or go often enough to progress much. Just when I’m feeling adventurous it’s time to go home. Colorado slopes are very crowded. Lots of college age kids. On the slopes I felt like I was going to take out someone with my zigzag skiing and snow plowing. NOT HERE! There is a separate easier slope with its own lift. So I got used to skiing all over again without getting in the way of more confident skiers. The resort and town are fun but definitely not a bar scene. It’s for serious skiers, locals and families who want great deep fresh powder. Our daughters are grown and we are empty nesters. This was the perfect vacation for the young adults as well as us more seasoned adults. We booked 2 snowmobiling excursion; 1 to Yellowstone and 1 to the Teton National Park’s Mesa waterfalls. Both were fun days. Everything we ate at the resort and in town was delicious. Everyone we met and interacted with, from the lodge, real estate company, restaurants (at the resort and otherwise), excursion company and airport were the nicest, friendliest people.    On site restaurants; There are 4 restaurants; an upstairs out of the way pub, a made to order grab and go type restaurant with about 8 tables, a commissary where you grab a tray, select a la carte food and seat yourself, and a more upscale restaurant that takes reservations. We ate at all of them and they were all great. One day there was an outside grill making burgers and sausage dogs that smelled delicious but there wasn’t any seating so us southerners opted for inside, to warm up a bit and catch up on the bowl games. We enjoyed local craft beers as well as bison burgers and Wydaho fries at the upstairs pub. They have live music at night. The chili, soup, and loaded baked potatoes were delicious at the downstairs commissary. We ate tasty breakfasts burritos at the grab and go restaurant one morning. We ate Christmas Eve and Christine Dinner at the Branding Iron. It was very nice.    Problems:    The resort does not do a good job of checking you in and coordinating your agenda. There was no itinerary waiting for us and no notes in the system about us. We had booked (2 meal reservations and 2 days of ski lessons/rentals on site as well as the 2 above mentioned snowmobiling excursions through the resort. We also booked a condo instead of staying at the lodge. When we showed up at the lodge to check in. Our names didn’t come up in there system. 4 different groups were flying into an event I had planned and booked and it looked like there was no record of us. I was beyond upset. The condos are not actually part of the resort and are managed by a real estate company in Alta. They sent us back down the mountain to a real estate company to check into the condos with the assurance that our itinerary would be waiting on us with the keys for the condo. The real estate company had no itinerary for us. It was a nightmare.    Here’s the problem: once they take your money Grand Targhee reservationist are no longer in the loop if you are working with a 3rd party vendor I.e. condos and snowmobile companies. They don’t make it clear when you book, it is a 3rd party vendor and that from they will not be involved with that part of your trip any longer. And the rentals / lessons / restaurant reservations are controlled by the individual places. Nothing is coordinated by the reservation department after they have your money. But they don’t tell you that when you book. The front desks indicated they would’ve had our itinerary if we stayed at the lodge but they also said the real estate company would have our itinerary. This is not an employee not doing his job problem. It is a system and policy problem! The employees are following the guidelines and are trying to make your vacation amazing, they are just set up for failure. There’s not enough staff to meet the number of people in the area for the holidays and the process they are following is not customer centered. They double the price of rooms and excursions and lessons but not the staff.    That being said if you can remember when/where you are supposed to be on your own, it was booked. We had a great time after a few drinks to calm me down. Thank goodness I had made events in my calendar on my cell and had all the emails in my phone for the snowmobile company’s contact info.    My advice:  If you are going to the area to primarily ski, stay at the lodge. OR  If you are planning to explore the area and ski a couple of days; stay someplace not affiliated with them, book your own excursions at a reduced price and go skiing at Grand Targhee for the days you want to ski.    P.S. Our 1st trip to Grand Targhee was in 2004 and was part of a 100 person trip. We stayed at the lodge. We did similar excursions. A typed itinerary was handed to us at check in. Obviously management has changed there system or the coordinator of our trip did the itinerary for us.    Transportation: 2004 trip we rode a shuttle from the airport to the resort. Then a shuttle was booked to take us to excursions. It was seamless. 2017 trip thank goodness we rented an SUV. No shuttles were available from the townhome to the excursions. The shuttle from the townhome to the resort was pretty on time except for Christmas night. The shuttle was one hour late taking us back to the condo one night after a full day of skiing and dinner at the restaurant. - see pictures of us asleep on cold bench waiting for shuttle. In the morning and at night it is very cold there. You have to stand outside by the road to catch the shuttle, like a kid waiting for a bus. Even though there is a loop right next to the townhome lobby. If you don’t go outside the shuttle doesn’t stay at the stop long enough for you to see it and get out to it before it takes off. So if you aren’t staying at the lodge, rent a 4 wheel Drive vehicle.    An on-site photographer did a photo session with us on the slopes. The pictures turned out great and were well worth the money!"
139,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2018 , Friends,"Oxnard, CA ",Fresh Snow! - January 2018,"Such a nice place to ski/board. According to Jackson locals, Targhee usually has better conditions than Jackson Hole. Well, on the day we went, they'd gotten 16 inches in the last 24 hrs and conditions were great. Now when you get a good fresh, deep coating of new snow, the plows can only work so fast to groom runs. That being said, a lot of the runs were not groomed...which was just what we were looking for!    According to locals, driving the Teton Pass (WY 22) isn't much of a problem when it's snowing. They said the Teton Pass rarely closes and if it does, it's not for long. Our rental truck was a 4x4 so we weren't too concerned. Parking (midweek) at the hill wasn't a problem either. There's a few nice places to grab something to eat and or drink (see specific post for those reviews). I would have given this place 5 stars, but hill management left us stranded and walking a ways to get back to the base lodge. Apparently, they don't clear ALL runs going to chair lifts before closing it down! So be prepared to walk if you like catching last runs!"
140,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2018 , Solo,Minneapolis ,Great snow. Affordable lift and lessons. Less crowded.,Best snow outside of Alta. Alta just does not have the base like Grand Targhee does this year. Affordable lessons with excellent instructors and not crowded.

Due to the lack of fresh snow in early January 2018, the slope conditions were poor. We decided to try Grand Targhee since an acquaintance from Colorado highly recommended it. We loved Grand Targhee!! The slope conditions were superior to Jackson Hole. We loved the Grand Targhee bowls and and wide open spaces, as well as the sections for tree skiing. We ate lunch at the Branding Iron Grill - it was delicious! We enjoyed the ""Pub Style Fish and Chips"" and the ""Portabello Sandwich!"" We will be returning to Grand Targhee!"

We then went to the ""Branding Iron"" and were told that their kitchen was closed as well, so we wound up with what we referred to as a ""North Korean"" evening. It was a very hungry night for us and we feel we should have been warned of the scheduling change so as not to starve."

149,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2018 , Family,"Arkansas, ",A place serious skiing,"We visited Grand Targhee and it’s a far cry from Jackson Hole Mtn. The village is much much smaller with just a few condos and accommodations and a few shops and restaurants. Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice it’s just that it’s for skiers and winter sports enthusiast. There’s not much else to do. The scenery is spectacular and the powder was better than Jackson Hole. There are only 10% beginner runs so if you’re not pretty good, there’s not much to ski. They do have snowshoeing trips as well as a great Nordic skiing area. Go to Targhee to ski, go to Jackson Hole to do other things. It’s a nice drive over the pass from Jackson, took us an hour and 15 minutes in good conditions."
150,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2017 , Family,"San Francisco, CA ","When no one has snow, Targhee has snow AND charm","Once again, proving its reputation as an area that opens among the ten earliest in North America, the ""Ghee"" shone again. When other areas across the West had 10-20% of their runs open, and 9"" base reports---Grand Targhee had 63"" inches when we arrived and 73"" when we left lol.    The instructors are all expert skiers and ours in particular, Skyler Kauf, was excellent---superb skier and safety conscious. Found the best snow and viz in each case.    There are a few things about Targhee to know as possible negatives:  1) It can be bitter cold. Single digits and then below with wind chill. You have been warned.  2) It gets a LOT of snow---but that means low visibility from the main lift. In those conditions, a ski instructor will know how to maximize your ski time and find the best routes---which might involve using either the Blackfoot lift or the Sacagawea lift may have better visibility conditions.  3) It's hard to get to: the closest commercial service is Jackson Hole and Idaho Falls. Jackson Hole requires to travel one of the most dangerous stretches of highway in the United States in winter weather. Idaho Falls is much, much flatter but has fewer direct connections.  4) Apres Ski is...not so much. You're there to ski.    We've been back two years now; I bet we go ahead. There's only 5 lifts but they serve 95 runs and there just isn't that much skier pressure---there are only three small parking lots and there aren't enough accommodations to swamp the area. It's a special place."
151,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2017 , Couples,"Mountain View, CA ",Best ski resort to practice ungroomed slopes,"I skied mostly in the East Coast, so I am not used to un-groomed slopes and more used to hard groomed slopes. I always wanted to try practicing more in un-groomed slopes, but many ski resorts have un-groomed slopes only in steep advanced slopes. Targhee has a lot of un-groomed slopes in blue, so it was perfect for me to get used to un-groomed skiing. I felt their entire mountain is skiable, and dividing them into different slopes was almost meaningless. Although we went during peak holiday season (between Christmas and New Years), we almost had no lift line. This is a great no-frills resort where you can just focus on skiing at great terrain at a reasonable price. If you like Alta in Salt Lake City, you will love Targhee."

Chevy Chase doesn't need to see. Neither do we. The catskiing hur is not steep, but it's deep. Not that I got to go this time or ever since I was like 15.

We did a little searching and found Grand Targhee and decided to take a chance and give it a try.  We were not disappointed. The resort was great. The staff was super nice. The mountain was beautiful. The lifts were fast and had very short lines. The rental gear was in great shape. The fellow skiers were nice and helpful and courteous to us less experienced folks on the slops.  Next time I want to go for a ski vacation, I will go here instead of Park City. It was great!"
158,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Poulsbo, WA ",Great even in the fall,"It was about a 20 minute drive from downtown Driggs and well worth it. Although we did not stay here, we made use of the chairlift. It was a steep ride but we were able to get a spectacular view of the Tetons! We did not know there were restaurants there so brought our lunch and were able to eat outside at a table. There were numerous people taking their mountain bikes up the lift and riding down various courses. Although we are not the age to do that sport, it looked like great fun!"
159,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Spanish Fort, Alabama ",Grand Targhee Resort,It was a wonderful stay. I was staying at the lodge. The room was nice and clean. There was a grill outside. I did BBQ and spent a great time. Thank you.
160,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2017 , Family,"Fort Lauderdale, FL ",Awesome place for a very reasonable price,Everything was thought over in the units design and layout for a very comfortable stay right from a very huge sofa bed to large bedrooms. The two twin beds in kids room were full size so two kids could easily sleep in each one of them. The facility itself is very good. One can easily spend a day just at the resort itself Barbequing and doing other outdoor activities.
161,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2017 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Lovely in the summer,Everything was well cared for and comfortable. Great location and NOT Jackson Hole!  We were lucky to be there for solar eclipse.  And there is a new water sports company in Driggs rent gear shuttle to and from Teton River.

Absolutely love the endless number of things you can do there. The summer is awesome for hiking, rock climbing and mountain biking and more. The winter offers amazing ski runs, snowmobiling and much more. The area is just big enough to have fantastic snow, but miss all of the big lines. The snow in the winter is fantastic!"

167,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Couples,"Reminderville, Ohio ",Greatest snow on earth for end of March,"Love skiing Targhee because it has the greatest snow on earth for the end of March. Spectacular views of the Tetons. Uncrowded slopes you have to yourself and NO LIFT LINES. Lift ticket prices do not blow the budget. The coolest and most scenic ride to any ski resort. FREE parking. We stayed at the Teewinot Lodge which is a 100 yard walk to the lift but ski to the front lobby after a great day of pounding the empty slopes. The base village is small but has everything you need, two restaurants, ski shop, small general store. Their is not much to do after the lifts close because it is a small base ""village"". You can use the free shuttle bus to get to Driggs, Idaho for more dining options. We skied Targhee two years in a row because the first time was very enjoyable."
168,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Friends, ,Beginner skier review,This review is written by a BEGINNER skier for beginners... I found Targhee a little overwhelming for a beginner skier. Even the beginners' slope was kind of steep. Then going up to the top of the green slopes was very very intimidating. Everything was so steep compared to the slopes I had learned on near Bozeman MT at Bridger Bowl. But then again that's how you learn and everyone falls skiing. As a beginner you really need to just suck it up and go out and do it every day. (I recommend at least four solid days skiing as a beginner to learn and retain everything you're learning.) I didn't take any lessons here but every day we were there there were a TON of little little kids in group lessons on the beginners' slope. Just from the look of it I'm glad I took my lessons elsewhere first BUT if you're here and are a first time beginner I think I would absolutely suggest taking a private lesson just to make sure you're learning what you need to to handle the slopes here. Other than that everyone was really nice and accommodating. On my third day I only wanted to do a half day of downhill and spend the afternoon cross country skiing and they let me just swap out my rental equipment really easily. The xc trails are also pretty intense for a beginner but they're well groomed (check the schedules for when they do the grooming) and the views are fantastic. I had to walk my skis up the first part of the first blue trail bc it was going to take all my strength if I had tried to ski up it (plus it was a little icy that day) but after that the trails were really nice. Hope this helps for beginners!

170,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Couples,"Layton, UT ",Loved skiing this mountain.,I loved the long wide steep hills at Targhee. The terrain is groomed very well and the views of the Tetons is great.
171,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2017 , Family,Plymouth ,Adult ski lesson,"My instructor (Dean) made me feel very comfortable skiing. I had fear of steep and long hills. The long hills are a breeze. He taught me things that other instructors left out. Like the ""fall"" line. I need a little more practice on the steeper hills, but my fear is less. The best 2 hours spent!"
172,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2017 , Solo,Wyoming ,"Friendly, helpful staff and not crowded","I visited Grand Targhee ski resort on a Wednesday in early April. There were no lift lines and uncrowded slopes. The skiing was what one would expect for spring conditions: nice groom in the morning that gets a little icy towards afternoon, with a little mushy snow in the base area in the afternoon. (I can't speak for the ungroomed areas as I am a terrible off-groom skier and tend to avoid.) However, there's a wide range of skiing for everyone and I thoroughly enjoyed the green and blue groomed trails. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The resort is laid back and family-friendly from what I can tell. There's an area of shorter green trails that appears to be designed for young skiers and beginners. Plenty of black diamond runs as well. Again, something for everyone. If I ever travel this way again I would not mind spending several days at this resort.    My only disappointment is that I did not think to rent skis from somewhere outside the resort; rental for demos skis was $57 and the rental shop at Grand Targhee charges the same amount whether or not you have your own boots. (I had never experienced that before; is that a new trend for resort rentals?) On the bright side, the staff in the rental shop were very helpful with suggesting demo skis that worked for me.    Again, great skiing, friendly staff, and beautiful scenery."
173,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Family,"Big Sky, MT ",Great Ski Race Weekend,"What a special place Grand Targhee resort it. The views are amazing and the skiable terrain was perfect. We enjoyed staying at the resort for a fun spring fling ski race. All amenities are within walking distance. The food was delicious at Snorkels for breakfast, Trap Bar for drinks and tater tots, and The Branding Iron for a nice dinner. The kids loved the heated pool. And the adults loved the hot tub. We would for sure come back!"

We decided that we would spend part of our Spring Break at Targhee and splurge on a ski-in, ski-out room. It was worth the money. We enjoyed skiing then recovering in the wonderful saltwater pool and finishing off the day in the hot tub area. We will be doing this again - and we won't be waiting another 38 years to do it."
176,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2017 , Family,"Stockholm, Sweden, ",This year's best ski day,"Sometimes it is just so pleasant to exclude major ski resorts, sit back and enjoy the laid back atmosphere. Looking for an experience with a variety of restaurants, shopping, etc.Get back in the car,and leave this place for us! Intermediates will be pleased to learn that 70 percent of Grand Targhee’s terrain is meant for them. That said, Targhee still has plenty to offer more advanced skiers with several runs catering to their skill levels too."
177,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Family,St louis ,"GTR- Ski-tastic, not luxe in Teewinot Lodge.","This is our second trip to GTR. For our first visit 6 years ago we were treated to some of the finest powder skiing ever, really in my life- it was that good. This past week, Mother Nature wasn't so kind. Typical spring, we drove up from Jackson in the RAIN, feeling worried... But don't fret! The runs were in great shape- it was quite warm so the Sequoia chair we could really only use in the mornings. The staff here are friendly and just fantastic. The recent upgrade to Blackfoot lift was GREATLy appreciated- we loved the Good Bad and Ugly runs! This is a value place to stay with family. Don't expect high luxe accommodations, but everything is clean and comfortable. Beds soft and comfy sheets. Pillows a bit big and puffy for me, but husband loved them. Basic bathroom. Whole thing could use some updating, but then maybe it wouldn't be such a great value and it would lose some charm. Rooms are just as they appear on website. TV channels allowed us to watch March Madness without any problems. Humidifier and Boot dryers were in the room. Heated pool and Hot tub are not over crowded, and are a 1 minute walk from Teewinot over to Rendezvous Lodge. Bring your favorite beverage from the general store which is just on the walk over, and watch the light on the mountain while soaking your sore tootsies! Love the casual friendly skitastic vibe here.All of the staff from top to bottom are friendly and helpful. I would give it a 5 star rating if they would PLEASE just upgrade the food choices here. Breakfast and lunch are good at Snorkels, not Deer Valley but you didn't come here for that, now did you? Dinner is a challenge after the 3rd day for lack of choices/fare.....had me craving a grocery store.... the Lodge doesn't have a kitchen option, (that's the Sioux and it might just be worth it to me next time to walk the extra 50 or 100 feet for a kitchen I could call my own, and I'm no cook!). As with our last trip, we split a week between Jackson Hole and Grand Targhee and that worked well for us."
178,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Family,Cleveland ,Greatest Snow Ever!,"Targhee is a laid back place with limited but very good services. All lodging is right at the bottom of the hill. Great place for family as you do not have to worry about younger children. Very family friendly and Friendly overall. You have to come for the snow, 540"" a year!"
179,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Family,"Cleveland, Ohio ",Awesome out of the way place!,"Want to relax? Want to stay at bottom of resort? Want a safe place for families? It has the best powder anywhere in US, the mountain is fun with a lot of variation. Services are limited but good. Also, best ski vacation value you can ask for. Relax, its Targhee!"
180,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Couples,Jackson ,First time skiing and staying.,"We stayed in the Teewinot Lodge. We had a lower level room with a tiny view toward Sacagawea Lift. Secluded except for the traverse to get over there, but the skiers are looking another direction and going fast, so not an issue. The furniture was nice, but the bathroom and carpet can use updating. Great resort for skiing of all levels. Great sandwiches at Snorkels. Good drinks at the trap bar. Some good dinners at The Branding Iron. Will definitely go back to ski."
181,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Friends,"Covington, Washington ",Sunny Grand Targhee,Targhee is a great place. Our trip was all fun in the sun. The room was small but clean and comfortable. I would recommend Grand Targhee as a ski or summer destination.
182,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Family,"Houston, TX ",Great Terrain and restaurants,"With the slopes a short walk across the patio, you couldn't ask for more convenience. Food at Branding Iron was great - try the brussel sprouts and elk burger. Very low key and no crowds over spring break. If you are stopping at Jackson Hole, you should make a point of skiing at least a day or two at GT."

Today was not a POW day...but I still enjoyed ""the Ghee"". I liked the terrain and I'd love to try it on a Powder Day. A wee bit remote...12 miles outside of Driggs, Id. It was worth the trip."
184,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2017 , Solo,"Sydney, Australia, ",Nice compact mountain,While not large there is plenty here for a full day's skiing and a several day stay. Mix of groomed and ungroomed and some lovely tree runs. Lift lines during my mid week stay were never a problem. Good free parking lot.

The resort has much to offer and is very attentive to the guests. We stayed in an off-site condo and had a great time at the mountain and in town.
187,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2017 , Solo, ,Max your trip,"Targhee is a solid value in most every respect: cost, terrain, conditions, lack of crowds, weather (except for the fog) equipment availability. Not many dining, shopping, grocery (the ""general store"" is the size of a closet) or entertainment options: the main lift closes at 4, but ""after ski"" options inexplicably run 3 - 6. After that pretty much everything shuts down. But you'll need the early sacktime anyway, the skiing takes everything you've got."
188,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2017 , Family,"San Antonio, Texas, United States ",Small Town Feel,"We chose this resort for ski lessons for our children because of the price compared to Teton Village. We thought they did a great job with the kids (ages 5-13).  There was a decent balance of slopes for all our skiiers. The blues tended to be narrow, but doable.  We skiied 2 days here.  Not the best snow since nothing new fell, but good enough for these Texans."
189,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2017 , Family,"Nelson,NZ ",Staying at Grand Targhee,"Small but a great field with the most fantastic views and scenics, well groomed slopes, not crowded and good lifts (3 chairs). Although only 3 chairs this gives a vast terrain as they are well positioned. Well worth a visit for a few days. Previously we had some great powder skiing and there are some safe and close walks to be done. Staying up on the mountain is good but the food is limited and average in the evenings. But there is a good shuttle service to go down the hill for an evening meal as an option."
190,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2017 , Couples,"Boise, Idaho ",Skiing at Grand Targhee,The powder is nice. There is a lot of fog at this resort. We are 50/50 with tolerable fog. It can be really socked in and if you do not know the resort it can be hard to navigate. Every trip we have good powder one of the days of skiing.

194,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2017 , Family, ,Hidden Gem,What a great vacation location & experience. We have been going to Targhee for years and it is a family tradition. The Targhee snow is always great. the new Blackfoot quad is a great addition.
195,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2017 , Friends,Hunteraire ,The Ghee!,"Oh the Ghee! Best hidden ski gem! I don't want to say to much good about it. I don't want it to get too crowded!  No lines, no waits, so don't come!  Oh wait, the chair lifts are slow and it does get cold there, so don't come!"
196,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2017 , Friends,"Charlotte, NC ",It's a drive but worth it,"I've been here many times but never had the opportunity to comment on like this. Well, like the title says, the drive to get here is worth it. Not as steep as JH but has challenging areas if you want them. I'm 49 so for me, those ripping days are over but I still love going down these mountains. If you're an ""easy does er"" type skier, then you'll be right at home here. I do wish they had some quality tshirts like once before. Over the years they've lost a shop or two and the decent shirts evidently went with them. Other than that, parking not bad and everything else easy to get to. Just great skiing."
197,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2017 , Family,"Clarksville, Maryland, United States ","Super friendly, no crowds and tons of snow","We received over 2 feet of snow in the first 3 days of our trip and had some luscious powder runs, even after lunch. However, Targhee does get A LOT of fog and wind. For two days the tops of all the lifts were with near zero visibility for many hundreds of yards down. So be super careful planning a trip here if some members aren't accomplished skiers/boarders.  There are almost never any crowds, most days you will ski onto the lift. Most of the excitement after the initial powder is consumed is in the glades and treed runs, so again, lower level skiers may be left searching. Also, given the wind the tops of most lifts are icy and difficult.  However, if you can handle the days of difficult weather you will be rewarded with miles of powder, fresh tracks and with no lift lines, way more skiing than almost any other resort.  Also, as in my photo there are crystal clear skies and fantastic views in every direction."
198,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2016 , Family, ,great family vacation/ski place,the rooms are a bit dated but a good deal for the price. the staff is very friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs. food is average. the location is absolutely spectacular and the resort has a good layout and great snow. the lifts even on the busiest days never take more than 1-2 minutes to get on. can't go wrong staying here
199,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2017 , Family,"Midway, Utah ",Fun for all ages,Great terrain for all levels of skiers in my family. Thanks for a wonderful time and we will recommend this resort to anyone.
200,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2017 , Family,"Dublin, Ireland ",Very rustic but family friendly,"This is a throw back ski resort. Don't expect much. But there is enough here to make it a worthwhile trip. People are friendly all around. The private instructor we got for our group's young daughters did a great job. The snow was great. There is something here for everyone to ski. Ski rental place was overwhelmed and needs bigger digs. They also need more storage lockers as we were left high and dry. However, it seems like a safe place overall. The food options are ok, nothing special. Just a reliably ""good"" place to ski. But definitely a ""great"" value based on the lift ticket cost."
201,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2016 , Friends,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Amazing skiing without the crowds,"A hidden gem in the Tetons. Easily accessible from Driggs/Rexburg/Idaho Falls and even Jackson Hole, the mountain has it all. Great off trail skiing as well as groomers for all levels of skiing. Good restaurants for meals (with good coffee!) This is one of my new favorite places to ski"
202,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2016 , Family,Australia ,"Good spot, great people","Grand Targhee is a unique place with a special vibe that I suppose further development would ruin. What we found mostly appealing was the people - the staff and guests. Most friendly bunch of skiers and workers we have come across anywhere in our travels. The folks of Wyoming or is it Idaho :) are truly decent and accommodating. Was initially slightly underwhelmed with the size of the resort, facilities and mountain, but were lucky enough to strike a powder day to understand what skiing the Ghee is all about. The pick of the runs IMO would be the ""Good, Bad and Ugly"" and also a ride through on top and down through the gullies at ""Middle Earth"" is fun in deep snow. Highly recommend a visit to Grand Targhee for at least a few days."
203,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2016 , Family,"Oconomowoc, WI ",Snow Cat,"I booked this vacation for me and my two boys ages 13 and 17. My younger son took private ski lessons from Paul M. and my older boy and I went on the snowcat adventure. Everything went incredibly smooth. Greta and Cameron in Guest Services was well informed, helpful and took care of all the details. The Cat adventure was $400 per person for a day of skiing and I have never paid that much money to go skiing in my life. Clearly it was worth every penny. Our guides, Eric and Ryan were the consummate professionals. Before we left the base we were dialed in with transponders and instructed on how to use them in case of an emergency. The Cat driver was very helpful and friendly loading our skis after the run and genuinely loved his job. The Cat took us to places on the mountain you can't see from the base and no chair lift can access. Almost every flake of snow was dry powder (about 24 - 30"" deep) virgin snow with clear skies and perfect weather. We could not have picked a better day. It was incredibly challenging skiing and I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to take my son on this fantastic adventure. The guides would tell us where we were going and where to stay away from (repeatedly to keep us safe). Then the first guide would scoot down the hill to a resting area. Next, one by one, the 12 people in our group would go down the hill making perfect ""S"" shapes in the snow (except me because I was trying not to fall which happened about 10 times), and then the second guide would bring up the rear. Although I was clearly the worst skier of the bunch, neither guide made me feel bad about delaying the group, they just advised me on how to ski the powder better. The views were terrific, the lunch break was welcome and the day was the toughest day of skiing me and my son ever had. I don't know what helicopter skiing is but the guy next to me said he had done it about 20 times and this was on par at less than half the price. When we returned, my youngest son said he loved the lesson, and Paul was a great instructor. We took a break from skiing for a day but the following day me and the two boys hit the slopes. Paul - the instructor for my son's private lesson, did a fantastic job teaching my son to ski. He kept up with me and my older son and even tackled a black hill for the first time. Great people, great adventure."
204,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2017 , Couples, ,"Great staff, easy to navigate","Staff was very helpful with getting us fitted with our rental equipment. All visitors seemed to be very nice, as well. Experience levels are well marked for beginners, intermediates, and experts. Terrain is relatively easy to ski on.

205,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2016 , Friends,"Winnipeg, Canada ",Fabulous Gem,What a great little gem! This is the perfect spot that's got all you need for a ski resort. Has 4 chair lifts and servicing mostly blue and black runs. Lift lines we hardly had to wait. This is a small (yet soooo big) cosy ski resort. The lift tickets are $80/day. The resort has a number of groomed and un groomed runs and we were still able to find plenty of powder even though it hadn't snowed in a few days.  This resort has easily made it into my top 3 places to ride.
206,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2016 , Family,"Washington DC, District of Columbia ",Western Wyoming Treasure,"When people think about Wyoming for skiing they most often think about Jackson Hole. Let them keep thinking that. Those of us who know better will keep enjoying this hidden gem 10 miles east of Driggs, Idaho, that has plenty of steep and never any shortage of deep. Locals know. The apres-ski options are limited, but that's not why we come here. Its 5 lifts service a huge ski area with plenty of blue and black runs and even a fun green area that is the perfect place for beginning skiers to learn.    Targhee is our resort of choice early and late in the season, since they always seem to have good conditions beginning in November and last well into April.    I recommend. But it's OK if you decide to ski in Jackson instead."

On Monday and Tuesday I was still finding powder stashes and doing laps on the groomers since the mountain was wide open. Took a powder refresher class call max 3 powder up. Highly recommend it.

210,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2016 , Friends,"Missoula, MT ",Best tree skiing and snow,"This is your best bet for snow. We always say if Targhee doesn't have snow, it's summer and even then they often have snow. This is a place you go to ski. Apre ski is waxing your skis and resting up to ski tomorrow. Not much else. The Trap is a lot of fun. Cat Ski adventures is a killer deal on some of the best powder skiing you will find anywhere. On mountain lodging is limited...especially if you want something with a kitchen. That said it is one of our favorite ski destinations and we've skied all over the world."

216,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2016,not available,"Queen Creek, AZ ",Great alternative to Jackson,"In planning a trip to Grand Teton National Park, we ""had"" to stay at Grand Targhee because nothing decent was available in Jackson. What dumb luck this turned out to be!  The resort has a number of buildings with different names. Our room was on the second floor of the Sioux Lodge. It was much larger than expected, with a king bed, an easy chair, TV and a mini kitchen with a small fridge, microwave and table and chairs. There was also a balcony with a small patio set.  There was no air conditioning which was fine. While it was in the low 80s during the day, it cooled down to the 60s at night. The room was very comfortable with the bay windows and patio door open.  Most of the other guests seemed to be staying there for the excellent hiking and mountain biking trails. Our drive to the Grand Tetons NP was about 30 minutes, but the beautiful scenery in the mountains made it pass quickly.  There are a couple of restaurants on the property, one upscale, one not, plus a bar.  DO NOT MISS riding the ski lift to the top of the mountain. It was a well spent $15 each.  One afternoon we drove through Jackson and were shocked at the congestion - crowded sidewalks, no place to park, etc. Jackson is still quite a drive to the NP so make it easier on yourself and do Grand Targhee instead."

It is an almost perfect venue for an event like this. The restaurant was better than I expected. I've little experience of ski resorts, but see no reason why a ski trip to Grand Targhee wouldn't be a pleasant experience."

We went up there on a hot day in August to escape the heat. The chair lift ride to the top is a good value and gives you an awesome view of the backside of the Tetons. We didn't mountain bike, but it looks like a great place to do that."

Grand Targhee is a mountain biking destination in its own right, even for those not typically keen on resort mountain biking. Trail access is free and the rental bikes are top notch. After your ride, enjoy a lunch and beers at the lodge while watching the downhillers catch air under the charlift. Mountain biking here is sure to be a memorable experience."

It really doesn't get any better!"

224,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2016 , Family,Florissant ,My Review,"Highly recommend . Unfortunately, we did not have time to fully enjoy and participate in the resort activities - except the swimming pool. I wish we had planned to spend more than just one night there."
225,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2016 , Family,Miami ,An alternative to Jackson Hole,"Near Alta WY. An alternative to Jackson Hole. Very relax. Not to many people. We did not use the lodge. I read other reviews indicating no AC so it could be hot in the rooms during the day. For sure temperatures go down at night. We were staying at a cabin 21 minutes away and every night temperatures would go down.    During the summer they have mountain bike activities, Horseback rides and activities for the kids. We visited during summer but it would be a great place for beginning ski lessons. I was told they have a package which include rental, group lessons and lift. During our visit For 15.00 dollars you are able to use the lift as many times you wish for the day. We saw many bike riders using the lift to the top to later come down using one of several trails.    Everyone we met (at the lift, the activity center, grocery store, top of the mountain) were very friendly. Especially the young woman we met on top of the mountain where they have a wildlife display for the kids. She was very friendly and provided great information. Her customer service skills were excellent.    Highly recommend this location."
226,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Perfect Temps & MTB,We stopped in overnight. Stayed at base of Mtn and caught a nice cross country style ride up one of the trails on our bikes. Great trail maintenence and the views of the Tetons & valley are amazing.  The Trap bar at base is a great place for a beer & food after a fun day hiking or biking.
227,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Midland, TX ",A favorite place to visit and revisit,"I have been vacationing in the Grand Teton/Yellowstone Park area for over 50 years. For the past three years I have been able to see so much more of the area since I now have a brother and sister who have retired out there. My husband and I were advised to drive up to the Grand Targhee Resort area last year with my daughter and her young family. They all had a great time exploring the resort area, and climbing a rock tower. We chose to ride the chair lift up to the top of Fred's Mountain and were stunned by the incredible views of both the West side of the Tetons and the Teton Valley, including Driggs and Victor. We were so impressed with the experience, that we came back again this year. We are not big outdoor sports fans, but really enjoyed watching the bikers riding the trails down the mountain. You can stay up on top all day if you want and as long as the weather is good.Be sure to bring a jacket and hang on to your hat! The staff was very helpful and really seemed to enjoy their jobs. Who wouldn't? I would not go up to the top if you are afraid of heights!"
228,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2016 , Family,"Woods Cross, UT ",Nice little gem of a resort,"Excellent getaway with family, cool clean mountain air and away from the crowds of resorts such as Jackson or Park City. 4 children from 6 to 14 and no complaints from any of them. Great place to getaway. Make sure to spend the evening looking up at the stars."
229,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2016 , Solo,"Winchester, MA ",A great visit,"Can't ask for a nicer place. I am from Jackson and Jackson is steeper, but grand Targhee has hidden steep bits and super snow. Unfortunately I don't have any pictures."
230,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2016 , Couples,Columbia ,CAT Skiing at Grand Targhee,"I was fortunate to be able to get on one of the last CAT skiing trips of the 2015-2016 season. I had some experience skiing Teton Pass and wanted to try CAT skiing. The day I chose was quite windy. In fact Dream catcher lift did not go all day but the CAT trip did. I was very impressed with the organization. It was pretty blown off at the top due to the 50 mph winds, crusty 1/3 rd the way own and powdery in the trees. After one run Eric our head guide informed us if anyone did it want to ski they could return to the base and get a refund or reschedule. Targhee CAT skiing guarantees that the experience lives up to ones expectation or you get a do over. This is unheard of in the highly commercial CAT skiing world. This was my first time CAT skiing and I was the least experienced however I was supported by the staff and my fellow skiers. I had a great time and plan to do it again. It is an awesome experience and I highly recommend it."

239,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2016 , Family,"Casper, Wyoming ",What a blast!,Targhee is a great ski area and is really fun and family oriented. I just wish there were more and better lodging and dining options.
240,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2016 , Family,"San Diego, CA ","Spectacular views, quality skiing, and no crowds","This was a last-minute Spring Break trip and my 1st visit to Grand Targhee. Glad we chose this mountain, as it was affordable and it offered quality skiing in a stunning location late in the season.    We flew into Jackson Hole and rented a car -- much more affordable than the shuttles. The drive over the Teton Pass is beautiful, but can be a white-knuckle affair if it's snowing. Another option is to fly into Salt Lake and drive from there. We talked to a few who did this; it's 1.5 vs. 4 hours or so.    Grand Targhee is a small resort on a big mountain, and offers quite a bit for the money. We were 3, including a teenager, and for 4 nights/ 3 ski days we paid roughly what the lift tix would have cost us at any of the big resorts in Utah or the Sierras, or over the mountains at Jackson Hole. Our room in the Teewinot Lodge was fine -- basic and clean -- and it is steps from the plaza and lifts, where there were never any lines. This was definitely a spring ski trip, so the conditions were all over the place, but we woke up to a couple inches of powder on our last day and found some excellent spots where powder from previous storms was still untouched. Another highlight was hiking to Mary's Nipple, taking in the spectacular Teton views, and bouncing through the powder on the way down.    My only criticism would be for the lack of dining options. It's such a small resort that they probably can't sustain another restaurant, so I understand why there aren't more. But for dinner the only options are overpriced fine dining at the Branding Iron or bar food at the Trap Bar & Grill. At the latter, kids can only enter from 6-8:00. The food here isn't bad for what it is, and I have to say that the drink prices at both places were pretty attractive: a $3 local draft at the end of a ski day is a beautiful thing. For breakfast and lunch there are a couple other options, so that was fine. Tired of our dinner options, we ended up driving down to Driggs (15-20 min) and had an awesome meal at Teton Thai. Just the drive there at sunset is worth it -- we saw the Tetons sunlit as they broke through clouds, and also saw moose, elk, and a fox.    If you come here with kids, the tubing hill is a lot of fun. Had we stayed longer, we would have also taken advantage of the other activities such as snow shoeing and the sleigh ride.    I will definitely recommend Targhee to friends, and I'll ski here again as well."
241,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Reminderville, Ohio ",Grand Targhee,"Uncrowded slopes, slopes for all levels of skiing. Great price of lift tickets. Great views of the Tetons. friendly staff. Not much to do after lifts close."

The drive was about 3 hours. The kids (16,14, and 10) loved Targhee. Most of it was groomed and provided long, fast runs. Several small terraine parks- one in the kiddie area that ended up being a family favorite because it was less crowded. We were there on a wam, sunny spring day- everyone there seemed to be living it up and apres ski was already started when we arrived at 11am. The music cranking, bloody marys flowing, we even saw people skiing with beer in hand.  The view of the Tetons from the top and looking back over the plains in idaho were worth every penny.  This would be a fun weekend getaway. But any longer would be too long."

Unless of course you enjoy hand washing all the dishes from the previous occupant as well as yourself.    That said, Grand Targhee Ski Resort is a great mountain with a hometown vibe and friendly lift staff. I recommend you visit this slice of heaven, just don't stay in the condo unit we did."
250,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2016 , Family,"Cleveland, Ohio ",Great Place,"It is our favorite resort in the entire US! The mode in Grand Targhee is to relax, the fun stuff in the mountains is like no other. Great variation, some great easy hikes, and of course the best snowfall almost anywhere in the world. Bring as many people as you can so you have your own party, then enjoy all the wonderful laid back people that run the place. Lodging is not really nice, but acceptable. If you prefer the up tight skiers and offerings of Aspen or Vail (Which we frequent as well), the place may not be for you."
251,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2016 , Family,"Fairfax, VA ",Best skiing and reasonably priced!,We just came back from a great family vacation at Grand Targhee. It is a lot more budget friendly than Jackson Hole. The slopes were never crowded and the lift lines were never long. The trails are challenging for east coast skiers. My kids loved the ski school and our private instructor was great so we booked him for our entire trip. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. My kids loved the kids fun zone and there were many different levels for them to progress. My kids can't wait to go back next year and they wanted to stay longer.

With alpine skiing, cross country trails for classic & skate, snow shoeing, fat bike, etc. there are a lot of options.

We rented a townhouse through Grand Targhee in Driggs, Idaho, about 20-30 minute drive from there to the ski resort. Two adult lift tickets included for each day of our rental & kids skied free, a great value.

The mountain provided great terrain from groomed runs to steep chutes and everything in between. We were there with a large group of people which made it even more fun. The only issue that I can think of is everything closes early so if you're looking for a fun night life this isn't the place. As for me I was exhausted and after a soak in the hot tub and a good meal I was ready for bed anyway. Great time and great memories!

This resort has something for everyone, and is a complete contrast to Jackson Hole. We loved the beautifully groomed runs, green, mostly blue runs and a few challenging blacks if you are so inclined. The resort is very picturesque, with plenty of tree runs and spectacular views of the Tetons and best of all... no crowds and it is suitable for both boarders and skiers. Lift passes are reasonably priced and so is the mountain dining. The resort also offers good Nordic skiing as well as fat bike trails. We skied on a perfect sunny day and maybe we were just lucky. If you like hardcore stick to Jackson, but if you like a gentler pace, then try Grand Targhee, I am sure you won't regret it"

It was not crowded even though the snow conditions were outstanding. After skiing I would head to the Trap Bar have a few beers and ride the shuttle back to Driggs. Grand Targhee is a gem of a ski resort. I love the great snow, the laid back helpful staff and relaxed feeling. I really like the live web cams they have, which allow you to see the conditions as they are on the slopes and at the base. Can't wait to return."

280,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2016 , Friends,Verona ,Knowledge is Powder ski camp,"My friend and I finished last weekends ""Knowledge is Powder"" ski camp. We are both intermediate skiers living in the Midwest and we try and get out West 1-2 times per season. Over the years we have primarily skied blue and some black groomed trails and rarely have been lucky enough to have real powder days. I personally have always been uneasy skiing moguls, off piste, etc.  I had some apprehension about signing up for the 3 day camp and wondered if I would be slowing up the group. The first day we met Mark Hanson, the Director of the Targhee Ski and Snowboard School. Mark was our instructor for the entire 3 days. He is an amazing teacher and from start to finish was giving us tips on skiing different conditions.  The first day we met at the ski school and had a short yoga session with Helen, who has a yoga business in Driggs and is also one of the snow cat guides. This was followed by skiing groomers for the rest of that day and trying to learn the art of carving. The second day we started out with first tracks and had great conditions, progressing to some off piste instruction. The last day was supposed to be the cat trip, but we decided to just continue the instruction with Mark. Luckily, it snowed the entire night and we woke up to another first tracks morning with about 10 inches of new snow. What a blast! After first tracks, we spent the rest of the day again practicing skiing different conditions off piste. In addition to the instruction, the second and third days we stopped for a midmorning hearty breakfast that was also included in the package deal.  We also had a few snowboarders at the school, taught separately by Paul. He was also a great instructor with years of training and experience under his belt.  I believe the 3 day camp was a great experience and a great value as well. Lift tickets are included in the price, 2 days of first tracks, 2 breakfasts, a personal yoga session and dark chocolate from Mark on the lift to keep you going.  I didn't feel intimidated and feel Mark and his team could tailor the experience to the groups abilities. I left feeling I had made some real progress and am looking forward to my next ski trip. Maybe we will make this an annual trip. Thanks for everything Mark."
281,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2016 , Family,"Greater Sydney, Australia ",Absolutely fantastic day of Cat Skiing on fresh powder.,"We booked a day of cat skiing on-line for our recent ski holiday to Jackson Hole. I was slightly apprehensive about it when I didn't get much empathy in responses to my emails for transport options Teton Village to Grand Targhee. Basically they were, book a private cat, get accommodation at Grand Targhee, hire a car or get a private shuttle/taxi. All of these options added 30% or more to the cost of an already expensive day. Somewhat irritating when there is already a regular bus service that almost matches the ski cat times, but I was told in no uncertain terms the cat couldn't fit with that! Obviously greater demand than supply at the moment Grand Targhee? Something you may wish to look at.    Based on that alone, my rating would have been 1 or 2, but, my apprehension was blown away by the warm welcome and care taken by ""Scoop"", Eric and Doug, the crew we had on our cat. Between them they rescued the day and took it to just the greatest day of skiing I have experienced in 40 years. Certainly, the fresh powder helped but these guys are consummate professionals who know their stuff, love what they do and enjoy people.    We were a family group of my wife, twin 11yo boys and myself; all intermediate plus skiers. The boys got a bit tired after 6 runs and rode in the cat chatting with Doug, we were all cared for individually and I observed this across the total group going with us that day.    A fantastic experience for skiing families, I just hope the ""back office"" can lift to a similar standard of excellence and, maybe improve the logistics arrangements."
282,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2016 , Family,"Salt Lake City, Utah ",Grand Targhee Annual Ski Trip,"We have stayed and skied at Grand Targhee as a family for approx. the last 20 years. The skiing and ski conditions have always been excellent and we like the ability to affordably stay right on the mountain (ski-in, ski-out). I believe Grand Targhee has some of the best lift served powder skiing in the U.S. We live in SLC, Utah 30 to 40 minutes from 7 ski resorts but still do our annual trip to ""Ski the Ghee"" for the aforementioned reasons."

Limited dining options but what they have between Branding Irons and The Trap is more than enough. If your looking for GRADE A SNOW and less snob appeal this is your spot.
288,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2015 , Couples,"Williston, VT ",VT to WY via ID,"We stayed in Jackson and decided we were going to travel over the notch to Targhee. We arrived at the resort and it was pretty windy. There was only one lift open and we decided to stay anyway. It was a good way to be introduced to skiing in the west. We loved it. It reminded us of Mad River in VT. Even though we didn't have a lot of trail choices the skiing was perfect. The people were so sweet. Would go again in season to experience the whole mountain. If you have the opportunity to go .....make the trek. The drive, the towns and the mountain are all worth it."
289,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2016 , Couples,Pittsfield ,Great time!,"The mountain is awesome but very laid back . The ski School powder program was some of the best instruction that I have encountered in 50 years. The snow was amazing, real champagne powder. Yuo can ski the trees from almost any trail. The cat skiing program, although limited to 600 acres offered fresh tracks all day with wonderful terrain. The treed sections are a little tight and would benefit from glading."
290,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Denver, CO ","Great hill, small crowds","We are lucky enough to live in our own ski town, and were very excited to visit another ski resort, where we had not skied before. And it is safe to say - Targhee is an absolute gem. It is not a resort for frills, which I personally really enjoyed. We stayed at the Targhee Resort and knew what to expect for the room - nothing fancy, just a comfortable, clean place to sleep. The location absolutely can't be beat! The boot dryers in the room are a very nice touch. The beds are comfortable and the room was immaculate. The staff was very kind and informative during our stay. The absolute best part of the staff, though, was when they found and returned my ring! I thought I had lost it on the mountain and had given up hope of ever finding it, and I am so happy they found it! Thank you for the great level of service!"
291,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Pittsfield, MA ","Awesome ski area, fabulous powder lessons, great cat skiing","This mountain has varied terrain; great for all levels of skiers. Knowledge is Powder program was awesome. Low Student-teacher ratio makes for a lot of individual instruction. Video analysis is incredibly helpful. This program is perfect for people who are new to powder, as well as for experienced powder skiers. Head of ski school, Mark, is a terrific instructor, as is Carol. They are patient and mellow and worked with each person at their own level. Each day, we could see the difference in everyones skiing and level of confidence. This clinic also provides a great mountain tour. Cat skiing experience is second to none. The base village is well laid out. All amenities are within a few steps of the base area. Lots of vegetarian choices. Branding Iron food is quite good. Teewinot Lodge is an older property that is very well maintained, very clean. All the staff, from the reservations people to the ski school staff, to the restaurant wait staff, to the lift operators are all very friendly and very helpful and polite. The quality of the snow was excellent...champagne powder. We are definitely planning a return visit with multiple generations of the family."
292,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2015 , Family,"Oshawa, Ontario ",Ski vacation,It's a bit of a hike to get to but well worth the tranquility and beautiful scenery.  Not a busy zoo like most other ski resorts with everything you need right there in a self contained village
293,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2015 , Family,"Naples, Florida ",21 Inches of Powder in One Day,We had an awesome Christmas ski vacation at Grande Targhee! It snowed every day and one day we had twenty-one inches! Staying at the resort is so nice and convenient with our teenagers because we can all ski when we want to. We meet up here and there and the mountain is just big enough to keep you challenged but not so big that you worry about your kids.
294,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2016,not available,"Butler, Tennessee ","Ice, not much snow when there","Went because of powder claims. No snow while there (4 nights-last day about 1 in) so conditions were ice (or what I would call it). Big crowds on Holiday/weekend then thinned some,"
295,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2015,not available,"Woking, UK ",A hidden gem with great powder,Spend two days here whilst staying at Jackson Hole. The skiing is a bit more gentle which appealed to my wife but the powder was astonishing. It was so light it was effortless to ski through. The views from the top were magnificent. I'm used to skiing in Europe where the views are good but one is almost always surrounded by other mountains whereas here you have a fantastic vista that stretches for over a hundred miles. Then on the other side there's great views of the Tetons. The resort was very quiet even between Christmas and New Year so there were no lift lines. A hidden gem !
296,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2015 , Family,Pretoria ,Great Authentic Resort,Grand Targhee was a great authentic ski experience as an alternative to the large commercial ski resorts. The family members could also split up and chase individual favourites as the resort plaza was a relaxing gathering point without worries of somebody ending at the wrong rendezvous. Food and drinks were high quality and very good value for money. Beers actually cost same as at home. Even though we did not get fresh powder in three days it was more than enough and we found many spots with good powder.

It was truly the hidden gem until Ski magazine did a write up. The staff has consistently been A+++ to everyone they serve. The ski instructor are patient, kind, and really work with kids. The ski patrol constantly keeps up with the slopes and watch over skiers and boarders to assure safety. The slopes this year are amazing. We have had 30 inches just this week to add to the overall base.    We have also been here during the summer. There is plenty of hiking, frisbee golf, and amazing mountain biking for all levels. Also the views around Alta as you drive up give a view of the Grand Tetons that are unique to the West view."
308,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2015 , Couples, ,A beautiful Family Ski Resort and More!,"I am finally writing this review on Grand Targhee SkI Resort now that I have visited in both seasons. I am splitting up the review for summer and winter season to help.    Winter: Overall the resort is a great family ski resort that is less costly than its counter part in Jackson and it gets more snow! I am guessing these are the reasons why it is regularly highly ranked with the best ski resorts within the United States. While it is not located in a ""ski town"" it seems that the resort is involved with a local community about 20 minutes away (Driggs). I like this sort of thing because it shows that the ski resort is actively trying to help the community as well. One example is the downtown store they have. Having family in the military I do also appreciate the discount they offer. The runs on the slope are mostly blue which I find are great. They offer ""snow-cat"" runs and the staff has always been friendly whenever we have interacted with them. It does get foggy up there sometimes so wear the right type of goggles and you should be good. When it is clear though the resort is beautiful, with tons of snow and the views of the tetons are amazing.    Summer: In the summer the resort focuses on festivals and mountain bikes. We have gone to the resort prior to the festivals and it is pretty cool. They set up a spot for trailers and then they have a massive stage with artists performing. I have heard good things about the bike trails, but have never gone myself. Other than that the resort has a disc golf course."
309,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2015 , Business,"Jackson, WY, ",The best!,"As much as other resorts have superior terrain, the runs here have tremendous variety! But the snow coverage is what truly Rocks. Being on the western or windward side of the Teton range coupled with having a base elevation of 7,860 feet above sea level means deeper snow; conditions similar to Jackson hole mountain resorts mid mountain at its bottom. Not only that, the place is still a single business, family style entity, lacking the mind numbing commercialism found so commonly in this field. It is a destination worth traveling a bit to find."
310,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2015 , Friends,"Columbus, GA ",First time skiing... excellent resort,"I was a first time skiier. A friend recommended Targhee. I was really impressed with Targhee. Not knowing anything about skiing or having any equipment, I took advantage of the ski school and equipment rental that is on site. Both were professional and courteous.    The learning area was excellent. Nice and roomy place to learn with no worry about running into others. The instructor had me up on the first lift just before lunch! I was amazed that I could ski down the mountain so soon, wow! Of course I still needed more training and practice, so I took a couple more days of lessons and got to know the beginner lift pretty well. The instructors were patient and knowledgeable.    Our room was clean and comfortable. And housekeeping was very friendly.    A few dining options are on site. A little pricey, but not too bad. It is a resort after all, so expect to tip generously.    We took the shuttle service to/from the Jackson Hole airport. The drivers were on time and courteous and safe. Was nice not to have to worry about renting a car and driving ourselves."

The accommodations (we stayed in a GT managed property on Ski Hill Rd, convenient to both resort and town of Driggs) and amenities we were able to take advantage of during our brief visit through Thanksgiving week were better than we could have expected. Ski lesson, mountain conditions, and guided snowshoe walk were all top-notch. The shuttle was convenient and fun; and the full moon over the Grand Tetons contributed to a magical experience."

325,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Prescott Valley, AZ ",Nice,"The G.T. is a great resort if you are into sports. Unfortunately, my hubby and I aren't. We stayed there because we wanted to be close to the Grand Tetons. Don't get me wrong, the place is beautiful and our room had a gorgeous view. If we went during the winter and liked to ski, we probably would have enjoyed it more. As it was there was a bike rally going on, so that was interesting to watch. But the only restaurant open for dinner was kind of expensive, so we opted to go into ""town"" (such as it is) for Italian instead. The G.T. has a nice pool, and the ski lift was running so we rode that to get the view. And the staff was exceptional. We might go back during the ski season just for the ambience, but there are places closer to the entrance to Grand Teton national park in Jackson itself that don't make you do the 90 minute (one way) drive. But for a once in a life time experience, it was nice."
326,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",Great summer day,The resort has a naturalist on staff. She has a hut at the top of the chair lift. It is full of books and displays. There are programs too all to help people learn about the plants and animals in the area. Apparently this position was required by the forest service as part of the resort's permit. I hiked with one of the former naturalists this summer. Both past and current staff were very knowledgeable and friendly. As a huge bonus (thanks to a tip from the staff) we saw a pair of mountain blue birds nesting in the upper cross bar of one of the lift towers. They are beautiful birds.

328,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jan 2015 , Family,"Boise, ID ",Great Skiing,"Grand Targhee Ski Resort is a wonderful mid-sized ski resort. There are no large towns nearby so it is rare that the lift lines are more than 5 minutes long. The whole of the resort boasts of wonderful powder and they receive over 40 feet (500 inches) annually, much of it coming in overnight storms. Many visitors come to Grand Targhee to get away from the poor conditions at Jackson Hole."
329,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Grants Pass, OR ",A real High Point of our trip (Pun intended and completely true!),"This review is of the chair lift up the mountain.    I love high country and mountain scenic views. But at my age and shape arduous climbing is beyond me.    The Grand Teton Mountains of northwest Wyoming and southwest Idaho offer some of the most spectacular views in North America. Our accommodation was in Victor, Idaho, near Jackson Hole, at the Fox Creek Inn. The manager after discussing our interests especially recommended the chair lift at the Grand Targhee Resort out of Driggs, Idah, about 10 miles away. As you go up the access road you cross into Wyoming.    The resort is intended primarily for skying and snowboarding in winter, and mountain biking in summer. We were told that the biking was considered world class.    In any case, we bought lift tickets to ride to the top. The lift appeared to be in first class condition, and had helpful attendants at each end. The ride took perhaps fifteen minutes each way and lifted us I believe about 3000 feet to a point very near the top of a ridge. A very helpful guide in the visitor center at the top of the lift welcomed us and gave us excellent information. Behind the center started a rocky trail up about an additional fifty feet higher to the summit of the ridge. Climbing poles were available for loan for those needing them.    When we topped out about five minutes later, all I can say is that the views were absolutely stunning, of the Grand Tetons and a grand panorama of the area. To say they were breathtaking would also be entirely accurate, but climbing a 50 foot steep trail at 9,000 feet perhaps had something to do with that.    We stayed for perhaps 45 minutes before time constraints of our schedule forced us to head down. This was an experience I will especially treasure to the end of my days."
330,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Charleston, SC ",Recommended side trip while you're in the area,"We visited during the summer and are pleased we did! This is a beautiful, peaceful place. There are lots of mountain bikers (not us), and a great chair lift that takes you to the back part of the Tetons. Beautiful! You can hike, you can stroll, you can admire the wildflowers, and you can enjoy some coffee and food when you return to the base. We thought it was worth the trip for a relaxing and enjoyable afternoon."
331,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Austin, TX ",Visited in the summer - biking mecca,"So we don't downhill ski - and we don't mountain bike. With that disclosure, this place was much smaller than I expected. Just a couple restaurants and a couple shops with a parking lot and some lifts!

We found so much more than that. The resort has an extensive network of hiking trails, well-maintained and covering a variety of different terrains and skill levels, as well as chairlift rides to the top of the mountain, and an impressive bike rental program for the many bike trails on the ski mountain. We also discovered a robust naturalist program and took advantage of it to walk around exploring the geology, flora, and fauna of the nearly 10,000 foot top of the mountain with a trained naturist. We only had two days free for our experience, but we could have stayed for a week. Great people, terrific scenery, plenty of recreational opportunities. A wonderful surprise."
335,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Jul 2015 , Family,"Barrington, IL ",Summer walk down the mountain - stunning views.,"Ride up on a ski lift for $15. Once off there is a trail on the ridge line that showcases the Tetons in al their glory. Then take the Bannock trail down. Takes about 1.5 hours to walk. Trail is a bit rough, yet no problem if you take it slow. Wild flowers in mid July were in full bloom. The whole mountainside was alive with color. There are steep drop offs and loose rock. The trail is plenty wide and safe as long as you are paying a little attention. At the bottom there is a small restaurant with surprisingly good food. Worth the effort."

Views were beautiful, people were friendly, lines were small and we were there on a holiday weekend. Was way worth it!!! Lots of fresh snow and fun!"
337,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2015 , Friends,"Calgary, Canada ",The awesome local alternative to Jackson Hole,"Want something a bit more laid back? With some lifts from the 60s? It is smaller, with less vertical, and not as steep as Jackson, but that adds to the charm. Leave the crowds behind and explore this gem. If I was a local I would make Targhee my resort of choice."
338,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Dec 2014 , Friends, ,excellent terrain for families/groups,"Grand Targhee usually has better snow and more of it than other ski areas in the vicinity. The way the mountain is laid out, it is easy to ride the lifts to the top and everyone can make their own way down on separate runs, then meet at the bottom to ride the chair together again. There is plenty of challenging terrain but most is accessed via a hike and will require a transceiver, shovel and partner. Glades, bowls, cruisers, Targhee has something for everyone.    Good amenities at the base area. Cat skiing available at an additional expense. Great place to learn powder skiing."
339,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Apr 2015 , Family,Banff ,Friendly Resort- Lacks Challenging Terrain- You will love it if you are an intermediate skier,"Just got back from 4 days at Grand Targhee. On the upside the conditions were good and the staff and people we met were lovely. Great resort for BLUE skiers but after 4 hours of of skiing blue we were bored. If you are a middle of the road skier and like to ski the same fall line over and over on blue runs- you will love it. For those of use who are looking for more challenge - skip it. The only challenging terrain is closed or a hike ( a long hike ) and at 10,000 feet you should be fit and able to do so. Bring your transceiver and avalanche gear to hit the back country you will have more fun."
340,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2015 , Family,"Idaho Falls, ID ",Wow - This place is awesome,"GT is one of the best ski resorts in the intermountain west. If you are looking for great snow, lots of terrain, and small lift lines this is the place. The mountain is awesome. There are lots of groomers but the best skiing is everywhere else. I just wish my legs were stronger."
341,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2015 , Friends,"washington,dc ",Amazing Spring Skiing,"Came here from Jackson on March 20th. Great spring skiing, hanging outside with a beer on a beautiful sunny day. Nice folks all around."
342,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2015 , Friends,"Shenzhen, China ",Incredibly beautiful resort,"This resort is simply stunning. Amazing views over the Grand Tetons, fantastic tree runs and a lovely atmosphere. Really glad that we visited."
343,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2015 , Friends,"Toronto, Canada ",Targhee Express day visit to Grand Targhee,"Our ski group from Toronto was staying in Jackson, and a day trip was arranged though Targhee Express. We had outstanding service through the whole day. The bus was on time, comfortable... And Jessie, the bus driver and tour guide extraordinaire was entertaining, knowledgeable, always willing to accommodate our members.  Unfortunately, one of our skiers was injured and Jessie was understanding and flexible; he readily agreed to delay our departure by 30 minutes and stop at the hospital one the way back to Jackson. Many members commented throughout the day about our wonderful guide/driver."
344,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Mar 2015 , Couples,"Bend, OR ",Grand Targhee is more than grand!,"We had a GREAT ski experience for our first visit to Grand Targhee Ski Resort!!! Some friends also opted to join us after leaving a Utah resort, and THEY loved it as well. We all extended our stay to ski in fresh snow another day or two. The resort staff were more than accommodating from reservations weeks before (we got a ski free, 1 night free deal), to the extension of our time when the snow fell. Our rooms at Teewinot Lodge were spacious and comfortable with good beds and towels, a nice flatscreen TV, nice views. I like the electric baseboard heat as it's quick and quiet; it was quiet for sleeping too. What is dated for sure are the bathrooms. I believe the Teewinot Lodge is the nicest (and more expensive) of the several lodging facilities--the rooms in a lodge our friend stayed in were less spacious but fine for a shorter stay they said. Queen beds only (our room had two, which is fine). We LOVED the proximity of the lodging/food/bar/ski lifts and it all felt so comfortable and easy to manage (be sure to utilize the free ski storage)! For the few food options available due to the resort size, we had no complaints and would give very good reviews of what we ate. The breakfasts and coffee/chai from Snorkels was quite filling (my husband LOVED the burritos--especially the El Hefe, made fresh by Mexican chefs to order); the Trap Bar had good bar food and then some real specials (good wings on wing night and tacos on taco night--yum!)--we would advise a better wines by glass offering. The food quality at the Branding Iron was excellent, both for lunch and dinner. We had 3 lunches there--I loved the salad bar with homemade soups. My husband had a burger that he raved about. Great Idaho tater tots or fries too! Our prime rib dinner was excellent--generous portions cooked perfectly. Our friend had shrimp and grits that she loved--lots of beautiful shrimp.  Another pleasant surprise--we heard excellent free live music at the Trap Bar 4 of the days (3-6pm) we were there.It was fun to hang there after skiing and experience the apres ski with those that skied til the end of day. Great vibe there! Also fun ski videos and current sports on the several TVs. Service at all restaurants was excellent. OH--the SKIING!! AWESOME--we all loved the mountain, excellent groomers, long steep runs, virtually no lift lines, and incredible acreage available--all skiable. We could hardly believe all that was available with 3 main lifts (Dreamcatcher, Blackfoot, Sacajawea)! When we got the near foot of light powder, we had a ball for 2 days :) Our group has been to a lot of 'ski hills' and resorts (we are not extreme, 'only powder' skiers...) and we REALLY like this resort!"
345,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2015 , Friends,"Los Angeles, CA ",Targhee Express (All Trans) Transport and Guide,"Our Fountain Valley Ski Club enjoyed a snow day at Grand Targhee courtesy of Targhee Express deal ($99 lift ticket and bus ride) from Jackson. The snow was amazing and the terrain varied but we totally made out with the personal guide treatment of our bus driver Jesse! He toured a group of us (12 people) all over the mountain taking us to places we never would have found on our own.    Jesse made the trip to Grand Targhee for the Intermediate and above skiers in our group of 32. The snow was perfect, the weather typical (slightly clouded in) and the temperature just right. We whisked down the mountain run after run. Before noon we had hit 60% of the blue runs on our non-stop top to bottom marathon skiing. Legs were burning but the snow was so great we just couldn't stop.. and kept opting for one more before we finally headed in for a nice sit-down lunch in the resorts slope side dining room.    If you find yourself in Jackson and want a 'local' big mountain experience with wide open and varied terrain then give Grand Targhee a shot and if you are luck enough to have Jesse as your driver -- ski with the guy. You'll have fun!"
346,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2015 , Couples,"Seattle, WA ",Targhee Express - Round trip bus from Jackson,"Targhee is an outstanding area - no surprise to anybody who skis. If you are staying in Jackson and skiing Jackson Hole take a day over at Targhee. We used and strongly recommend the Targhee Express. You get a round trip bus ride, which picks up at various stops around town, a lift ticket and if you are lucky enough to get Jeff DuPont as a driver you have a built in mountain guide...all for $99. Very professionally run, on time (can be a rare thing in a ski town) and Jeff really was the icing on the cake. You will not be disappointed."
347,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2015 , Family,"Palmer, AK ","Fun, big ski hill","There is a ton of terrain and something for everyone here. I loved that I could ski from the top and take gentle runs all the way down. The runs are really wide, so there are no bottle-necks. There wasn't any new snow when we were there, but it was still really fun. There is a high-speed quad from the base of the mountain that opens up many runs. I skied the Nordic trails one day after a full ski day. The trails are amazing and well-groomed, but the elevation was a little tough on my sea-level lungs. I would love to return and ski again when better acclimated."
348,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2015 , Couples,"Livonia, MI ",Great Place,"The snow wasn't the best when we were here, but still better than what we have experienced in Utah and Colorado recently. The runs are great, very wide open and pretty steep, and you can pretty much ski anywhere. The trees are wide open. We were only here for a day, but are planning a return for several days. There were no crowds on a Sunday. We never waited in a lift line and there were several bars at the base to have a drink."
349,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2015 , Couples,"Annapolis, MD ",Awesome Place!,We skied here three times while staying in Jackson and it was well worth the hour drive. The lines are small so you truly get a full day of skiing. The trails were well groomed and there were trails for all abilities. Being able to ski off trail through powder at many places was a lot of fun. The people working at the resort were very friendly. I would ski here again!
350,Grand_Targhee_Ski_Resort,Feb 2015 , Solo,"Mundelein, IL ",Alltrans/Gray Line Targhee Express from Jackson Hole to Grand Targhee,"Hello fellow skiers and boarders:  A trip to Jackson Hole Ski Resort would not be complete without an Alltrans/Grayline Express Bus trip and ski day with Jesse O'Connor. Jesse was our driver and doubled as a fun mountain guide. The Grand Teton Pass is absolutely beautiful and is the steepest pass (10% Grade) in the United States! Jesse is a fun guy and certainly has a great career as a tour guide for the Jackson Hole, Yellowstone and Grand Targhee area! There is so much history here and it is good to have someone who knows it and delivers it with an entertaining story line. The skiing at Grand Targhee and Jackson Hole offer excellent terrain for all skier/boarder levels. The views of the Grand Teton Mountain Range are absolutely spectacular!"
