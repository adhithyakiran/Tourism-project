0,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2021,not available, ,Absolutely o Covid precautions,"It’s almost as if they ever heard of COVID. They pack you in to every seat, with no effort to social distance. Nobody wears a mask, and no effort was made to request patrons to wear one. I understand the performers couldn’t wear one, it at least 98% of the people watching weren’t wearing one. We were so uncomfortable we couldn’t wait to leave"
1,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2021 , Family,"Hatfield, Pennsylvania, United States ",Awesome!,"Had a wonderful evening here! It was a nice change from all the hiking and outdoor activities to simply sit and be entertained. Food was great, and the show was wonderful. (7 Brides for 7 Brothers). Highly recommend!"
2,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2021,not available,"Cincinnati, OH ",Superb Acting,"While we don't go to the play that often, attending Seven Brides for Seven Brother was a great call. Acting and director were superb. They did a great job, especially when you consider the limited resources. After a number of days in a row of sightseeing, hiking , fighting crowds for dinner - it was nice to have an laid back enjoyable time at the theater. At intermission, one of the actors in play will sell you booze which you can bring back into theater..."
3,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2021,not available,New York ,Fantastic dinner theater,We loved our evening at the Playhouse. The dinner was delicious and it was fun to have the wait staff sing during the meal. The show was fabulous. It is a small setting with outstanding actors. We loved it.
4,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2021 , Family, ,"Great show, great laughs!","Excellent! Great family fun, good music, talent, staging, lots of laughs and incredible slow motion. Fight scene! Plus it was a good price too! Our family loved it! Thank you for a great night Jackson playhouse! We hope to come back soon!"
5,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2021 , Family,Kentucky ,Go here if you can,This was a fantastic evening! The actors were excellent. We laughed the whole time. My youngest daughter said this was the best play that she’d ever seen. We saw Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.
6,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2021,not available,"Greensboro, NC ","Close quarters, but an entertaining show","Dinner was good if not spectacular, but that's optional in any case. They do offer some live singing by the cast during dinner, which keeps things fun. The show itself was a blast - great acting, fun, and really engaging. Worth an evening of your time in Jackson. Only downside to seeing the show in summer is the venue lacks AC or much ventilation, and they pack in the audience. Combined with a nearly 3-hour runtime (including intermission) and mid-summer it gets pretty stifling."
7,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2021 , Family, ,Fun evening in Jackson for families!,"We did the meal and show option. Our whole family (boys ages 14 and 11) loved the food and show. Highly recommend. Lots of laughing, talented group!"
8,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2021,not available,New York ,Highly Entertaining Family Fun,"Fun and entertaining evening at the Jackson Hole Playhouse. Great family fun. The entire family (including the kids, aged 11, 9 and 7) really enjoyed watching 7 Brides for 7 Brothers. . The theater is small, the actors are energetic and engaging. You'll laugh out loud and be entertained the entire evening."
9,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2021,not available,"loomis, United States ",Amazing acting,"We visited here at the end of June 2021 and based on the reviews we went. We LOVE plays and this did NOT dissappoint. Our 3 adult children 18,20,22 loved it as well. We were laughing so hard at one point we were crying! The ""Slow Mo"" part is hilarious and I was quite impressed with the acting. These young adults come from ALL over to spend a summer/fall here acting. The piano player was AMAZING. And our family Loves the theatre, so we were a hard sell. Did not go to the dinner had a nice dinner for 100$ in town vs 225$ at the playhouse.... This was one of my favorite memories of our trip. We plan to visit again ..."
10,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2021 , Family,"Tacoma, WA ",Family Fun,"Highly recommend during your Jackson visit. We watched a performance of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The theater is intimate and has a unique old-west feel. The performance was excellent - from the talented and hilarious cast to the impressive playing by the piano player. The entire family (from my teenage daughter who is obsessed with theater and musicals, to my boys aged 12 and 7 who thought they were in for a dull night of theater) couldn’t stop talking about all of their favorite parts of the performance. Hands down would do this next time we are in town."
11,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2021 , Family,Georgia ,If you want to have a fun night then go!,Our family of four (kids aged 18 and 16) loved this show tonight. It was very funny and the music and acting was exceptional. It was the perfect ending of our week here visiting Yellowstone and the Tetons. Our family agrees that this was one of the highlights of our trip. It definitely added to the total experience!!! We definitely recommend!!!
12,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2021,not available, ,Fun evening,The cast of 7 brides for 7 brothers was excellent. Had a really fun night. Be prepared to be very close to the seat next to you! It's crammed and pretty warm inside.
13,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2021 , Family,"San Diego, CA ",Great Playhouse and Show,"We started our Jackson Hole trip by going to the JH playhouse on our first night (which was their opening night). I am not a theater person and I had an amazing time. The show, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, was very entertaining and the dancing was so good and very well choreographed. We did the dinner at the playhouse before and enjoyed the show done by the actors who were our servers. While part of the cast served dinner, other members are out doing the gunfight in the town square. These people and the playhouse are the heart of Jackson, WY. You must go there if you are visiting Jackson."
14,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2021 , Friends,"Jackson Hole, WY ",Best show and talent in the West.,Once again the Jackson Hole Playhouse is amazing. We are regulars and the food and entertainment is the best. Connor my 24 year son with Down Syndrome is a part of the Playhouse family. Kind and welcoming. We attend 3-4 times every summer.
15,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2021 , Couples,"Farmington, UT ",Beyond spectacular,"This year my family decided that for our reunion it would just be the siblings and our spouses along with our sweet mother and her great husband.    We attended 7 brides for 7 brothers. Needless to say the entire experience was beyond sensational. Vicki the owner was beyond accommodating and the entire staff was attentive to our every need and were fantastic to interact with.    The food was sensational and the play was as good as I’ve seen. And I have been blessed to see world class productions in New York, Cleveland and Chicago and Oakley Idaho 😉    Society needs more of these types of businesses. Thank you Jackson Hole Playhouse for making our family reunion so special."

17,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2021 , Family, ,EVEN MY LITTLE KIDS LOVED IT!,"We saw Seven Brides for Seven Brothers tonight, and it even kept my seven year old son’s attention. My three year old did really well, too. This was a highlight of our trip, and we will definitely be back. Thanks to the cast and crew for an amazing night that will last in our memories forever."
18,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Feb 2021,not available,"WATERFORD, Connecticut ",Fun Night at the Theater!,"Great little theater in Jackson Hole! Way overpriced.. but fun if your looking for something to do. The food was ok - drinks good, and the entertainment was fun. Don't go expecting to see a Broadway show.. it's more of a fun, entertaining evening."
19,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Dec 2020 , Couples, ,A MUST SEE,This was a pleasant surprise. We love musicals and have seen many over the years and never expected to see this kind of talent and quality in this small town. A DEFINITE must when visiting Jackson Hole
20,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Orlando, FL ",Highly recommend,"Amazing show. Talented cast. Would highly recommend! Just one warning - despite The Playhouse asking customers multiple times to wear face coverings and exit in an orderly fashion after the show, many people seemed to forget about the pandemic and exited as a herd without a face covering."
21,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2020,not available,"Southern Shores, NC ",Great night of entertainment,Everything was excellent. From the steak dinner to the singing waiters to the show itself we were very impressed. The playhouse has taken great pains to establish social distancing even in the theater and we felt very comfortable a s a result.
22,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2020 , Solo,"Austin, TX, ",So talented!,I just got back from seeing The Ballad of Cat Ballou & was blown away by the incredibly talented singing/dancing/acting troupe. Excellent staging & choreography.    Yes it’s silly & slap sticky but it’s VERY well done.    Every other row is blocked off. You book online & when you choose your seats the seats on either side are automatically blocked off. They sanitize the seats each night.    You can buy tickets just for the show or make it a fun evening & get the dinner too.    The lobby sells fresh popcorn & cookies!    Plenty of free parking around the place.
23,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2020 , Friends,Wisconsin ,Unbelievable Cast Talent,"Wow, I just left the show The ballad of Cat Ballou and CAN NOT say enough about the acting, dancing and singing talent each and every actor possessed. I literally and figuratively sat at the edge of my seat because I didn’t want to miss a thing. Very witty humor with well timed satire. I’ve traveled around the world, experienced operas, broadway plays and been to Moulin Rouge and plays that attract National Talent and this was by far the best I’ve experienced. Go see this show."
24,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2020,not available,"Oceanside, CA ",DON'T MISS OUT! THIS IS A MUST SEE / MUST DO EXPERIENCE!!!,"FANTASTIC FUN, INCREDIBLY TALENTED ARTISTS - FUN! FUN! FUN! GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!! Listen, if you go to Jackson and you miss the playhouse, you messed up! This is the highlight of our trip! We've visited 3 times and 3 times went to the playhouse and would NEVER go to JH and miss going to the playhouse. Even if they are doing the same play/musical...it's ALWAYS fun, fresh and frolicking great entertainment!"
25,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Corpus Christi, TX ",Dinner and a Show...A Must See!!,"My wife and I took my parents and had a great time!! Carson was very informative and an excellent host! The food was great and the service was top notch! The show was very impressive...the acting, dancing and singing were all more than we expected! A great evening well spent!"
26,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2020,not available, ,Great Community Theater,"Just saw the show tonight, WOW1 This is what community theater is supposed to be like, fun, entertaining, great presentation and it appeared the cast was having fun doing the performance.    The musical, songs and dancing was entertaining and uplifting."
27,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2020 , Couples,east texas ,Wild West Culture,"I have really wanted to see this performance from the time I began planning our vacation. I remember The Ballad of Cat Ballou as a kid and I was dying to see this production. The performance was fabulous, the actors were incredibly talented. The old historical building itself was something to see! I loved the bit of history of the building/Playhouse they told prior to the show. I absolutely it loved and so did my boyfriend!! performance while you’re town. I actually pulled in at the very last minute, right before show time, as I already had prior reservations to the Bar-T-5 Chuckwagon dinner (which I also recommend) it was the only night I could squeeze in either of the activities on my trip and both worked out fine so that I was able to do both! Due to my prior activity, I didn’t have dinner at the theater, but I do hear they serve a fabulous dinner as well before showtime. The Playhouse lends such culture and a wild west ambience to the town and area. The Jackson Hole area is incredibly lucky to have such a wonderful community partner. The entire cast, performance and venue were all most certainly impressive! This was a “can’t miss” activity for me! I definitely recommend catching a performance if possible. Thank you, Jackson Hole Playhouse for making my trip such a memorable one ! This was such a fun night!!!"
28,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2020 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",Fantastic night out!,"SO GOOD! The meal was 5-star, worth every penny! The peach compote on the cornish hen was fabulous, and the chocolate cake may be the best I have ever eaten. The wait staff (cast) were amazing - we loved every moment. And the show was fantastic as well. Exceptional singing and dancing, and we haven't laughed that hard in a long time! Thanks, Kit Balou cast, for making the last night of our vacation so memorable!"
29,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2020,not available,"Henefer, UT ",Disappointed in the dinner,"We were excited to see the play and enjoy the dinner. The play, ""Ballad of Cat Balou"" was fun and the actors were great. Beautiful voices and wonderful choreography. The dinner, on the other hand was not what we had expected. The food was just OK...We had ordered on line. We had the surprise of paying an additional 20% gratuity after paying $40 per plate for food that was not worth that. Also, after paying the 20% gratuity, they asked us to pay even more for the entertaining waiters. (What was the 20% gratuity for? Not the singing waiters????) Needless to say, this additional cost was not expected. I would attend the play again but NEVER have the meal."
30,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2020 , Couples,"Farmington, UT ",Amazing dinner and show,"Such a great time! The dinner was amazing, and as you ate the staff would sing to entertain. After dinner you go to the theater for the show. The performances were outstanding! We loved it"
31,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2020,not available,"Council Bluffs, IA ",A must to see,A must activity to do in Jackson Hole. There is not a better way to spend a night  than going to see a play. The show was fantastic. So glad I went. Will add it to my  list of things to do there. Great family fun.
32,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2020,not available,"Brooklyn, NY ",great show and food,"Visited with friends. Had dinner and show experience. Food was good in a very atmospheric surroundings, the waiters suddenly started singing - lots of fun. The show is very professional, funny and unique. Unfortunately, the room was half empty due to covid."
33,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2020 , Friends,"Edwardsville, KS ",Dinner and a show,"This was so worth the money and time! We experienced both the dinner and the show. Good food, great wait staff and a fantastic show."
34,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2020 , Family,"Denver, CO ",Don’t miss this!,"Just awesome! The show was top notch, music was fantastic and food was great too! All around super fun night for the family, highly recommend!"
35,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2020 , Couples, ,"Totally worth it, you should go!",We decided to do this last minute and we sure are happy we did! It was so much fun! We had dinner and watched the show. Our waitress was Nikole who was also the narrator of the show. So much fun!
36,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2019,not available,"Fort Scott, Kansas, United States ",I Laughed my @&$ off.,"I'd go back to Jackson Hole for many reasons. The food was fair, the service was good, the play was worth the cost. I'd go again."
37,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Dec 2019,not available, ,"Unbelievable, so good went three times!!!",I was so impressed with this years XMas show I brought three different groups to see it!!! Each performance was more enjoyable than the previous. I especially appreciated the level of professionalism and pure talent of each individual of the five member cast. Distinctly different yet not a weak link to be found. The blending of voices was exquisite. The flawless execution. Every time my dining mates were delighted with joy at the deliciousness of their meals. The friendliness and quality of personal attention of our actor/servers always impresses me. Humility amongst such talent is personally humbling. We are above and beyond fortunate to be blessed with productions of this caliber in our little mountain town.
38,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jan 2020,not available,"O'Neill, NE ","Bad food, poor service, performance wasn't worth cost.","I waited 15 min to be seated and was elbow to elbow with the person next to me. I waited 10 more min before my drink order was taken and at least 20 min before I was served my drink (1 bartender for around 60 people.) My salad was sitting on the table when I sat down so the lettuce had started to wilt. My steak was to be cooked medium but it was rare and poor tasting My side was cold. Dessert was ok, but certainly not worth the $9 in addition to the $12 drink made with cheap alcohol. I asked for a napkin since I didn't get one and waited 20 minutes for it. The show was decent, but definitely not worth the cost. The owner told me I needed to sit at a 90 degree angle due to fire regulations. This required me to have to crank my neck to watch the show. Seating was a wooden bar stool so I was uncomfortable for 4 hours. It was hot in the space. Even the actors were even sweating. There was no lighting in the bathrooms. The woman next to me said the breaker flipped but the manager didn't do anything to fix the situation. When my waitress brought me my bill for my drink and dessert, she had written another total at the top and pointed out that it was my total for the entire evening that included the price I'd already paid for the show and my meal. She pointed out this was the amount that I was to tip based upon and toldl me the minimum suggested tip was 20%. I gave a $100 bill for my $19 total and the waitress looked at the $100 bill and asked if I would need change. Unbelievable!"
39,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Dec 2019 , Couples,"Hillsboro, OR ",VERY DISAPPOINTING. Waste of $$$$$$,"Do not eat here. Food almost not edible.  Salad already at place setting. Warm and wilted, not fresh. Only offer two dressings, both nasty. VERY limited main menu options. Only one option sounded interesting to my wife and I. The NY steak. Both steaks were so tough and full of gristle, they couldn’t be cut or chewed.  The pasta was bland and pasta sauce like water.  We couldn’t eat either meal they were so bad.  We were seated at the ‘bar’. Well, they don’t really have a bar. As they serve very few options of drinks.  I did order a local beer that was cold and flavorful.  Bartender never asked to refill my beer. We had to ask multiple times for ice water. Poor service for sitting right in front of him.  The place is so crowded you might as well be sitting on your neighbor’s lap.  So crowded that a guest cannot possibly get to the restroom. I wonder what would happen during a fire (?)  I had paid in full a couple months in advance, otherwise we would have left before we got started.  The show was funny/entertaining, but seemed like nothing more than a high school play. The website is outdated. The menu is outdated, the description outdated, the photos outdated. Misleading to say the least.  A couple of the hosts/cast were more than friendly, the bartender not so much, the couple of others I didn’t interact with so I’m not sure.  My wife and I were both very disappointed and felt ripped off.    I had emailed the company of my concerns and options the next day.  I did get an initial response but with no offer of remedy. I replied to them in hopes of a refund or at least a partial for the dinner portion. No response back and it’s been over a week.    There are so many great places to eat and be entertained in Jackson, this is NOT one of them. It’s unfortunate because the idea of dinner and a show is a good one. But this one falls way short of expectations.    Do not waste your money or time on this place at all. A true disappointment of time and over 200.00 invested."
40,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Dec 2019 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",Fun evening for the entire family,"Attended the Christmas dinner theater offering and had a blast! The Jackson Hole Playhouse is essentially a community theater production with dinner before the show. It is a family owned, family operated business that takes pride in patrons enjoying themselves. The meal offers several choices of entrees. all prepared well and served quickly. The servers/waitstaff take time to visit with guests and ensure that the meal and drinks are satisfactory. What you don't know at first is that they are also the performers for the evening. The production follows the conclusion of the meal. While the performance isn't Broadway, it is very much a sincere effort by every performer; you can sense their desire to be truly entertaining and that makes this community theater setting very personal. There may even be a little audience participation, as there was tonight, but it's all in good fun. Attending a dinner theater at the Jackson Hole Playhouse could easily be overlooked with the emphasis on outdoor recreation here, but this is a great way to spend an evening after a day on the slopes or on the river."
41,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Oct 2019,not available,"Meridian, ID ",Jackson Hole Playhouse,"Do not eat dinner here. When I was taken to my table the salad was already on the table. It was warm and wilted. It then took a full hour to get my main dinner. When I received my meal, it was cold, the mashed potatoes were extremely lumpy and the carrots were under cooked. The waitress never refilled my drink and they don't serve alcohol. The seating is so cramped that the other tables interrupted my conversations due to it was like being at the same table. The play was entertaining with good talent but it was like a high school play. The venue is old and needs updated. The speakers didn't work well."
42,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2019 , Friends, ,Big river,"As locals this was our first visit to the playhouse, and unfortunately had to leave at the intermission so did not get to watch the entire show. I was impressed with the actor, story line, and the interaction. Great fun! Am looking forward to going back to catch the entire show. Very enjoyable, will be back to watch the whole thing next week."
43,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Bardstown, KY ",Jackson Hole Playhouse,"Had a great time! Good was excellent & show was well done! Cast members were very talented, especially Madison & David!"
44,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2019,not available,Michigan ,Playhouse for a great time!!,"The show was great!! Don't miss it! The food was ok but not great, the deserts were really bad.  We would recommend to go to the show only and eat at Wyoming Inn In town!! great restaurant that is very quiet inside and no wait!!"
45,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2019 , Family,"Brainerd, MN ",Fun event for all,We first watched the shootout that the cast is a part of and that was fun for my 8.5&7 year old! Then went to go check in for dinner. The area you wait in is very cool setting! Dinner was good and I loved the performances during it! Plan to do a dinner like this when visiting NYC in a few months. My son loved the play the most. All of us thought everyone did well and a good story but my son was mesmerized the whole time. He loved shaking their hand afterwards and taking a pic with Huck!
46,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2019,not available,"Minneapolis, MN ",Best experience!,Came here with my family this summer in July for about a few days before going to Yellowstone. we saw the Huckleberry Finn play. It wasvery good and my kids enjoyed it and learned from it. Everyone there is so talented. One girl who sang a solo made all of the notes flow so well. Everyone was so kind and charismatic and made our night wonderful. Everyone from the actors greeting us at the end to the concessions people were funny with great personalities. There was a little girl who even played the violin at the beginning of the show and she was great. The guy who played the slave was beyond great and they all were! The actor who plays Huck has such stamina to. we didn’t know how he could keep going for so long during that show. At intermission the popcorn was a little salty but otherwise good and at the end the actors greeted us and we were able to shake their hands and say hello and that was cool for my kids to “meet the stars”. Broadway quality
47,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2019 , Family,"Wayzata, MN ",Big River,"Wonderful talent and excellent production values in a well-chosen Twain classic; a worthwhile stop during a road trip through WY. Vicki Garnick and family should be proud of the quality of art they have created in Jackson Hole. As a small theatre performer/playwright/director/producer from Minneapolis, I was thoroughly impressed.    My only suggestion would be to have Tech turn up the mics for some of the performers at quieter moments because it’s quite hard to hear them with the vent system running.    Bravo, JH Playhouse!"
48,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2019,not available, ,WHERE ARE THE LIGHTS,"My posts are mostly positive but I have a couple of issues I need to address. One is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed and CORRECTED by the owner and management, but first please, please make sure the air flow in the playhouse is adequate. I want to be comfortable when watching a performance (which I left early for it was too uncomfortable being warm). Now comes my big pet peeve, PUT LIGHTS IN THE WOMENS BATHROOM STALLS. I HAVE A DISABILITY AND IT WAS LIKE BEING IN AN CLOSET IN THE STALLS, I COULD NOT SEE PERIOD, other women were complaining as well and fix the locking mechanism as well on the stalls. But again get lights in those stalls. I can't believe that no one has ever complained. It made my experience at the playhouse a big negative and ended up leaving during intermission from the play to leave theatre to go back to my hotel to go to the bathroom. Did not return."
49,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2019,not available,"Tulsa, OK ",Fun Event in Town,"Great location, just off of Jackson Square. Dinner follows the 'town gunfight'.    Our party of 6 attended the dinner and the play. The play actors and actresses also served as restaurant waiters and waitresses. They sang several songs during dinner.    I would rate the food as 'OK'. Several choices, but portions were small. There appeared to be some cost control (i.e. very small family style salad for a party of 6). Also, they had run out of the dessert we selected.    Cute introduction of the entire cast between dinner and the play. Our seats were great (second row in the middle). We felt that the play was too long, especially the second half. Since we had to get there by 6 PM, 4 hours, ending around 10 PM, would have been plenty."
50,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2019 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Don't miss this show!!!,"My family and I saw the show last night and it was absolutely incredible! The theater is beautiful and on one of the oldest buildings in Jackson hole with the original Post office boxes and beautiful Western decor. The staff was friendly and fun and so talented. We attended the dinner show and had both a 10 year old and a teen and tow. It was the most fun thing we did on our trip!!! Don't miss it!!! The audience was captivated. We laughed, we cried, the show was so beautiful and funny and mesmerizing. I was sad when it ended. The audience have them a ovation. This is a must-see stop on your Jackson hole trip. We've been to other shows here as well and it's always a family favorite!!! The actors come from all over the country and WOW so talented. The music will take you breath away."
51,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Family,"Springville, UT ","I really wanted to love this, but came up short","As with most things these days I book reservations and read reviews online when making decision on events. For the Jackson Hole Playhouse I booked very early to insure my reservation and to get good seats. As a part of this process I was asked to include my dinner selection. I selected prime rib dinners for my party of seven and selected some of the best seats in the house. Upon arrival I was informed that their menu items had changed and to select something from the menu. We opted for steak since prime rib was not on the menu, but it turns out the steak on the menu is given in a very small portions of small slices of steak in a gravy. It was very apparent that corners were being cut on the menu offering to possibly save the playhouse some money. The play itself was okay, but the seating was very dated and very small. My good friend that is 6ft had to take an aisle seat in order to accommodate for no leg room in the general seating, plus the theater itself is in need of some renovations. I loved the decor in the lobby, but the seating was awful in the actual theater. About halfway through the play a group of six sitting behind us got up and never returned. After the intermission it felt like it was just my family and friends and a few couples left. At this point we were just committed to see if it would get any better. I really wanted to love this, but in the end I wouldn't recommend this event. Seemed a bit over priced for what you got."
52,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Teens Loved This Show!,"On our first night in Jackson, we went to the famous (fun and free) town square shoot-out, which is put on by the cast of the Jackson Hole Playhouse. My teen girls enjoyed the shoot-out so much that they wanted to go to the Huck Finn play that night. We talked to some of the cast members, who said that tickets were still available. We walked over and bought tickets for my two teen girls. My husband and I opted to sit it out and enjoy and evening alone at The Wort Hotel, which is situated diagonally across the street from the Playhouse. This was the best decision ever. My girls absolutely loved the play. So much so that they returned to the hotel just raving about it. My 14 year old asked if we could all go see it the next night! She liked it that much! I was floored. My girls have gone to various plays and shows with varying degrees of interest. I've never seen either one of them react the way they reacted to this show. They both absolutely loved it and continued talking about it for days (actually, they are still talking about it whenever we're discussing our family trip to Grand Teton, Yellowstone and Jackson Hole). Clearly this was a great and very memorable show. While I was glad for alone time with my husband, I was almost sorry that we'd opted not to go with the teens (not to mention I'm a big fan of Huck Finn).    Tickets were $40 and the show went for about 3 hours. A good value, in my opinion. The kids raved about this the same way they raved about seeing the Red Sox vs. Yankees at Fenway in Boston last year. Believe me, that little ball game cost a heck of a lot more than $40. Hats off to the Jackson Hole Playhouse - you impressed my Chicago area teens, who've done many a show/event in many places. Well done!"

We were a large group of 21 visiting Jackson for a family reunion. Our dinners came to our 2 tables warm and the meals were very tasty and even the vegans in our group were able to enjoy a warm dinner meal. The actors singing at dinner time were entertaining and we all thought the ""Big River"" cast was excellent as was the piano player. What a treat for our entire family who range in age from 80 to 11 years."

59,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Daytona Beach, FL ",Disappointing!,"Playhouse is in great old building worth visiting. Have dinner along with show or can do just show, which we opted to do. Did not look into what production was, but assumed it to be western in nature due to being in Jackson. Wrong! Was a Huck Finn production. Production itself was OK with good singing but did not expect this being in a Western town with visitors from out of the area wanting to get a feel for local flavor. Should have read more about Playhouse before purchasing tickets, which were expensive at $40 per person, with dinner would have been $75."
60,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Friends,"Montgomery, AL ",Dinner/Theater Review,"We were lucky enough to go on a weekday in June which got us into great seats in the front for the Huck Finn Show called ""Big River."" They play was great, with very talented actors. The cast did a wonderful job, as they also were our waiters and ushers!  The only problem I had was with the dinner. I was given a menu with choices and the ""king's cut steak"" was not available at all. And the saloon did not have any alcohol...whoever heard of that? I think they should have provided a small dessert with dinner (which was not included.)"
61,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Solo, ,Playhouse exceeded all expectations!,"I had the pleasure of attending the Playhouse's production of ""Big River"" and was completely blown away by the quality of the production. The acting, singing and dancing was energetic and top notch. The set design, music, costumes, sound, lighting--everything--was wonderful, so professional and entertaining. I've seen a lot of shows in various venues, including in Chicago and New York, and this ranked right up there with the best of them. The venue was small and intimate which just added to the fun.    Regarding ""Big River"" specifically, the Mark Twain tale does surface the issues of slavery and racism. But the overall story is about friendship, compassion, and loyalty despite differences--all important things to be reminded of. Well-suited for the whole family. Highly recommended!"

63,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Family, ,"Jackson Hole Playhouse in Jackson Hole, Wy.","We have just seen this year’s production of Big River at the Jackson Hole Playhouse in Jackson Hole, Wy. The acting, singing and dancing were wonderful. The total production was outstanding. We thoroughly enjoyed the show and recommend it hughly."
64,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Big River- Incredible Show!!!,"This show was one of the most incredible productions I have seen, and that is saying a lot considering that my family is from New York and have seen some Broadway shows. The actors are definitely Broadway worthy and the show sends a great message of equality. It shows how Mark twain was way before his time by showing how he believed in equality before it was truly accepted. While yes, the “n” word is used a few times, it is only used when necessary in order to show how truly awful conditions were and how much Huck Finn was able to look past society’s differences. As a family with kids of all ages who saw the show, we thought that the word was only used when necessary and that the show taught the kids about how even if somebody looks different, they are still very much alike and that they deserve the same respect. It also teaches kids of today to not let history repeat itself. The saying goes that “those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it” and this show teaches kids history in a more enjoyable way and the kids better retain the information and they will prevent history from repeating itself because everyone deserves equal respect.    Now, about the cast: they are INCREDIBLE and SO SO SO TALENTED. The dancing and choreography is very entertaining and very well executed. Their voices show incredible strength and passion for their craft. The acting is too great to explain. The actors flawlessly execute the funny, comedic moments while also perfecting the horribly tear-jerking, heart-wrenching scenes. The pianist is also beyond amazing and there are no words to describe that level of talent! Both the show itself and the actors make this a place worth visiting!! Everyone at the playhouse is so kind and welcoming to all. Though this may sound cheesy, let me be true and clear when I say that everyone there is like a big family and each guest at the playhouse is part of that family and it will leave you wanting to come back for more!! Even the food is delicious!! Enjoy! It’s worth coming in!!"
65,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Albuquerque, NM ",Down the River,"Not very impressed. The play was promoted as a family friendly and funny Mark Twain story about Huck Finn and the run a way slave Jim, I did not find it appropriate for children at all and certainly not funny unless you like making fun of handicap people (little people and ugly women). Multiple use of the ""N"" word turned my stomach even if the end result was that a slave was freed. There is simply no place in our society to glorify such work and certainly not any way to entertain children."
66,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Family,"Jackson Hole, WY ",Broadway in the Mountains,"Amazing talent, and staff, “Big River” is this year’s show. Quality menu to equal any fine restaurant in America. We are locals who attend several times a year. My son Connor with Downs Syndrome is a true part of the Playhouse family. They also offer a KIds Camp with professional talent training future theater stars. Golden Garnick is the star of the show and a graduate of Julliard. You haven’t experienced Jackson if you don’t see the show in their historic building. They also perform the Shoot Out downtown- the oldest live shooting show in America."
67,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Jackson, WY ",Road Trip - River Dinner & Dhow,This production was a story about Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer’s adventures.. The dinner is held in a saloon like setting and servers provide a little humorous singing entertainment during the course of the dinner in western saloon like costumes. and also act in the play. The food was good.  The theater is just right for the acoustics and any seat provides a great view. The acting and singing was as good as any I have seen on broadway. The scene changes were cleverly done.  I highly recommend this play while in Jackson Hole.

Upon arrival my husband became ill with altitude sickness so myself and my 2 sons ages 6 and 11 arrived to the dinner. At our arrival we were greeted by Golden who appeared to be the host for the evening. He was very kind and helped us with our coats and to find the appetizers. Shortly there after we were seated for dinner. Our server whose real name I can't recall, but my 6 year old recalls his name as Pierce in the play. He was very kind and gracious during dinner service. My children enjoyed dinner as did I. The food was very tasty and served with a smile. Once dinner service was complete the play began, and not only myself but my boys enjoyed the show. We enjoyed the music and the comedy. I was so incredibly pleased with my choice to book the dinner and to go through with it even after my husband became ill and I was solo with 2 young sons. If you are in Jackson and have a chance do give the show a chance you won't be sorry."

Or just enjoy the show in this old 1900's building with actors from around the US. In September, the play was Cat Ballou and everyone enjoyed the characters, the costumes and the storyline. It was a very enjoyable evening with good food, good selection of drinks and friendly staff (who also are the actors)."

The food was delicious and the entertainment during dinner added to the overall experience. We both had the steak entrée which included roasted potatoes and a roasted Brussel sprouts/green beans side. The steaks were cooked to perfection. We shared a slice of the raspberry/lemon cake for dessert and it too was delicious. The show was very entertaining and all of the actors committed a great deal of passion to their performance and their art.

74,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Naperville, IL ",Something Different ... Talented Cast,"We decided to check out the Cat Ballou musical at this playhouse. We didn't go to the dinner before the show and opted to dine elsewhere. The playhouse is a 300 seat auditorium and I don't think any seat would be a bad seat. You can get an alcoholic drink before the show at the bar in the lobby, but this is not open at intermission so be sure to get your cocktail before the show. There is a concessions stand open during the intermission selling popcorn, cake pops, candy and drinks. The woman who runs the show is super sweet and makes you feel welcome as she greets her guests entering the auditorium. There is a pre-show where the cast sings in the lobby which is cute, then the doors open and you are shown to your assigned seat. The cast is talented and the Cat Ballou show amusing providing laughs. After the show, the cast stands outside the auditorium and you have a chance to say hello. There were a lot of standouts but Cheyenne Rose, Cat Ballou and Farnsworth were my favs. This is a nice diversion from hanging at at bar in the evening. There are a few saddles bar stools at the lobby bar to sit in if you want that experience, too. Fun night if you want to do something a little different."

He showed us around the place and gave us a lot of the history how it had started by Vicki and her husband 39 years ago, sounded amazing and said the show each evening at present was Cat Ballou, we booked to have the dinner followed by the show. It was fabulous, me met Vicki who still does a tremendous amount and she was lovely. The cast who also wait on you and entertain you during the meal are great, wonderful evening out. May they continue to entertain for another 39 years."

The theater is old, as you can see from the photos, so the seats are not particularly comfy, but that just adds to the flavor on the old west vibe. The production was excellent. The actors did a great job. The pianist was flat out AMAZING!! We bought our tickets ahead of time and they were $40 each plus tax without dinner, so not inexpensive."

There is a pre show at 7:30 and then you go into the showroom for the show.....THE SHOW IS AWESOME!!!!!! Everyone you saw up front at the bar and restaurant are in the play which makes it even better. Everyone is so talented and the show is just as good as any show we've seen on Broadway!! We laughed A LOT. The acting, singing and dancing was fantastic! And everyone we met was so welcoming and friendly. The show has an intermission and during this time they offer snacks at an old fashion snack bar and took orders for milkshakes. Would go back in a heart beat!"

83,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2018 , Family,"Rock Springs, WY ",Exceeded all expectations!,"We saw ‘The Ballad of Cat Ballou.’ We thoroughly enjoyed it! The opening number in the lobby blew us away. The talent they have at this playhouse is really outstanding. The whole experience was really first rate.    My son was not eager to attend. He is 9 and he was not thrilled about sitting through a play. His aunt made a bet: if you hate it, I’ll pay you $5; if you like it you owe me $5. The pre-show in the lobby begins, the song is amazing and the MC is hilarious. My son leans over and whispers to me, “I think I’m going to have to get $5 from you so I can pay up!” It was his first experience with live theater and he could not stop grinning during the opening number.    I had the song “Outlaws” in my head for days after! The owner of the playhouse was there and she was friendly and welcoming to all the theater goers. The show was funny, the songs amazing and the interaction with the audience was wonderful. I have seen several Broadway shows and this was right up there! I think it only runs into early September...So go!    I would only have one complaint: the theater gets a little hot. We had front row seats and by intermission we needed a break. Luckily, you could get refreshments like a strawberry shake and stand outside to enjoy a gorgeous Jackson evening during the break!    In summary: loved it!"

The evening started with dinner served by the cast members. Our server was Cheyenne Rose who played a lead role in the play. She took the time to get to know a little about my wife and I, which was really nice for a change! She and the other cast members serenaded everyone in the dining room while we ate. The food was pretty good and the service was great! The play was hilarious and well done by the team. Several very talented vocalists and characters on the stage adding to the performance. We had a blast at the show! The piano player essentially plays an accompaniment during the entire show...he was fantastic!

We went to Jackson for rafting and camping but happened to walk by the playhouse. One of the staff very warmly invited us in and the next thing we were getting dinner and a show. The food was very good and the entertainment during the dinner was really fun.    As soon as we moved into the theatre my daughter instantly commented on the quality of the set and the costumes. Her praise continued throughout the show.    I would recommend this experience to anyone visiting the area. They clearly have an interest in putting on a quality show.    If there was any critique it would be to dress appropriately because the room can get a bit warm for the show. Layer up and shed a layer if you get warm.
88,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2018 , Family,"Florida Keys, FL ",What a fabulous little playhouse!,"Ok, admittedly, my family all loves theatre, so anytime we can try out a new place, we are going to! My husband and I have loved dinner theatres since high school. This one is done a little different as you eat first, outside the theatre and then go in to watch the show. The wait staff are the actors and every so often, they break out into song while serving! The food was great. The service fantastic! It was so much fun! And the show was extremely entertaining! It seemed at some point they may have gone off script and that made it even more fun! There was a lot of talent on that little stage. Great date night or family outing as well!

92,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Port Orange, FL ",Mediocre,"The food was edible, but not really very good. The sevice was good. The entertainment during dinner was fair. Some singers were okay others weak. The theater was awful. Rows were too clise together. It was very difficult to see. The acoustics were the worst. The piano player is the only person that I would say was really great. Some singers were okay, but most not so much. They put their hearts into the production, but it just wasn't successful. Being able to see and a decent audio system would have made the production much better. I would not recommend anything at this theater until improvements are made."
93,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2018 , Family,"Jackson, WY, ",See this play!,"The Ballad of Cat Balou is an original work composed right here in Jackson Hole and is cast by the most energetic, talented outgoing young group of actors imaginable. Right in your face the drama and comedy unfolds. These players and this material is noteworthy, capturing not only the old west roots of the region and catering to modern sensibilities in a wonderful historic setting. The management and crew of the playhouse have outdone themselves this year.  Please arrive before 7:30 to see the preshow.  I had a Huckleberry milkshake during intermission that was simply wonderful. A$7 Shake may sound high but it’s in support of a dwindling cultural treasure, the small scale almost melodrama musical comedy rife with dancing and sweet harmonies.  You have to see this show!"

The employees were so dressed up it looked like something out of a movie. The waitress was quick to seat us and get orders and within a few minutes they began to sing. It was amazing. What beautiful voices they had. Another worker from behind the bar sang to my daughter and two-stepped with her. It was lunch and a show and they made our family a part of the act!!!!

The cast was simply fabulous! They were so very talented and high energy. One of the guests in our party regularly attends theater from New York Broadway to Chicago to St Louis to San Francisco and she was blown away by the production. We enjoyed a fabulous meal and were blessed to have Rose as a server. She was busy and running like crazy but took the time to talk to us and answer our questions about her acting career. When we entered the theater area the seating is very humble and at first I thought, “what have we gotten into?” But truly the seats were not uncomfortable and the show was so good I immediately was lost to anything but the show! In many shows one actor outshines the rest and steals the show but truly every member of this cast was incredibly gifted - Rose, the piano player, Cordilla, Kid, Very Serious, and Clay were all our favorites. Every person in my family wanted to go back the next night and see it again (even my 15 yr old son who does not enjoy theater)! If you are traveling to Jackson this is a MUST-Do activity!"

113,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2018 , Couples, ,Tips are Demanded,"Dinner was very good. But when the bill came our waiter advised us that a 20% tip amounted to $9 per person but more would be greatly appreciated. REALLY?? We've been to dinner theaters often. The bill usually has the amount allocated to the dinner portion of the ticket price noted. Some then have the math worked out for 15, 18, 20 etc percent. Tips are the judgement call of the patron. If that's not the case then add it to the ticket price and say gratuity included. Maybe I'm old school but this really irratated me.    The play itself was very good. Energetic cast and a fantastic piano player. Good fun."

115,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Dec 2017,not available,"Charlotte, NC ",Would give 6 stars if I could,"This was for sure a highlight of our vacation. We adored this place. So festive and fun and the show was fantastic!! The actors / waiters were fun , friendly - honestly just perfect. We adored our main waitress Abby. She grew up in our home town and we bonded over that. They pulled our son in stage as part of the plat which he loved !! We will come back every time we visit !! This is a great activity for all ages"
116,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Dec 2017 , Friends,"Wilson, United States ",Surprised by how great it was,"Having lived in this area for 26 years, we had never gone to the JH Playhouse. My sister-in-law purchased tickets for 13 of us to go last night and we were all so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, the talent and just how fun it was. Highly recommend for a big group for an evening out. The food on offer is a great mix of meat, fish, vegetables, salad and the best rolls ever. The quality of the entertainment is exceptionally good."
117,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Dec 2017 , Solo,NJ ,Worth a stop....hope to return after renovations.,"Friendly and gracious staff/cast. The show was cute if a bit hokey. Talented cast. The food was absolutely excellent. Great location. Unfortunately the night I was there and probably for some period of time the rafter the main stage and figure area is being renovated or undergoing some form of construction. It is closed. Thus the show was held in the dining room area on very small stage.    I definitely enjoyed the dinner and the show experience. I would recommend this attraction. However, be advised that the approximate $80 price tag does not include even soft drinks, nor does it include dessert. With gratuity and no alcohol, figure about $115 per adult."
118,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Canton Center, CT ",Good performance. Dinner would have been fun.,"We enjoyed the show very much. Good acting and singing. We attend plays regularly back home and thought this was a good showing. Wish we'd signed up for dinner with the actors dressed in costume and having fun with the diners during the meal, but we weren't sure of our scheduled and didn't sign up.  One problem. We ordered the VIP seats in the first row, right in the middle. Great view, BUT the stage is rounded and in the middle it came so close to the seats that there was no room for my feet. Had to turn them sideways to fit. Fortunately, there were other seats available closer to the aisle, so we moved after a bit. I didn't see that the seats were uncomfortably close elsewhere, so probably not worth it to buy the VIP package."
119,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2017 , Couples, ,Thoroughly enjoyable😊,"Wonderful experience. Dinner, pre-performance entertainment, then The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Very well staged by a talented cast who also served as the wait staff for dinner."
120,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2017,not available,"Telluride, Colorado ",Enjoyed the Show,"Didn't go to dinner, but really enjoyed the performance of The Unsinkable Molly Brown. Great talent for a small town and very friendly staff.  Only issue was during the intermission there were still snacks and drinks for sale, but one of the cast members was behind the bar selling and she could not keep up with the demand and get back stage on time."
121,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",Terrific rendition of Unsinkable Molly Brown,Rainy weather got us to this quirky playhouse in Jackson. We had a most fun evening at the theater!  My favorite part was the slow motion avant-garde totally unexpected.  Buttercup rocked her role.
122,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Jackson, WY ",Don't Miss!,We had another fun evening at Jackson Hole Playhouse! My friends and I went for the whole package: dinner + The Unsinkable Molly Brown! The cast does everything! They are singing waiters and bartenders! The show during dinner is amazing! We all loved the play. The singing and dancing was amazing! We left with lots of warm feelings. What an enjoyable evening!!!
123,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Rockford, IL ",Best Dinner Theater we have ever seen,"Both the dinner and the performance far exceeded our expectations. The food was fantastic as was the dinner show with the signing and engaging of customers. The performance was absolutely amazing and deserves 10 stars. The theatre is old, but that adds to the charm. This is a MUST when you are in Jackson."
124,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Couples,Ohio ,Lots of fun!,"We didn't have dinner and attended only the show, but the people around us seemed happy with the meal. The show itself was fantastic with very earnest, heartfelt performances by all and very much in the spirit of an old-fashioned show. If you are expecting Broadway talent you might be a bit disappointed but not to say the voices and dancing were not excellent! Well worth the price!"
125,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Noblesville, IN ",Quaint Western Playhouse/Dinner Theatre,Dinner is optional. We simply went for the performance on what was an otherwise inclement day. Oldest building in Jackson. The Unsinkable Molly Brown musical made for an entertaining evening. Didn't see any children present.
126,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Wow - Far Exceed my Expectations,"Saw ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" this summer at the Jackson Playhouse this summer (2017). My wife and I were wow'ed by the Playhouse actors and crew. The actors not only act, but they are the ticket collectors, the snack bar hosts, the shootout cast, etc. The show lasted about 2 hours, acting was excellent, the sets, while basic, were clever. We did not do the dinner, but it didn't look like a bad choice. Spend the extra $15 and sit in the VIP seating for excellent leg room and view. It is obvious that this is their passion and the result is a show that you should make sure you see if you have a free evening in Jackson Hole for sure."
127,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2017 , Family,"Prague, Czech Republic ",Playhouse,"We saw The Unsinkable Molly Brown at this quaint playhouse. The actors were enjoyable to watch with lots of energy. They all did a great job. The singing was good with Mr. Brown being exceptional. The set was well done and the time piece clothing were very good. The slow motion scene was executed perfectly. The actors couldn't have done better. The seating is tight and the chairs are uncomfortable if you are a tall. After the play, the actors are in the lobby to shake your hand and greet you. An enjoyable evening."
128,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017,not available,"Overland Park, KS ",Dinner and Theater in An Historic Building,"We enjoyed a dinner and show at the Playhouse. The wait staff also perform in the show, so they sang during dinner. The food was fine. The theater was a little tight. But it was a fun and enjoyable evening."
129,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Family,"Aberdeen, UK ",Yeeehaw!!,Okay so at the end of the day it's not the cheapest night out... but...we opted for the dinner and show...I had the steak which was cooked perfectly.. the kids opted for the mac and cheese which was standard US fayre...and not very nice but the optional dessert made up for it though. During all this you a serenaded by the staff with some good ol' cowboy tunes...which was quite good and warmed you up for the main event.  After dinner you go through to the lovely theatre and what happens for the next 2 hrs plus blew me away (we saw The Unsinkable Molly Brown).. I was expecting some corny amateur music tourist production but no... how wrong was I?... The actors really give it their all and sang their hearts out..my youngest boy (13 yo) thought it was a bit long but everyone else thoroughly enjoyed it. We were all impressed by their enthusiasm and professionalism and all loved the slow motion part.The piano player deserves a special mention but this small group of actors are all very entertaining and I recommend to anyone visiting JH that this fantastic venue and enjoyable production is worth a visit.
130,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Fun filled evening,"If you need a little western fun in a very old theatre, go here and have a few drinks and enjoy the late evening cabaret. Arrived late on our first night in Jackson and fell upon a fun evening with the actors serving drinks, mingling with the crowd and just a great intro to the town. Later in the week most of the family went back and were thoroughly entertained by the theatre performance of The Unsinkable Molly Brown!  The dinner was excellent and the singing was wonderful."
131,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Couples, ,Fabulous performance,"The Unsinkable Molly Brown had a small but wonderful cast. Each of the supporting actors played a few roles and also took tickets and sold refreshments.    The lead, who is from Jackson according to the playbill, was extraordinary! She sang, danced, showed amazing physical strength and grace - and she can act! Savanna Garnick is good enough for Broadway.    The male lead also had a great voice. All the actors sang and danced quite well. The pianist was excellent and played so much music.    The scenery was first rate. This was all so much better than we expected from a tiny playhouse.    We will not miss the Jackson Hole Playhouse in any future trips.    One of the really fun things was the whole cast formed two receiving lines after the play so the whole audience could say hello individually."
132,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Marshfield, WI ",Dinner theatre,"Absolutely wonderful. A must see. The meal was really good and the singing and acting just amazing. From the moment we walked in until the end of the play, we were entertained."
133,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Couples,Switzerland ,Great evening show,"My husband and I are from Switzerland and are just back from the show. It was just great entertainment. Very professional singing and playing and the piano player accompanied the show so good. The szenery and the costumes, fantastic. We felt back in those days of the wild west at the beginning and enjoed every single minute of the show. Thank you so much for having entertained us so well."
134,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Family,"Washington, DC ","Hard-working staff, fun setting","We came to the Jackson Hole Playhouse as part of a tour, and had a special lunch arranged in the dining room. We first got a little history about the theater and got to take a look at the set of the Unsinkable Molly Brown, and then sat down for lunch. I hadn't realized what a fun show the servers would put on as we ate. They worked hard both serving the food and putting on a performance right in the dining room. It was a cozy and warm place, and I will try to go back and try the dinner/show next time we are in Jackson."
135,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Family,"Sandy, UT ",Fabulous Jackson Playhouse!,My girls and I go to the Playhouse every summer and love it! Every show is jam-packed with wonderful music and talented actors. We love the intermission shakes and treats and love how friendly all the Playhouse staff are. Going to the Playhouse is a highlight of every summer!
136,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Friends, ,Love love love it! So fun!,"So cute. So fun. Treated so well. Loved every second of it. Would I recommend going. Yes, yes, yes.  Went with 3 friends on August 9, 2017. Called ahead to make reservations. We were just attending the show not the dinner. Everyone in our party was paying separately when we arrived, so we were asked to arrive early so we would have to time to pay. We end up being late. We were treated so kindly. No one acted annoyed at us for being late. So grateful for how we were treated. Love the way to playhouse is decorated, it is so cute. The play was awesome. The Unsinkable Molly Brown was the play. The cast did a great job. The girl who played Molly did a excellent job portraying her. Over all great night. If you need a good laugh this is the place to come."
137,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2017 , Family,"Jackson, WY ",Fun Family JH Attraction,"Perfect opportunity for families to digitally UNPLUG and step into Jackson Hole history!! The JH Playhouse is a true Western entertainment experience. The owner operates at top notch and doesn't skimp. Everything about the Playhouse is authentic, vintage, and western. I like to describe my experience as charming, yet rowdy...truly exciting for every visitor. It is uncommon to find such wholesome operation. I took my children to see, ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown;"" ages three and eight. I will continue to visit the JH Playhouse. Make sure to get a huckleberry freeze.....DELICIOUS! So much fun for everyone!"
138,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Rock Springs, WY ",Fabulous entertainment and dinner!,"We had the dinner and show combo. The melodrama was ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" and the amazing part is that the actors do all the bartending and serving for the dinner. The dinner had about 4 different options and was very delicious with wonderful service by delightful friendly people. The crew was genuinely warm and welcoming and their acting and singing were utmost professional! What a great night!"
139,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Friends, ,Must see!,Incredible evening with delicious food and entertainment as good as you would find in NYC! What talent! For $75 you get a top notch meal at 6:30 with dinner music provided by the cast who also serve then the pre-show entertainment and at 8:00 the riveting musical. Unsinkable Molly Brown was high energy and very creative! Ample parking available across the street. Highly recommend!
140,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Family,Boise Idaho ,You have no idea the talent hiding in this place,"Bought VIP dinner and show tickets. Price of $90 was worth it. The dinner was pretty good. My mom had the chicken and capers/mash potatoes. I had the pork chops with cornbread huckleberry/apple stuffing. The dinner the OK. Not the best, not the worst. But the show, ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" was unexpected. The kids were from all over the country. They served us dinner, sang us song, then played their parts in the show. The voices, the intensity, the hilarity, the emotion; made me feel like I was on Broadway. Really, they were that good. I would go back year after year to watch a new show knowing they are this good.. Don't miss."
141,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017,not available,"Greensboro, NC ",You have to make this a stop on your trip,"My favorite stop in Jackson. This is fun for the entire family. My wife and I enjoyed a great dinner and show for my birthday on July 19. The dinner is presented to you at 6:30, and the show begins at 8:00. The old-west architecture and theme of the saloon and restaurant, along with the singing waiters and waitresses dressed in old-west costumes take you back to life long ago in the West. The specialty cocktails are amazing, and the entrees were exceptional. While some may choose to just see the play, I recommend dinner and a show. It is worth every penny. This was one birthday I will never forget. This is the only 5-star rating for a restaurant I gave to any location (I went to several during my week-long visit) in Jackson Hole. The play is also 5-star. You are getting Broadway-quality performances."

The historic charm of the building swept us away into another time in the west.(the oldest framed building in Jackson Hole!!)The staff, the show, the food all were amazing! Best part of our vacation!!!  A MUST VISIT ATTRACTION!!!"
143,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Rapid City, SD ",Go Go Go Go!!!!,"Steeped in history and lovingly kept up by a beautiful local family this playhouse has to be experienced. Food and drinks were delicious, and the play itself was amazing. This is not your run-of-the-mill tourist experience but rather a true destination for those interested in drama and one heck of a good time!  Thank you Vicki and family for an unforgettable evening!"
144,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Couples, ,"Needs repairs, updating, and needs better play","The Playhouse is very old and needs new seats and ventilation system. I have been to three plays there, this year the play just did not hit the mark, weak cast and the lines were not funny."
145,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Family,"North Salt Lake, UT ",Fun Show in Jackson,"This is my second time to the Jackson Hole Playhouse and we loved the musical, “The Unsinkable Molly Brown!” The performance was dynamic, entertaining with a high caliber of talent! We also enjoyed the dinner which was delicious! It included green salad, complimentary coke products, rolls, steak and potatoes. You can purchase other beverages and dessert for an additional price. We are very picky with our steak and it was cooked to perfection (medium well) with a juicy flavor. The actors in the show also are your servers and sing to you throughout your dinner. The dining area is very small so it is packed and very loud. They fill in their 6:30pm dinner first then 5pm if there is a need. The Town Square shoot out is also performed by the Playhouse actors at 6pm so they serve you in time to watch the show if you attend the 5pm dinner.    We loved our servers and the actors, however, my only note was they were such in a rush to get everyone in and out in time to serve the food and clear it out, that many times our servers kept asking if we were done to take our food away when were still eating. This happened several times throughout our meal, but we just laughed about it later. So that made us feel a little rushed as we were just trying to enjoy the food.    The theater is very small so any seat you have you can see the stage just fine. It is very hot in there so more air conditioning would be best, but it is an old building. They have a 15 minute intermission where they serve beverages, snacks, popcorn, etc. They only take credit card if the amount is over $15 for the snacks. Right before the show, they take milk shake orders of $7 each and cash only. We walked by the Playhouse during the day and the workers were very nice to show us around the playhouse and take photos for us. We stayed at the Four Winds Motel down the street from the playhouse which was so close that we even walked back to our motel during the intermission. The playhouse is a must do in Jackson!"
146,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017,not available,"Tampa, FL ",Fun family evening,The unsinkable molly Brown was a great play for the family one night of our wild west vacation. the actors were great and very enthusiastic. I had seen the movie years ago and it was great to see this play in such an historic building.
147,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Pelham, AL ",Too hot!,Even the actors complained about the heat. Why cram 300-400 people in a theater with minimal air circulation? It was delightfully cool outside and hotter than a six shooter inside. Morning after I have a cold from this experience Too bad as the performers presented a nicely prepared program.
148,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2017 , Family,"Severna Park, MD ",A must do while in the area,"This is a treasure in Jackson, and every year I think it cannot be any better. The shows and food have been wonderful, and we eagerly go back every year for the Shoot Out, early Dinner and Show. We have never been disappointed!"
149,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2017 , Couples, ,Wonderful time!,Our night started with an excellent dinner in the Saddlerock. I loved my veggie entree and the full-service bar is a great addition. The singing servers added to the fun atmosphere. The show was delightful. High quality talent in an intimate theater. I'd go again just to hear Johnny sing! The night we were there the cast held a post show cabaret. It was great to see their individual talents. And the Princess Prosecco cocktail I was sipping was yummy! It's not Jackson Hole without a visit to the Playhouse.
150,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Eagle River, WI ",Dinner and Show,"Great entertainment throughout dinner and play. ""The unsinkable Molly Brown"".  Trout and stuffed pork loin were very good! The actors and actresses were very talented. All 6 in our group were very happy we went."

The staff work hard to serve you and then take part in the show which is impressive. We watched the unsinkable molly brown. Bags of enthusiasm and quite a good performance from Molly. The rest of the cast were pretty weak but it was entertaining.
152,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2017 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",We got more than I expected,"I went in with low expectations, but they delivered a great meal and a load of fun. I highly recommend the stuffed pork chop for dinner. Wow, it was delicious! The waiters were all singers and actors. They were very talented and made the evening fun. We came back for the show afterwards and was not disappointed, however, we did have some young kids and could not stay for the second half."
153,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Granbury, TX ",National Parks,A great dinner with singing wait staff. My wife had the chicken and I had the Cajun trout. Both were great.

Savanna Garnick and Austin Ryan were absolutely perfect as the leads and the entire cast was great and full of energy. Dinner before the show was good, though the Brazilian Steak was not that great. But the entertainment was fun - during dinner the servers all sing solos as they interact with patrons (the servers are all part of the show's cast). A little expensive for dinner and a show, but the show was WELL worth it! So impressed. One suggestion is that the theater invest some money in new seats!! They were literally falling apart! So old and beat up and seating was tight."
155,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2017,not available,"Huntley, IL ",Excellent Show; Dinner OK,We ordered a VIP experience and had front row seats for the Unsinkable Molly Brown. It was an excellent show with talented players and singers. The meal was so-so and do call ahead for the current menu. We had our hearts set on the trout listed on their website but not highly spiced as prepared that night and settled on the stuffed pork chop which was tough and dry.

168,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2016,not available,"Toms River, NJ ",Good entertainment,This is an interesting building to visit. When you enter you think you are back in the mid 1800's because of the decor. There is a bar with saddles for seats. I saw the play Ballad of Cat Ballou performed. Even though it is performed by amateurs they do a commendable job. It is a fun show and a good way to spend 2 hours in Jackson.

My wife's pork was good. During dinner, the cast members served and sang. This was the highlight of the dinner.    The play was enjoyable. I enjoyed the cast members talent much more than the actual plot / storyline of the play.    I would go again, but without doing the dinner option."
170,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2016 , Couples,lords valley ,High Energy,"Lots of fun. Enjoy good food, while the in costume servers serenade you with some hilarious songs. Then move on to the theater to watch a high energy musical version of Cat Balou. A sort of Roy Rogers meets the Three Stooges production in which the  performers appear to be having as much fun as the audience. Not to be missed"

The food was great and the show was even better! The cast went out of their way to enhance show and engage the audience. The pianist was amazing! I would highly recommend this event!
172,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2016,not available,"Santa Fe, NM ",Fun evening - great performers - not so good musical.,"First of all, the experience was great. The performers gave their all and were very good musically and acting. They made you definitely feel welcome and a part of the show. The lead singers were particularly effective and good. However, the adaptation of Cat Ballou was poor. It was embarrassing to have a stereotype gay mexican character as one of the bad guys, it wasn't just over the top it was bad. Other changes they made to the movie script (partially to adapt to the necessities of the stage/musical) were also not very effective. In short, loved the cast and performers and there effort, loved the playhouse, but hated the production. For that reason I thought that it was way to expensive."
173,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",Lots of fun,"We booked a meal/show combo for our visit to Jackson. It was lot of fun. The food was good, especially considering sometimes the food at venues like this can be disappointing. I had the steak, my wife had the trout. We both enjoyed our meals. The show was very well done. The actors in the show are the servers, and they do a good job. Ours server played one of the lead roles and told us that one of the harder things for her to do was learn how to do that job. She said it was easy to switch into here stage role, but sometimes the details of serving and ringing up customers checks still tripped her up after a full season. A great evening that I would recommend to anyone who is in the area."
174,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2016 , Friends,New York ,A Very Special Playhouse,"If your in Jackson Hole, the playhouse is a must! The quality of the production of the Ballad of Cat Ballou was outstanding. Cast members are from all over the country and they are all very good. The dinner and dessert was excellent with cast members singing Western songs as they serve you dinner. A special treat comes after the production where the actors line up in the foyer and great the departing audience as they leave the theatre. It gives everyone a chance to talk to and take pictures with their favorite actor. You will not find any production in the country that gives you so much for so little."
175,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2016 , Couples,Minneapolis ,Jackson Hole Playhouse,"Food was good, service great, and the play (Cat Ballou) exceeded expectations, by a lot.

Plus we had VIP seating to ensure a good seat which was another $21 per person. At intermission we were given vouchers for popcorn, candy and pop. .  We saw Cat Ballou, The show was average and the cast was talented and friendly."
177,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Couples, ,Fantastic evening!,"We did both the dinner and the production of ""The Ballad of Cat Ballou"". The food was very good. I chose chicken and my husband had the pork loin. The waiters and waitresses are from the production cast. They were very friendly....great service.....and entertained us with singing periodically throughout our meal. The musical theater production was great! A high level of talent! Great production with great humor!"
178,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2016 , Family,"Victor, ID ",Very entertaining and fun,"Every September I try and attend the dinner and show. Dinner and singing staff is awesome. I ate the best salmon dinner in Jackson! My 10 year old grand daughter dressed up for a special night out and was so happy for the evening out - The waiter even sang to her! She sat through the show and said, ""I want to be in a play someday - everyone has so much fun"". The dinner and show is well worth the time and money!!"

180,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016,not available,"Knoxville, TN ",An Evening of Fun,"We were looking for something casual and enjoyable to do for an evening in Jackson. The Jackson Hole Playhouse fitted the bill perfectly! We watched a production of The Ballad of Cat Ballou. The singing and acting were excellent and the comedic timing was great! We smiled throughout the performance. The actors were extremely professional and performed with great enthusiasm, which must be difficult after performing nightly for weeks on end!    We opted for the theatre only option, since we weren't in the mood for a big meal, so I cannot comment on the food. However, I noticed that dinner was served in an authentic looking saloon and the waiters sang periodically. The atmosphere was terrific! The theatre is in the oldest standing building in Jackson, so it has plenty of history. The tickets without dinner were very reasonably priced and the available concessions were good, if perhaps a bit on the expensive side.    I would highly recommend this place for an evening out on the town!"
181,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2016 , Couples,"San Francisco, CA ",Fun Entertainment!,"There was so much energy and merriment on that stage that you couldn't help having fun! Lots of singing and dancing and Wild West shenanigans. I was impressed with their professionalism. It was a weeknight and not a big crowd, yet they played as though it were a packed house. Bravo!!!"

The venue is old but it works for the experience. Make sure you bring your own wine though because they do not serve drinks. We also chose not to eat there and just do the play
183,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016,not available,Phoenix ,A night well worht the money!,"Dinner, drinks, signing waiters who are the actors, great play satire on Cat Ballou. I figured it was going to be a bit hokey and was wrong. Talented acting, extremely energetic actors, and just a fun night for couples, families and kids"
184,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Baton Rouge, LA ",Broadway meets the Wild West,"Go to this playhouse for a truly unique experience. It's not broadway, but never claimed to be. Get VIP tickets for your group and enjoy the fun even more. Eat the dinner before the show. The food was pretty darn good.(We had the chicken and the fish.) You will probably visit Jackson Hole very seldom, so try this playhouse for some pleasant memories. Bring your cell phone to take photos and movies. Children will enjoy this attraction."
185,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Family,"Grapevine, Texas ",Steve from Texas,"Fantastic! Have been to the Playhouse a couple of times and thoroughly enjoy it. This year the play was Cat Ballou and it was hilarious! The actors are fantastic. It is family-friendly and I hope they keep it going for many years to come. It is one of the highlights of Jackson hole. By the way, you should have dinner at the play house before the play. The food is excellent. The actors serve the food and entertain everyone during dinner. We will be back."

187,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Oxnard, CA ",First class theater in the Wild West,"The playhouse is a cozy theater, offering a production during the tourist season (about May - September). The cast is very, very good and their rendition of ""The Ballad of Cat Ballou"" was far better than would be expected of local theater. We did not have dinner in the saloon but those who did seemed to be enjoying themselves."
188,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Montgomery, AL ",Western Chic meets Broadway,"Wow! This was a fun night! We had dinner in the saloon, served by players in ""The Ballad of Cat Ballou"". The food was surprisingly good - we had the trout and the servers broke out in song periodically. There was a preshow performance in the lobby before you were seated for the show, where you got a glimpse of the talent to come. The piano player was awesome. The playhouse is small and intimate and the set was authentic. The players were young, energetic and at the top of their game. Cheyene Rose was a standout, and Kid Shelleen had great comic timing. The play is witty, engaging and full of laughs. There is tap dancing, can can, and great singing, all accompanied by that aforementioned uber talented pianist. After days of hiking and biking, boatin' and floatin', this play was a true highlight of our trip! Don't miss it!"
189,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016,not available,"Yorba Linda, CA ","Wonderful performance, so so dinner","We stayed in town and attended a Thursday night performance of The Ballad of Cat Ballou. The performers, also your waiters etc. were amazingly good, especially the lady plying Cat Ballou and the piano player who made the show. The food however left much to be desired, it was average at best, serving lots of people quickly and I would not eat there again. They also made a great effort to sell drinks, desserts and even milk shakes during break. It seemed a bit desperate especially since this place could stand on its performance alone, well done all."
190,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Lamy, New Mexico ",Grant fun,"Had a great evening at the Jackson Hole Playhouse. Fun pre-dinner - food was good, service was excellent, and entertainment was great!!    Show was fun. Old building so seats are not that comfortable. Great entertainment."
191,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016,not available, ,Very fun evening suitable for all ages!,"We went to see Cat Ballou (didn't do the dinner there though) and it was amazing what they did with a very small stage and various sets. Even more amazing was the quality of the performers--a wonderful surprise in a small resort town. Music provided by a rag time piano player, which was great fun to watch. Milkshakes available during intermission which was a nice touch for the kids."
192,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Overland Park, KS ","Fun Show, Food OK","The show was very good and fun. The actors were energetic, talented and were having a good time! If you eat dinner before the show at the Playhouse, the food is just OK and the seating is very tight (at least where we were sitting). While you eat the waiters sing songs. We enjoyed the show (Cat Ballou) very much. Note that the sitting area for the show (different from the eating area) in tight also. There is basically no room for people to pass in front of others in the row, so in most cases if someone that is sitting in the middle, the rest of the people have to stand and move to the aisle so the people can get to their seats. Also it was noted that the far back seats have not been refurbished and were in bad condition (I don't know whether they put people in those seats or not as no one was seated in them). My recommendation is to go to the show as it was really fun, but eat somewhere else."
193,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Temple City, CA ","Such an enjoyable evening,",Had a delicious dinner before the show. Our waiter was actually one of the actors performing that night. Cat Ballou was very entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised by the talent.

Dinner was very nice, well organized and entertaining. The wait people then put on a great performance of The Ballad of Cat Ballou. Very professional, tailored to the audience, and quite enjoyable. One if the highlights of our trip to Jackson Hole!!"
198,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016,not available,"Venice, FL ",Fun show with great preshow entertainmant,We booked dinner with the show. Food is so-so and the seating area is quite cramped. My wife and I were seated with another couple and enjoyed their company. The highlight of dinner is the wandering singers who also serve the meal and are actors in the play. The play itself is very good and the cast is great. We would certainly attend the show when in Jackson but we may have dinner elsewhere.
199,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,"Carmichael, CA ","high quality, very enjoyable show","Brought my wife and kids to Yellowstone/Tetons for a week vacation. Stayed in Teton Village so decided to take in the show while we were there. Saw the Legend of Cat Ballou. The production was outstanding. My daughters (23 & 25 years old) were not too enthused about this but ended up loving it. The production is extremely high quality and the show very entertaining with great singing and a lot of madcap humor. I would definitely recommend this if you are visiting the area. We went for the dinner as well, which was OK, but I would dine elsewhere if I returned. The nice thing about the dinner is the entertainers who are in the show are your servers and break into song throughout the meal."
200,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Pleasant Grove, UT ",Loved it,"We did dinner and then the show. Dinner was actually really good. Delicious salad, entrees, and dessert. I had the trout almandine while my wife enjoyed the pork loin. They sing to you while they serve you. It's very good and entertaining and the place is pretty dang authentic. It claims to be the oldest standing building in Jackson.    We loved the play. The acting and sing are both very good. The play was a lot of fun and family friendly. They serve up some delicious treats at intermission. I thought the price for dinner and the show was about average. The show wasn't full. We went on a Thursday night and there were a decent amount of seats still available.    If you're going to eat dinner anyway, you may as well go here and enjoy a show too. I highly recommend it. Very professionally done."
201,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2016,not available,"Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States ",So much fun!,"Our waiter, Skyler, was the busiest man in show business! He took our orders, got our food, sang in ensemble numbers and did a couple of solos, and then checked us out. Then he was off to do a pre-show and then perform in the musical we saw after. All the wait staff performed during dinner, then put on a great show. They sang great, had wonderful comedic timing...way more fun than we cen expected!"
202,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Boise, ID ",The actors are EXCELLENT; dinner was ok.,"Very easy check-in for dinner. A big bowl of salad was already on the table and was fairly wilted. (We were there during a heat wave and the historic building never cooled off.) Our red wine also had suffered from the heat and was a bit ""off"". All four of us had the Flat Iron steak, which was very good. We tried several desserts and were disappointed. The cake was stale, the fried cheesecake was just odd, but the chocolate mousse was ok. We enjoyed the singing staff during dinner!    The show was fantastic with really great performances by everyone! The audience was engaged and we all had a lot of fun. There were quite a few children there and they loved the mad-capped antics. Before the show, you can pre-order a milkshake to enjoy during intermission. That is key for any warm night, since there is no ventilation in the building. Overall, it was a night of good fun and we were glad that we did this!"
203,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Snohomish, WA ",GREAT Evening Fun,"This is a must do when in Jackson Hole. Tthe food was both prepared and presented well, but do not skip lunch - the serving sizes are small. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in cowboy & saloon style and they take turns singing cowboy ballads during dinner. After dinner, there is a brief interlude while waiting for the play to begin.  The play is a fun take on the story of Cat Ballou and the wait staff is also the actors and actresses. It was very entertaining and the piano player was absolutely excellent. The show is appropriate for families."
204,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,"Laguna Beach, CA ",Family friendly,"Great time with our group of 9.  Fantastic actors, who will entertain durning dinner. We enjoyed the steak but the trout also looked very good. Beware they like to pull from the front row of the audience."

This is our second visit as we had been here 18 years ago and we enjoyed this one just as much as then.  We highly recommend this to anyone visiting Jackson Hole ."
206,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Kirbyville, MO ",Always impressed with this little theater,"Every time we visit this area, we always attend the musical that is playing. This year it was the Ballad of Cat Ballou. It was funny, entertaining, engaged the audience, and well done. We had a great time. One FYI, the theater doesn't have air conditioning, so the night we went was quite warm. I recommend going outside during the intermission to cool off. Another recommendation is to get to the theater early. They do a pre-show inside the lobby area, and if you don't get there early, you'll miss it, because there isn't enough room inside to fit everyone."
207,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016,not available,"Raleigh, NC ",Fantastic !!,"First of all, Vickie was very helpful in ordering tickets for ""The Ballad of Cat Ballou"" months ahead of our visit. The evening of the show, all of Jackson, and Wyoming, had lost power. A nice young man at the door informed us, they were working on getting generators, but ""the show would definitely go on !"" Despite the lack of light, and air conditioning, the staff and cast were in great spirits, even excited for the challenge. Power returned 5 minutes before curtain time, and the show was great. Very talented performers. I'm sure it would have been great with or without power. Theater atmosphere was very old western authentic. Fun evening !"
208,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Couples, ,The Ballad of Cat Ballou,"We went to see this musical comedy several nights ago during our short visit to Jackson Hole and I would advise anyone to do likewise. The show was charming, bawdy, western humor with tongue firmly planted in cheek. The players are fantastic and had us belly laughing throughout. The playhouse itself is something to be seen. If I were to mention one drawback it is that the theater was crowded and in an old building with hot stage light and not much ventilation it got kind of hot during the play but at intermission we simply walked outside the bar and cooled off. Don't miss this if you are in Jackson!"
209,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016,not available,"Williamsburg, VA ",Very professional production & a fun evening.,"We stopped at the Playhouse earlier in the day to get tickets for an evening production of The Ballad of Cat Ballou. The subject certainly fit the location. We met two of the actors, they waited on us in the bar. My husband loves chocolate malts & that's one of their specialties, it didn't disappoint.  When we returned later for the production it was nice to already ""know"" a couple of the performers. Most of them had auditioned in NYC. The constuming, make-up, choreography, acting, singing, dancing, etc was very professional. All the actors seemed to also be having a great time as well as the audience. Would highly recommend."
210,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,"Jackson, WY ",Fun night in Jackson,"A fun evening in Jackson and will try to continue the tradition every year. we took our grand children(,5 &8 )and they were thoroughly entertained. Really loved the Milkshakes at intermission! Good entertainment for the children getting them used to acting and singing. The venue is small so the stage is pretty up close making it easy to see. Definitely worth a visit when in Jackson Hole"
211,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Lake Charles, LA ",First-class entertainment,"Saw The Ballad of Cat Ballou there and loved it! The talent is world-class (and I've been to Broadway, Off-Broadway, etc.), and you witness it in an intimate, fun setting. If you love or even like theater, you must go."
212,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016,not available,"Houston, TX ",ALWAYS A MUST!,"This is one of our favorite things to do when we're in Jackson Hole. Our sons, now adults, have great memories coming to their plays. The actors are amazing! This seems to always get better and better every time we come. Wish we had something like this in Houston! Warning: If you sit on the front row, you might end up on stage. Great fun!"
213,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,"Jackson, MS ",Dinner and a Show for 4,We really enjoyed our experience. The food was much better then I anticipated and the performers were really good. I was concerned that it would be amateurish but the whole thing was professional and very well done. We saw the Ballad of Cat Ballou. The Playhouse itself is something to see.
214,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,"Taunton, UK ",Superb night out,"We originally called in looking for a restaurant for a family of 5 (2 parents, 3 sons aged 17, 14 & 11) and ended up with so much more.    Dinner is served in an old-style saloon, complete with swing doors and western memorabilia. The food is pretty good (deep fried cheesecake for desert unforgettably awesome!), but to be honest it turns out that isn't the main reason why you go.    The food is served by staff dressed as cowboys and showgirls, who periodically burst into country and western singing. The atmosphere is superb. After dinner, you're taken to the theatre in the back, where the same staff turn into actors and musicians. We were then entertained with a wonderful production of Cat Ballou. Music and singing was great, and all the audience seemed to have a great time. Even our teenage sons were on the edge of their seats, laughing and singing along.    If you're in Jackson Hole, do not miss this. Superb!"
215,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Marshall, MI ",A Musical Journey Back to the Old West-Fun for All!,"This zany western comedy will have the whole family laughing! This little gem of a theater and its cast of talented professional actors make Cat Ballou a ""must see"" if your in Jackson Hole! We loved the beautiful costumes, authentic ragtime piano, great song and dance! Don't miss the entertaining shootout in town square or the yummy dinner and fun PreShow! The beautiful singing saloon girls and waiters were a special treat! As good as any Broadway Musical in New York but set in the quaint and beautiful little town of Jackson Hole! Make sure to taste the Huckleberry Malt or Sarsaparilla float for an Old-Fashioned treat!"
216,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,Tempe ,Family - ages 10 to 77 all had an amazing time!,"We just finished a week in Jackson Hole with the playhouse being our last hurrah.    We did the dinner before hand and most everyone enjoyed their meal. Two of our group had the pork loin which they felt were overcooked, but they never complained (even when I pushed them to do so) so the playhouse never had a chance to make it right. A lot of us had the steak which was really, really delicious and the kids all had chicken fingers which they really liked. We all ordered dessert mistakenly thinking it was included - not the fault of the playhouse but do keep in mind that it's not included. Plus - if we had skipped dessert then we would have been able to enjoy the milk shakes at intermission. Plan to do that for yourself!    There's a lot of singing at dinner. Some of it seemed over the top, but you won't think so after you see these talented people on stage! And you won't believe these amazing actors graciously served your dinner! :-)    The quality of the acting and singing was superb. We were all blown away! And wow - the piano player!!!! He was so talented! I play a bit and was so impressed!    I did feel that the family friendliness was a bit borderline....the 10 year olds - I think the adult humor went over their heads and of course they really loved all the slapstick. My 12 year old son though was blushing at intermission and after it was all done too. You'll need to be the judge for yourself if it will be a good fit for your family.    Also know that it runs pretty long when you have dinner too. We had dinner at 6:30 and weren't done until 10:30. Other places like this serve dinner concurrently with the show. At the Jackson Hole Playhouse you have dinner first and then are moved into the theater. Just make sure you don't have to wake up early the next day for a flight or a trip to Yellowstone!    All in all everyone really enjoyed this experience and I would definitely recommend it to others! Thanks Jackson Hole Playhouse for a memorable last night in Jackson!!!"
217,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016,not available,Alabama ,Great food and show!,"This was our second trip to JHP in two years. The diner was great, but the best part was the singing during the meal. The actual performance was very entertaining, but I wouldn't describe it as ""family friendly"". There were several instances of adult themes and language. With that said, the performers were very talented and the show was professionally presented."
218,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,"Cottage Grove, WI ",Loved it!!!,"This musical is one funny line after another, one great song after another, one fabulous dance number after another. If you're looking for a wonderful, entertaining evening this production is for you. We all truly enjoyed it from start to finish. It seems the performers are having as much fun as we were. Cat Ballou is highly recommended if you're anywhere near Jackson Hole, Wyoming."
219,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family, ,"Awesome, awesome, awesome","This place is a must see and do in Jackson.    I just happened to run across the place last August and they were kind enough fit me in. The show was Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. Great show.    The food and entertainment are absolutely worth the investment.    The characters in the play are the same that serve you. There is no denying they work hard.    The food is good. Many times at venues like this, the food is barely edible, but both times I've been here it is really good.    The play this year, Cat Balou, was a great production. The talent in the cast of characters is obvious.    My favorite character is Very Strange.... Hilarious.....He had me in stitches.    We will be returning again."
220,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates ",An amazing evening!!,"Booked the dinner and play experience and had an amazing time. ALL the cast were exceptional, truly talented. Acting, singing, comedy, tap dancing and acrobatics. Never a dull minute from start to finish. The cast also gave a performance during the meal, which was delicious, my wife and I both had the steak , the couple sharing our table had trout and chicken and all were impressed. After the show the cast all line up to thank you the audience but most importantly gave us the opportunity to thank them for a great nights entertainment. A MUST do when in Jackson Hole."
221,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Couples,ames ia ,Fun evening,"We have attended at least 3 shows at the Playhouse over the years and have always enjoyed them. Cat Ballou was the best of the bunch-- this is a talented cast and a lively adaptation of the original.    Next time we come, we will do the dinner first as this looks like fun, especially since it's tough to get in and out of a restaurant on the square between the shootout and the show."
222,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Couples, ,So much fun! Worth every penny!,"We probably would never have checked this out if not for the advice of a friend. What a pleasant surprise! Thoroughly entertaining, with lots of laughs. They have this down to a science. Dinner started the fun with the staff dressed in costume and breaking out in song while serving us our food and drinks. Then a brief pre-show performance in the lobby with fun catchy music and song.  Then in to the theater for the play. Catballou truly was zany. I was impressed with the level of talent of the cast. We were truly entertained the whole evening. We consider this a must see if you are in Jackson!"
223,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Excellent but too racy for children,"Amazing actors, true talent. We were told this was ""family fun"" but the show is much too explicit for children."
224,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Friends, ,"Rude, bad service and terrible attitude","We were looking forward to dinner and a show. We had reservations for a party of 17. They seated 15 and said there was no more room. We asked about simply sliding 2 additional chairs into the (3) tables we had. The answer was no, we don't do that. My wife and I were told we could sit at the bar, but gosh, they would compensate us with a FREE DESSERT! The food lacked quality, the servers lacked more. When I spoke with the manager and asked why he took a reservation for 17 when he only accommodated 15m he said it was the travel agency's fault -- a LIE, as we made a private reservation, not through the agency. He also said we got a discount -- A LIE, we did not. Finally, the fool of a manager told me (direct quote) that ""I chose to have a negative experience"" (Who talks that way?) and when I asked if that was his business answer and told me (and again, I quote) ""This conversation is finished"" Needless to say, We didn't bother staying for the show we had paid for, no compensation or slightest apology was offered. Beware and stay clear of this place."
225,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016,not available,Boise ,Great play with enthusiastic actors,Saw the Legend of Josie Wales; very good play and entertaining. Actors were enjoyable and friendly. Love the old playhouse with its history. good for all ages
226,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Key West, Florida ",we had such a great time.,"When I booked 3 months ago, I did not know what to expect. I had read some reviews about the food which was average but nevertheless, I decided to book for the 6:30 dinner and the show. The dinner was above our expectations. My husband had a steak very tender and I chose the trout. They were both delicious. We were entertained while we were dining by the waiters and waitresses who are also playing in the show. The show was great, the actors are absolutely outstanding and very professional. The cast is supported by a first class pianist who is amazing. We enjoyed this show from beginning to the very last minute We were seated at the 3rd row which is great if you do not want to be pulled onto the stage to be part of the action. But they do it so nicely that it isn't a problem even if this kind of situation makes you feel uncomfortable..."
227,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Family,"Waukesha, WI ",A must do in JH!,"Food was surprisingly good - dinner entertainment was fun and the play (Cat Ballou) was awesome - very funny! We took our skeptical 21, 20 & 17 year olds and they had a blast and thought it was the best meal of the trip - and we didn't have a bad meal. You really must do the intermission milk shakes, too! Don't go the Jackson Hole without a trip to the Playhouse (unless you have crying aged kids, that it). Don't be afraid to take those skeptical aged kids - they will love it!"
228,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Couples,"St. George, UT ",Great entertainment & food,We changed our plans last minute and instead of going to the Bar J Wranglers we went to dinner and a play at the Playhouse.

Not knowing what to expect, usually most dinner/theater places I've been to in the past, the meal is so so. Not the case here. The meal has a menu to choose from. We had a mixture of entrees, and all were prepared perfectly. Our server was excellent! Very enthusiastic, loved her job, just a delight. We thought can it get any better than this. Well yes it does! The performance was simply put, outstanding!!! The group is so talented and gracious, unbelievable performance. It's a must if traveling to Jackson Hole!"
230,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Friends,"Providence, RI ",Absolutely fabulous!,"Went for dinner and show (Ballad of Cat Ballou). We had SO MUCH FUN! The entire staff/actors were so talented and funny. We LOVED the show. Haven't seen a play that good in a long time. It takes a lot of talent for someone to sing, dance, act, and do comedy and this cast did it all flawlessly. Would definitely recommend, family friendly (although some pretend shooting and innuendos). Not for little kids but definitely pre-teens and teens would be okay with it. Just go, you won't be disappointed."
231,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family,"Hollywood, FL ",A Great Experience,"I enjoyed the show with my family of five (13,11,11). Let me start by saying we frequent Broadway often and was a bit nervous as to what I was going to see. I wanted to take my family here as I had seen a show at the Playhouse when I was in High School and remembered having a good time. The show and the cast far exceeded my expectations. The show was funny, the songs were catchy and the overall experience was awesome. I can't stress enough how all of us thoroughly enjoyed the show! I highly recommend it. If you can ascertain the front row, it does have some funny extras."
232,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2016 , Friends,"High Point, NC ",Fun Show,Visited the show last night. Lots of fun & reasonable rate. Didn't do the dinner. Great way to end our vacation. Small & intimate theater. Call for reservations & pick tickets up before the show.
233,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family,"Houston, TX ",Cat Ballou - Quite Enjoyable,My family of 4 attended the Jackson Hole Playhouse Cat Ballou performance (children 10 and 13). We had a wonderful experience. Dinner was very good although tables were set very close together. It was great seeing your server perform. The cast is extremely talented. Story was funny and entertaining. We would definently do it again!!
234,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family,"Des Moines, IA ",Great fun,Full blown effort by great people. Western themed show with a world class piano player. Original atmosphere. Dinner before show is a available. We regret not knowing about it before hand.
235,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family,"Springfield, MO ",Fun time but dinner just average,"Went to the dinner show and play last night. Dinner had salad, choice of flat iron steak, pork loin, trout, or chicken. Our group did the steak and pork loin which were just average. Seating was very tight but waiters and waitresses (who are members of the cast) were entertaining. Dessert is extra. The play was Cat Ballou and it was wonderful. Despite cramped seating in the theater the play made us laugh and we all walked out with a smile on our face. Would definitely go back for the show again but not for dinner"
236,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Tavistock, UK ",A really fabulous show,"We saw The Ballard of Cat Ballou at the Jackson Hole playhouse last night. It was absolutely great! Energetic, funny, visually attractive. I cannot praise highly enough the performance and the talent that the actors and the pianist displayed. I still have the songs and images in my head and my face ached with smiling from beginning to end of the performance, A wonderful memory of our last night in Jackson before sending our way home to England and the aftermath of the Brexit"
237,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family,"San Diego, CA ",Highlight of Trip!,"We had 12 people in our party, 3 grandparents and 5 kids from ages 6-10. Dinner was great for everyone and was fun. They will allow you to bring in your alcohol with a cork fee.    The show was amazing, very talented pianist and actors that created a show that was great for the whole family. Lots of funny one-liners and got us in the western spirit of the town. I highly recommend that this will create memories. My brother and I made sure we went to the play, as this was the memorable thing we had nostalgia from when we came while in middle school 30 years ago."
238,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Meridian, ID ",Dont miss out !!,"If you are going to Jackson Hole WY, DO NOT MISS catching the show at the Jackson Hole Playhouse. We just saw The Ballad of Cat Ballou and it was one of the very best they have done and we have been going there each year for the past ten years. Many, improvements over the years but this years production is exceptional. Casting is wonderful."
239,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family,"Baton Rouge, LA ",VIP Seating well worth it,"We visited with our 3 children (12,10,7) on a Thursday evening. We had dinner at 6:30 followed by a wonderful show. The food was average but the service, atmosphere and show were excellent. We paid a little extra for first row seating which was so close to the stage it made you feel like you were in the show. They pulled 3 adults from the front row to be involved in the show. It is BYOB so brig a bottle of wine for dinner!"
240,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family,Sand Springs ,Wonderful Dinner and Show!,"I made these reservations for our trip to Jackson. It was my daughter's 12th birthday and I wanted to do something to surprise her and this did NOT disappoint! Our waitress, Kelly was amazing. So sweet and very very nice to my daughter, the birthday girl. Dinner was great, we all had the flat iron steak. My daughters tried the Apple Beer, which was shockingly good as well as the Huckleberry soda, which was a bit sweet for me, but they enjoyed it. The birthday girl really enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake. The show, The Ballad of Cat Ballou, was AMAZING! The singing, dancing, acting and piano playing was top notch. We had never been to the Playhouse and did not know what to expect, but we are so glad we went! Even my daughters told me that they want to go back and see more of the shows there! We have seen many shows in many different settings and this really compares to some of the Broadway shows we have seen! It was truly amazing!"

242,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Couples,Bowral ,What a great night of live theatre in Jackson WY,"I was delighted in the fabulous show put on by The Jackson Hole Playhouse. We were first time international visitors to Jackson and were first of all charmed by the wonderfully friendly people at the box office. So different to trying to buy over priced tickets for over rated Broadway shows! Here was this superb company of very talented players, keeping alive a vintage theatre, full of atmosphere, and a fantstic show, a musical version of Cat Ballou. It was one of the best nights I have ever experienced in any theatre. Congratulations to the whole company. Highly recommended."
243,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016,not available, ,Enjoyed the performance of Cat Ballou,"My wife and I enjoyed the performance of Cat Ballou. The cast was funny (corny, but that is intentional and part of its charm). The setting is intimate. I don't know that I would necessarily bring the young kids as it is kind of a PG-13 with implicit references to the showgirls also being prostitutes, but it is fun. Spoiler alert: this version of 'Cat Ballou' is different from the 1965 movie, so don't expect it to track that version of the story. But it was fun."
244,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family,"Springville, UT ",Dinner and show,"We had dinner and watched the ballad of cat ballou. The dinner was great, the staff is amazing, everyone is so friendly from taking a reservation for me over the phone ( I live in another state) to serving the dinner, all while being entertained at dinner. The show after dinner was so much fun, my family loved it! It was so funny and their interaction with the audience was great! They are amazing and worth the trip!"
245,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016,not available,"Centennial, CO ",Just peeked in,"We already had a chuckwagon dinner booked for that night so we were not able to see the show but had a sarsparilla and huckleberry soda at the bar as we chatted with the actors/staff. They turned on the lights in the theatre so we can get a look around. Great little playhouse with fun lobby and bar area. Staff and actors were all fantastic, very friendly. I am looking forward to actually seeing the show next time."
246,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Ankeny, Iowa, United States ",Great Entertainment!,"We had the dinner/show evening & it was terrific! We have been to several other similar venues in other places, but without a doubt this was the best! We saw The Legend of Cat Ballou and it was so funny & so well done by the actors, it was great! They even interacted with the audience during the performance. The piano player was excellent, he is so talented!! The actors also serve the meal and do it very well too, and actually sing individually while you are eating. I highly recommend you spend an enjoyable evening at the theater when you are in Jackson Hole!"
247,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Solo,"Cranbourne, Australia ",Dinner and show,"Best meal, actors friendly, they interact, top show, one of the highlights as its unexpected different and you laugh all through the show."
248,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Friends, ,Great nights entertainment,"An amazing evenings entertainment. The night started with an excellent meal, can't beat a well cooked flat iron steak, served by the performer who then entertain us with a well written, well choreographed performance of the Ballard of Cat Ballou. The energy throughout the evening was infectious with the audience enjoying every minute of the performance. Even at the end as we left the cast was there to shake our hands as we left. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Jackson."
249,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Paducah, KY ",Review,Great place to relax for the evening and see a great show and enjoy a good meal before. The food was delicious and the actors put on a great show of Cat Ballou
250,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016,not available,"madison, al ",FUN FUN FUN,"Impressive cast! We went there to see Cat Ballou and was extremely impressed with the actors/singers and the play. Very well performed. Each person displays talent beyond what you would expect to find in a small town. They are all really good. Lots of laughter too. It was a large cast, at least 15, for a small town. This is a jewel you shouldn't miss.  It is a dinner theater. I thought the food was okay but worth going for especially because some of the performers break out in a few songs as they walk among the dinner guest. Not too many tables. This area is amazingly well decorated. Even if you don't go for dinner or the show you should stop in just to see this place.  Before dinner the cast does a skit in the center of town to get everyone ready for a good time."
251,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Friends,"Phoenixville, PA ",A evening to remember!,"What a wonderful evening we had! We saw The Ballad of Cat Ballou--very funny, very entertaining, exceptional acting and singing. The theater is small and cozy so you get a fantastic view and feel the exuberance of the cast. The piano player is amazing-very much a part of each scene. The actors also were the servers at dinner and they broke into song throughout our meal. Their talent is wondrous. The young man who sang 'Unchained Melody"" is remarkable. Our meal was tasty as well. We had the portobello mushroom dish and the trout. Both were well presented and tasty. The chocolate mousse for dessert was great. Our evening was memorable and I highly recommend visiting this historical Playhouse and Saddle Rock Saloon--not only for the environment but mostly to enjoy the talent of these actors and actresses. What a 10 star evening!!"
252,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2016 , Family, ,Dinner and theater,What a pleasant surprise for our kids and ourselves. Dinner food and service were 4 out of 5. Service was excellent. The talent of the staff during the theater portion of the evening was great. We watch Cat Ballou. Highly recommend for anyone.
253,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,May 2016 , Couples,"Sunnyvale, CA ",Dinner and Play were Fantastic!,"We had a wonderful time at the opening of the 2016 summer season at the Playhouse and Saddle Rock Saloon. The play is The Ballard of Cat Ballou, which is not the same as the movie as the actors and play company wrote their own version...and it is very funny.    The dinner was in the saloon. We were a couple and were seated with another couple as the saloon is very small so any party less than 4 may need to be seated with someone else. Some of the actors are your waiters and busboys. During dinner many of them break into a song or two. Food was ok, not great, but ok. We both had steak which was tasty and tender. The price for the meal includes soda, salad, bread, entree, potatoes and a veggie. Dessert is extra. We did get a chocolate mousse which was great, for $6. If you are looking for fine dining before a play, this isn't it, but it does provide you with a great experience and setting to get you into the mood of theater performance.    As I said, the play was written by the cast and is very funny. The theater is small, so as we were in row 3, middle of the row, it felt like we were part of the performance, at times.    All in all, I would say this was one of the highlights of our trip to Jackson. If you want a fun evening, I highly recommend.    If you go, Joel is a good waiter / actor and is very personable making the dining experience more enjoyable."
254,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015,not available,"San Diego, CA ",An historical theater...first building in Jackson Hole! The plays are amazing!,"My family has been going to the Jackson Hole Playhouse for years. It is always a special treat to see what play they are performing every summer. My kids' favorite is Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The adjoining restaurant is fantastic so the dinner/theater combo is the way to go. The Garnick family have been the nuts and bolts of this theater for years. They are very special people. It's a block off the main square, so look for it. The entire family will love it!"
255,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Friends,Oregon ,Highlight of the trip,Traveling to a family reunion and started our trip with dinner and a show at the playhouse. It was an incredible splurge experience. The food was good but what I remember more was the dinner entertainment before the actual show. The performers sang and interacted with us as we dined. Crowded eating area but I think you are supposed to feel you are in the middle of everything. The theater was slowly being upgraded and thankfully we were in the middle near the front where the seats had already been switched to newer ones. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was our show and I am a complete fan of the movie. This had its own unique differences but was still enjoyable (minus the insults to Mormons). Meeting the performers as we exited was also enjoyable and we met some from our home state. The cost would prohibit me from doing this regularly but absolutely worth the memories.
256,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jan 2016 , Business,"Jackson, Wyoming ",Great place for a Private Event,"We held our annual employee party at the JH Playhouse, Speakeasy, 1920's theme. What a great venue. Vicki was very accommodating with set up of the venue. The food the Playhouse provided was fantastic. The bartenders were on top of things and keep the drinks flowing. Well worth the price we paid. Great, great place for a private event. We will definitely hold another party there. What a wonderful historic building. Perfect for our themed night."
257,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015 , Family,"Austin, TX ","Actually, surprisingly really fun.","My parents insisted we go with them to dinner and a show. I thought it was going to be mega lame, but it was actually all really fun. I highly recommend the dinner and show. You won't be disappointed."
258,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015,not available,"Narellan, Australia ",A Good Night,We got tot to go this on a tour we were on as there were only 20 of us on the tour. We were supposed to be eating at our hotel but were treated to dinner and the show Seven Brides for Seven Brothers at the Jackson Hole Playhouse. The cast were waiters/waitresses at dinner. Dinner was OK but they seemed a bit overwhelmed as they were full up for dinner-we did all got enough to eat. Tables were cleared and moved and everyone was seated in the restaurant area. The cast introduced themselves and talked to us. We then got seated in the theatre and the show was fantastic! When it finished the cast were lined up both sides to say good bye to us which was lovely. As if that was not enough each night (can't remember if it was 6 or 6.30pm) they perform a free shootout show in the main square weather permitting. I have never seen such a dedicated staff.
259,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2015,not available,"Knoxville, TN ",Got to see this!,"This is a beautiful place and if you don't see a play, still visit. It is full of wonderful things. We didn't have time for the play which we were both sorry."
260,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Rehovot, Israel ",Not Broadway quality,We saw Steel Magnolias in September 2015. The theater was maybe 1/3 full. The acting quality was one step up from a high school play but good enough not to leave a dry eye in the audience.
261,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Peachtree City, GA ",Fun little play,"We bought tickets to see Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. This was a very fun night. The costumes were colorful, the actors were friendly and the show was fun! The popcorn in the lobby was some of the best we have had. Not sure what makes it different but it was very good. Lots of unexpected laughs during the show. I would recommend it. Family friendly."
262,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Philadelphia, PA ",Broadway calibar! And I've been to Broadway MANY times!,"When I first told my extended family of 17, all regular visitors to Broadway, that on one of our precious nights in Jackson Hole, we were going to a corny cowboy dinner theater about 20 minutes away from our luxury Four Season Hotel, you can imagine the groans I received from the group (largely represented by 13 to 21 year-olds). I was even nervous about my decision, but,alas, this place not only didn't disappoint us, but totally exceeded all of our expectations! We are recommending it to everyone we know who is visiting the area, and so are our kids! What a fabulous show. It was appropriately interactive and totally professional, with talents right off of Broadway, Julliard trained actors, fantastic accompaniment and sharp wit! I would recommend this as a MUST SEE attraction for all ages (okay maybe older that 7 years old, just for attention span limitations) ."
263,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Kingsport, TN ",Dinner and a Show,"Family friendly show. Lots of fun. Skip the dinner though, it was good but not worth the $$ you pay. The play afterwards is better than the food."
264,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Faversham, UK ",A singing Barman!,"We stopped here on route from Grand Teton to Twin Falls, Idaho. We only wanted a drink and were enticed in by the great decor. We didn't eat or have time to stay for a performance in the Playhouse so please refer to other reviews which cover these. This was a pleasant and unexpected surprise in that the staff are also actors. What could be better than sitting at a bar, supping a beer whilst the Bartender and Barmaid sing cowboy songs to you! Only the lack of and draught or bottled beers (cans only) prevents this from being five stars. If you visit Jackson, you should stop off here for a drink, it's worth the experience."
265,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015 , Family,California ,"Skip Dinner, just watch the show","The building is interesting for its history, but I would recommend skipping dinner and just watch the play.  Dinner is expensive, they ask for a 9 tip per person and the worse part the food was horrible. Ribeye steak, super thin, dry nasty bread and okay vegetable. Flat soda and dessert not included. So skip dinner it's crowded and they will seat you with strangers at a small ,and I mean coffee parlor patio size small round table. The play was really good except that they made fun of the religions more then once which was unacceptable. I do not want to spend 200.00 to then have to explain to my child. The seats are horribly uncomfortable with no leg room.  The actors were awesome at their job, but the owners son was so arrogant on the street shoot out we almost didnt go just because of his attitude."
266,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Jackson, WY ","Excellent acting, good food.","I went here with a group of women for ""girls night out."" We had dinner and saw the show. The dinner was good but not outstanding. Several of us had the ribeye, which was tender and cooked as requested but was not anything special. Others had the pork with huckleberry sauce and the salmon and they said those dishes were very good. The actors are your food servers as well as entertaining you with songs while you eat. Our server was the gal who plays Truvy in the play that night, ""Steel Magnolias."" She was an absolute delight and we had a lot of laughs with her. The acting in the play was excellent and we all wondered if these were local actors or had come in from big cities. Found out afterwards it was a little of both. This was a fun evening for all of us."
267,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Silverdale, WA ",Wonderful Dinner and Show,We had dinner before the show and it was delicious! Better yet we were served by the performers and they sang several songs to us while we were dining. It really got us in the mood for the show -- Steel Magnolias. The show was filled with humor; excellent performance and couldn't have had better seats -- center in the 3rd row. I highly recommend dinner and the show if you're in Jackson.
268,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Singapore, Singapore ",Jackson Hole Playhouse,"The Playhouse is one of the oldest, if not the oldest building in Jackson Hole. Its been a Livery stable, a post office and a car dealership amongst other things. Its a must to visit if your in Jackson Hole. If there is a show on, go along. The actors are friendly and they make you feel at home in the very full atmosphere of the foyer."
269,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2015 , Friends,"London, KY, ",Absolutely the BEST thing we did while here!!!,"We went here on Labor Day, had dinner and watched the play ""Steel Magnolias"". The theater is like stepping back in time and you feel like you are part of the old west. We chose the dinner and play combo, price was $60 per adult and $34 for our child. We ordered ribeye, salmon, and chicken fingers.....all delicious! They do serve beer and wine, but were out of beer this day. They have coca cola products. The women's bathroom is so cute and feminine. I can't vouch for the mens...lol. The highlight of the night was the play. The cast were absolutely the best I have seen and we laughed and cried all in the same play! This is a must see!!!!! Small children probably wouldn't enjoy this, as sitting still and being quite is a must for others to be able to hear! This was our number one attraction while we were here for 4 days! Worth your time and money if you like plays or have never seen one and have always wanted to!!"
270,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015 , Solo,"Swanley, UK ",Seven Brides for Seven Brothers at Jackson,"What makes a visit to this theatre special?  Is it the fact that the cast is young, enthusiastic, talented and well-rehearsed? Well yes, but….  Is it the fact that the piano player also sells the tickets, the actors introduce themselves before the show, take you to your seats, note your orders for the interval, sell the popcorn and line up to wish you “safe journey” as you leave? You’re getting there, but…  Is it because they took a famous but still ridiculous musical about kidnapping women and made it believable and light hearted? They did but I have seen good theatre before and this had something different…  Back in London it become clear what they had done: Déjà vu. I have met them many times.  The Jackson Hole group are Hamlet’s travelling players; they are Mrs Jordan in Tate Wilkinson’s company; they are Dickens Crummles family and I watched them in Jack Benny’s “To Be or Not To Be”. This is a tiny, tight, talented troupe running the whole shebang on a shoestring. The only difference between them and all the other tiny artistic troupes is that they stay in Jackson instead of following the prairie schooners. They existed before gramophones, before radio, before film, before television. They are professional troupers in a grand tradition giving their all.  That is the extra they gave me when I stepped through the theatre doors: the performance began as soon as I left the boardwalk.  And if it turns out I am wrong and they only met on the net last week… even better… the play’s the thing!!  Finally we must adjust Oscar Wilde on the Leadville piano player for the Jackson piano man: “Please don’t shoot the pianist…He is actually very good and has my ticket!” Go see them before they become famous."
271,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2015 , Couples,Texas ,"""The play's the thing.....""","Thoroughly enjoyed the production of Steel Magnolias. The cast was excellent, the theater intimate (and a little stuffy), overcoming technical audio glitches that apparently could not be fixed during the show. I have little doubt that these glitches will be corrected in future performances.    The pre- show dinner was less than great. While the food was ok, the up-sell for extra cost beverages ending with extra cost desserts was a bit annoying as was the suggestion for a specific gratuity amount. The waiters sang a few songs during the meal and their talent was obvious. A suggestion for the cowboy clad singer who sang a song from the musical Rent......maybe something more appropriate for the saloon setting?    Go see the play."

I have been twice this year, and both times were extremely enjoyable. This summer's show, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, is phenomenal. The actors are hilarious, and the singing is superb. The theater itself is an older, rustic-looking building that really adds to the Western feel of the place. In all, 10 out of 10 times I would recommend the Playhouse for a memorable evening in Jackson."

The performance is heartfelt and the players are charismatic. The food was totally respectable and we felt well-attended to even with a member of our party being 5 years old. Be prepared for a community dining experience, many of the tables seat 8-10 and unless your party is that large you can expect to be seated with people you don't know, which makes for entertaining conversation."

The place has an old fashion charm, the food was good (actually better than I expected), the service is by the actors so don""t expect 5 star service but they did a very good job....plus they entertain you during dinner! We saw 7 Brides for 7 Brothers.....and the cast did a great job with the production. My only real criticism is they need to work on the sound system, only 1 or 2 of the lead actors were mic'd, so at times it was difficult to understand or hear, especially when they were dancing & facing away. Other than that we had a great time."
288,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015,not available,"Mayfield, UT ",Seven Thumbs Up,We saw Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. We had a rEarly good time. We've seen the musical several times and this was the best. We didn't try the meal.
289,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015,not available,"Sugarloaf Township, PA ","even better to watch people you""know"" perform on stage","Many of the cast members double as friendly, sociable, singing servers during the pre-show dinners and during the shoot-out at the Town Square, so I felt like I knew the people who were performing. They were surprisingly talented - I thought Howard Keel had come back to reprise his role as Adam. The inclusion of Mark, the piano player, in the action was amusing. Good idea letting people order their ice cream before the show starts so that it's ready for them at intermission!"
290,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",Fun! Entertaining! Don't Miss It!,"Do the dinner and the show. The food was delicious and the waiters are a part of the cast. Plus they sing for you during dinner. The show is outstanding. As a theater buff myself, you will be lost in the talent of the singing, the well choreographed action and the energy of every cast member. You will be amazed and depart feeling over joyed. You don't want to miss it."
291,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Richland, WA ",Fun Show!,"We loved the play but skip the dinner. We had the dinner there before the show and were not impressed and the guests waiting to see just the play stand all around you while you're eating. Feels strange. Because of the dinner experience I thought the show was not going to be any good, BUT it was great!"
292,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015 , Family, ,"Locals insisted we go. We had a fabulous time from dinner to the end of the show, the entertainment was fabulous.",I highly recommend making dinner reservations. The salmon melted in our mouths. The chef is excellent. You will especially enjoy being entertained by the staff prior to the show.
293,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2015 , Family, ,Fun Fun FUN!!,"This was a great performance!! Everyone should see it! These actresses and actors ran the whole playhouse to drinks, popcorn, and the show!! FANTASTIC!! Must See!!"
294,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015,not available, ,"Great show, don't miss it!","We took our family of seven here for ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers."" All I can say is that these actors really put their heart and soul into what they do. It was thoroughly entertaining - they all come out and sing a few songs in the lobby for a pre-show, then they personally escort you to your seats, take orders for ice cream, and then do the show. The show was enjoyable for everyone - my wife and I and ""kids"" ranging from 24 to 8, plenty of laughs for everyone, and the songs didn't get too long or boring. The seating isn't that great, fairly level, so young children might have a hard time. I would reserve in advance and try to get as close to the front as possible; even the front row is probably the best place to sit. Mild suggestiveness throughout the play, but it goes over the head of younger children."
295,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Indianapolis, IN ",Play Was Great but Skip the Dinner,"The show Seven Brides was outstanding. Very well done for summer theatre. The actors looked like they were all into their roles and the pianist was great. Skip the meal before hand which was mediocre at best. I also thought it was a scam that they suggested a $9 tip per person for the meal. Our family of give cost about $110 to feed as part of the package with another $150 for our tickets. I wouldn't tip $45 for our meal and I thought it was disingenuous to given us a bill for $265 and ask for a $45 tip. Do they ask people who just bought their tickets to tip, I doubt it. Didn't Take away from a great show but do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere before hand."
296,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Couples,"McMurray, PA ","Great production, very good meal, lots of fun!","We saw ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" on our last night in town. The dinner theater is decorated to look like an old cowboy saloon. You can have dinner (which we did) prior to the show or just buy show tickets. The entire even was well organized by the staff so that all ticket holders were fed efficiently and in time to see the show. There were 5 (I think) meal choices and all the parties in our group felt they were served nicely and very tasty. The staff is well trained and efficient. The servers actually sing during dinner which adds a bit of fun and a festive atmosphere. The play is excellent. The actors have great enthusiasm and the theater is small enough for everyone to be up close to the stage and the actors. The seats are even reasonably comfortable. The story is fun - the music is good - and the entire evening makes you laugh and feel good. We felt it was fairly priced for both the dinner and theater performance. You certainly couldn't beat this show for an evening in a cowboy town!"
297,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Macon, Georgia, United States ",A definite MUST SEE!!!!,"I traveled to Jackson Hole with my 2 teenage boys and my husband in July. On a whim, I got tickets to see Seven Brides for Seven Brothers after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor. Boy am I ever glad I did!!!! The dinner was delicious - 2 of us had steak, 1 son the pasta and my husband the salmon. We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Our pretty waitress Maggie told us she was Ruth in the play. We loved when the wait staff burst out in song and it was even more fun when Maggie sang ""I fall to pieces"" and serenaded my oldest! What was really neat was we felt like we knew some of the members in the cast by the time we got in the play. Wow does this cast work hard - they all looked like acrobats by the time it was all over with their flips, dance moves and running around. It was thoroughly entertaining and you can tell that they all love what they are doing. Later in the week we finally got to see the shoot out in the square at 6:00 and it was fun to see the cast again - we felt like they were old friends by then. I can't say enough about what a fun night this was for all of us! A definite must see when you are in Jackson Hole!"
298,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015,not available,"Arlington, TN ","Fun, Fun, Fun",The entire family had a great time at the show. The actors were so much fun to watch and the pianist was a show all by himself. We loved the way the actors were in the lobby after the show so we could meet them all. Great time.
299,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Lewes, Delaware, United States ",Great evening and dinner,"We have been to Jackson many times and this was the first time we tried the Jackson Playhouse. It was simply fantastic. We saw Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and the entire evening was so enjoyable. The actors were great and quite professional and we enjoyed the dinner before the play which was top notch. The food was equal to any good restaurant we ate in on our trip. Don't know how we missed this fun place but I know that on any future trips, we will include an evening at the Jackson Playhouse. Don't miss it and definitely have dinner there."
300,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Fort Mill, SC ",Great place. Oldest JH building,We loved the the interior of this old saloon and what appeared to be an old hotel lobby. Everything still looks like the original establishment. Too bad they don't advertise being in the oldest original building in JH. The service staff are all actors from the play that is presented each night. We enjoyed the buffalo burgers which were delicious. Our waiter started singing Moon River and walking around the dining area. He was great and a very personable young man. We enjoyed our lunch in this unique place.
301,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Huffman, TX ",A fun dinner and play event!,"Our group of 8 decided to attend the dinner and following show of ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"". Dinner is a smaller set menu, but all of the options were very tasty. They also served a delicious strawberry salad as an appetizer with rolls served with herbed butter - these were great as well! The servers were also performers in the show, and they sang songs throughout the dinner service. The pre-show began at 7:30 in the lobby, and it set the stage for local, engaging entertainment. The play was great, engaging even my 6 and 7 year olds, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this experience to visitors!"
302,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Ada, MI ","Fun Stop for the Family, Great Talent","A nice break from the shopping. We had a group tour lunch here but likely the dinner is similar with a limited selection but staff singing during the courses. Would have liked to stay for the show and those who did said they were surprised by the talent and really enjoyed it. Minnie's Salad and Burger both good, with rolls and salad and Huckleberry Ice Cream for dessert. The atmosphere was great and a fun Western Family experience."
303,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Dallas, TX ","Every year, great camp for kids",A week long summer camp (day camp) where they craft a play to include kids of any age and talent. Our kids LOVE it and we love the performance at the end of a week!
304,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Couples,New Jersey ,Superb Evening at the Jackson Hole Playhouse,"We chose the dinner/show option at the Playhouse and could not have been happier with our wonderful evening. The dinner was fine- a fun setting in an old fashioned saloon with the evening's actors as our wait staff. ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" was terrific entertainment garnering rave reviews from everyone who was there."
305,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",A wonderful show!,"We enjoy live theater, so we try to see local theater in our travels when we can. Most of the shows we see are on Broadway, but regional theater often reflects the uniqueness of the town and we often enjoy these shows. This production of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was excellent! The actors were enthusiastic and talented. The show included energetic and creative choreography, including a slow motion fighting seen and acrobatic dancing. This was really a treat and the perfect ending for our time in Jackson."
306,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Twin Falls, ID ",Another great play!,"We come here every year to see the plays. They are always fun, almost always family friendly and great entertainment!"
307,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Denver, CO ","Corny, sort of, but what fun....","Sure the dinner/playhouse scenario sort of went by the wayside years ago but the Jackson Hole Playhouse takes it a step up by having singing waiters/waitress's who appear in the play and are friendly, have interesting personal stories and I suppose have a ""natural niceness.""  The play we saw was Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and had excellent acting, choreography and music. It was a wonderful professional performance that ended with a standing ovation from the audience.  The food service prior to the show was very good. The selection choice was great, served promptly and the desert was to die for."
308,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Brenham, TX ",Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"We attended Seven Brides for Seven Brothers this past Monday night. The theater was small so you could see well. It was a little warm inside, but the show was well worth it. The actors were wonderful! Their singing and dancing was wonderful and so was the choreography! We also had dinner there and the actors were the waiters and did singing during it. The theater is in the oldest building in Jackson Hole and is Beautiful. It looks like something out of the old west. One thing that was great about it was that it was family friendly. We will be going back the next time we are there."
309,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Friends,"Sedona, AZ ",FUN SHOW IN AN HISTORIC THEATRE,"We went to see Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I was a bit skeptical because I love the movie and have seen it many times. However, the cast put on a great show with some additional songs that weren't in the movie. Adam's character was wonderful - a great voice and stage presence. Lots of great singing and dancing. Recommend it."
310,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Beaver Dam, WI ",Seven brides for Seven Brothers,Great show. Amazing what the actors can accomplish on a small stage. High energy & professional. Dinner good with great tableside entertainment. A little warm in the theater when it was 75 outside. Wish they had more/any AC or ventilation.
311,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Couples, ,Great fun!,"I attended Seven Brides for Seven brothers this past Monday night. The air conditioner was broken so although it was very uncomfortable for a while, the cast did a great job of keeping me distracted with their talent. It's a very small theater so every seat is a good seat. They were great singers and dancers and the choreography was great! We really enjoyed it!"
312,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2015 , Family,"Crystal Lake, IL, ","Performance Great, Theater Age Challenges","I see a lot of performances in the Chicago area, the performance was great and the set was amazing for local theater! I would give ***** on that!    Challenges with old theater:  1. Poor slope for seating. Hard for adults so see around the head in front of them. Several children moved to back rows so they can sit on seat back.    2. Leg space, I am 5' 10... very squished knees."
313,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Galveston, TX ",We Loved It,We see lots of musical productions each year and this group did a great show. We bought the package with the dinner and enjoyed our evening very much. Their production of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was really fun. What a talented group! We would go to all the shows if we lived in the area
314,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Redondo Beach, California, United States ",Blew us all away,"My family of 7, including a child under 3, came for dinner and a show, (7 Brides for 7 Brothers) in June. Frankly I don't know what level of performance we were expecting but we all walked away totally amazed. Dinner was very good and enhanced by the performers also acting as wait staff and mid-meal entertainment. The production itself only suffered by some volume problems in the first act but otherwise used space creatively and made the most of every part of the theater.    Between dinner service, a lot of dancing, slides, fight choreography and audience interaction, these are incredibly hard working people who have simply done a tremendous job. Well worth the money."
315,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Lindon, UT ",Best reason to visit Jackson,I have been visiting the Jackson Hole playhouse for 33yrs straight. Even as a child it was my favorite thing about Jackson Hole. The plays are so fun well done and they are very entertaining. Even my young children now love to sit and see the plays. They are very family friendly and welcome little ones. I strongly suggest making Jackson Hole playhouse a part of your trip to Jackson Wyoming. You will absolutely love it. Make sure to be there in time for the pre show. We love doing that as much as the play.
316,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Victoria, TX ",Broadway Caliber!,The dinner theater was entertaining from the first step into the saloon to the standing ovation at the end of the play. The meal was delicious and set in a renovated saloon. The actors were the wait staff and dressed as saloon girls and cowboys. They were very efficient and entertaining. We loved the singing they performed in amongst the serving. The actors had auditioned for summer stock at universities of theater. The play Seven Brides for Seven Brothers was absolutely fantastic. As good as anything I have viewed on Broadway or London.
317,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Fishers, IN ",Tremendous Family Entertainment,"Last week we attended Seven Brides for Seven Brothers at the Jackson Hole Playhouse. I wasn't sure if my kids would like it, but they really did. My girls (13 and 11) loved the songs, but what surprised me was that my son (6) liked it as well.  The cast did a great job. They were all gifted singers and actors and put their hearts into the performance. It's well worth your time and money to attend. When we get back to Jackson this will be near the top of our lists of places to visit."
318,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Carol Stream, IL ",A must see!,"Our family attended this great show in Jackson!. My son age 12 and daughter age 10 laughed through the entire production. The malts, shakes and ice cream sundaes during intermission were also a big hit with us. The slow motion dance sequence and other dances numbers were incredible! This so far exceeded our expectations. A great way to spend your evening."
319,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Ogden, UT ",Whole family enjoyed this play!!!,"We took our four kids ages 16, 13, 11, and 4. I have to admit I was worried about my 16 year old son and thought he might wonder why in the world I would take him to a play. He loved it along with the rest of them! We had so much fun and thoroughly enjoyed this night and activity in Jackson! My kids are still talking about it!"
320,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jun 2015 , Family,"Lavonia, GA ",Outstanding - Worth Every Penny,"My wife, kids (14, 7, and 5) and I saw Seven Brides for Seven Brothers in June. It was hilarious and well done. My two young boys were not excited about going but they watched, laughed, and clapped all the way through. The theater is small and historic; i'm amazed they were able to pull off this production. The slow motion dance number in the first act was one of a kind. I have seen and done a lot of things in Jackson and often say ""Well that was good, but was it really worth all that money?"" as everyone knows Jackson can be pricey, but this was not the case at the playhouse. Hands down best money we spent in Jackson."

All of us enjoy theater and have attended performances from the pros in London and Broadway to college productions to local theater. JHP is an old theater steeped in western ambience. We had an enjoyable meal as we were serenaded by several showgirls and a cowboy. Thereafter, our expectations were greatly exceeded by the lively, raucous, well-choreographed performance of this western set musical. We were in awe at the talent as well as the enthusiasm and energy that took place on this small stage. Attendees throughout the audience appeared to agree. We enjoyed the theater's whole family taking part in the operation and entertainment. This was a highlight of an outstanding 9 day trip to Jackson Hole and Yellowstone. An all-ages performance well worth the price of admission."

It was delightful! The food was very good, the play was wonderful and the overall charm was nothing short of fabulous! I would recommend a visit for families, children of all ages, couples, singles, great for everyone! The cast are also your servers and it is so intimate and charming."

They 3 stars interacted with the audience at this dinner and show. The food was out of this world. The rib eye steak was huge. The salmon was moist and the sauce was great. Our daughter was invited to be part of the play. If you are in Jackson Hole don't miss the playhouse!
325,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Dec 2014,not available,TEXAS ,A Jackson hole Christmas,I was awed by the beautiful reception area. The antiques and beautiful Christmas decorations instantly filled me with Christmas spirit. The dinner was excellent. Lots of food. The cast and staff were so much fun. They were all very talented. This is definitely a great venue. We went as a family and all of us enjoyed every aspect. A must do in jackson hole
326,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Jul 2014 , Friends,"Centennial, CO, ",fantastic talent & dinner,Went to Paint Your Wagon. It started with a pre show. all the performers are your wait staff and are dressed up for the show. The dinner was fantastic and they give you a lot of food. The performers (wait staff & bartenders) sing while you enjoy your dinner. They are very talented and have amazing voices. after dinner you get a little break (while they clean up) so we went to the wort hotel for a drink because they do not serve alcohol. We returned for the show and it was fantastic. They also give you an intermission where you can go get soft drinks & popcorn... I highly recommend putting this on your itenerary.
327,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Charleston, SC ",Talent plus enthusiasm= great entertainment,"Spouse and I recently enjoyed a performance of ""Paint Your Wagon."" The venue, at age 99, is showing its age and welcomes donations to help restore it. That said, the talent and enthusiastic performances of the cast overshadowed the location. There was not a weak voice in the ensemble, the youngest performer of which was ~ 17. Meeting the cast after the performance was an unexpected plus."
328,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Webster, NY ",Consider where these folks are,"Consider where these folks are and how much they probably pay their talent, the actors and singers were fantastic. We saw Paint your wagon for $32/ each. It was great. It started with a pre-show in the lobby and then the actors seated us. It started on time and the singing was a pleasant surprise. They were really, really good. We did just the show but a dinner and show combo was offered."
329,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2014 , Solo,"Greenville, SC ",Paint Your Wagon,"I found out about this thru tripadvisor and the reviews. Great evening! Fun time almost from the time I walked in. Dinner was great! I had the salmon with wild rice & stir fry of squash and peppers. It was delish! The milk pie was also great, with homemade whipped cream...yum!  The entertainment was very good, both during the meal and the show.The entertainers were there just for the summer and most were from New York. Christine was my waitress & was in the play...super sweet young lady!  I was impressed with the owner, Vicki Garnick, who welcomed each person personally.  As far as the price, $60, I thought it was reasonable for both a show and dinner. I liked having the tip already suggested. the suggested tip was not only at JHP, but at each restaurant in JH. Tips were how the entertainers made money & I felt they worked really hard...so it was worth the price.  I will definately return to see another show!!!"
330,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2014 , Couples,"West Fargo, ND ","Ok, not great","My husband I chose this attraction thinking it would be a fun, different, way to spend an evening. It was definitely different, and mildly amusing, but not as much fun as I had hoped.    The people were very friendly and helpful, both when we stopped in to purchase our tickets and the evening of the show. The food was ok, nothing to jump up and down about. If we had it to do again, I would recommend skipping dinner and just going to the show. We both chose the ribeye, which was served with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. The potatoes and salad were the highlight. The veggies were an overcooked combo of chopped up red peppers and onions with a couple slices of squash mixed in. The servers occasionally broke out into song and did a nice job of engaging the guests. That was definitely a highlight over the food. (Although both singers were a bit flat, so not as good as it could have been.)    One thing that surprised me was their ""suggested gratuity"" of $9/person. We paid $60 each for the dinner and show combo. I heard them tell someone the show alone was $32. That means the meal was $18, thus the recommended tip was 50%. That's ridiculous! We don't typically tip on show tickets, so that greediness is appalling. Bottom line is that we spent a total of $71 each for a marginal dinner and show.    The show was mildly entertaining, although the singers were mostly flat then as well. (Maybe the music is just written that way, I found it disappointing either way.)    I was disappointed in where they seated us for the musical. The theater had only 4 rows (out of at least 15-20 total) with people in them, yet they put us in the middle of a side aisle rather than in the center where we could have seen the entire stage. As I said, very disappointing.    My advice? Skip the meal and go have pizza somewhere. If you still choose to go to the show, make sure to request seats in the center. Don't settle for whatever they give you."
331,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Aug 2014 , Couples,Madison ,Enjoyable Evening,"Enjoyed the Dinner and the show. Didn't enjoy my seat in the theater, the springs were bad but the show kept me entertained. There were young children there that night and I wouldn't recommend it for them. They were bored and parents ended up leaving early. Next time we take a trip this way we will take in another Dinner & Show."
332,Jackson_Hole_Playhouse,Sep 2014 , Couples,Sonoma County ,Fun,A very dedicated group of professionals putting on a variety of plays. Dinner and the play was a fun experience. Actors interact with the diners before the play.

The cast meet and greet you, throw themselves into Paint Your Wagon with gusto and really do entertain! It is certainly not the West End or Broadway but definitely worth a night out in Jackson. We were warned not to have supper there, so just took in the show, but we really enjoyed it."
