0,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2021,not available, ,Breathtaking lake and Grand Teton views. Loved the hiking and all the beautiful scenery.,Beautiful lake and hiking trails. Breathtaking views and water falls. Signage was excellent. The boat trip over was fun too. Loved everything about it.
1,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021,not available, ,amazing view,"the hike was a workout to the lookout peak due to not being conditioned for attitude. the view from lookout was awesome. there is a hidden waterfall, a moose with her calf. a boat that will take you to and from waterfall at a charge. kayaking, swimming. a must see like all of Yellowstone. there are hidden gems everywhere."
2,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2021 , Couples,"Spring Hill, TN, ",Breathtaking. Beautiful. Inspiring.,We stopped at Jenny Lake (scenic overlook) for a few hours on our Grand Teton NPS excursion — so glad we did. We got off the main north-south road (Teton Park Road) and took a less traveled route into a one-way lane going by the Jenny Lake Lodge — leading to the Scenic Overlook. Great location to walk part of the trail as well as views of the GTNP. By far our highlight of our weeklong trip.
3,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2021,not available, ,Gorgous,This was truly a beautiful sight. A storm was rolling in and made it even more glorious. I can see where it would be totally peaceful had it not been for the storm!
4,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"St. George, UT ",A Lif-Long Love Affair,"After many years, I returned to a place visited in my youth and held dear for more than 60 years.    The plan to visit Jenny Lake in the Grand Teton National Park visit after dark on a night of a full-moon was prevented by the overwhelming smoke from the western fires, so the visit occurred in mid-morning, prime visiting time for the full hoard of tourists.    Despite the crowd, the view is still spectacular. And I am even more reassured that my love for that magical lake is based in reality, not just the memory of a long-ago teenager.    To share that love, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND a visit to Jenny Lake in the Grand Teton National Park!"
5,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"San Antonio, TX ",Worth the Visit!,"If you're wondering about taking the boat - yes - do it! We weren't sure, but so glad we stood in line for an hour. It was great to be able to hike to inspiration point and other spots from that point. Great!"
6,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"Chicago, IL ",way too many people,seriously do yourself a favor and don't even attempt this any time after 6a. It's ridiculously overcrowded.
7,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"Nashville, TN ",Clear Water,This was the best part of the Tetons. We took the loop to the visitor center and stopped and parked along the way. We hiked to the shore and watched the boat tour come across the lake. The visitor center parking was very busy and cars were parked a mile away. The water is very clear for a lake. It was somewhat like Lake Tahoe.
8,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021 , Friends,"Louisville, KY ",Beautifuk,Beautiful place. Highly recommend taking the boat across the lake and taking a short hike to the waterfall or continue past the water fall to inspiration point and another waterfall. Don’t recommend going over on rainy weather. If there is lightening then the boats stop running and you have to hike back 2.5 miles or 5.0 miles
9,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ",My Favorite Part of Grand Teton Park,"Jenny Lake is likely one of the first stops you will make when entering the park. If you enter from Moose, this is the first spot to stop inside the park. They have a visitor center, bathrooms, hiking trails, etc. Because it's so close to the entrance, parking can be a little tough, so be prepared to park along the road and walk to the lake. The lake offers amazing views, especially of the Tetons. We hiked along the Jenny Lake Trail all the way to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. If you don't want to hike as far, you can take a ferry boat to the other side and then it's just a short walk to the falls and Inspiration Point. The hike was my favorite part of our visit though, so I would highly recommend it. I will also review the trail and the two stopping points in separate reviews."
10,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2021,not available,"Arlington, VA, ",Jenny Lake Views,Jenny Lake is full of wonderful views. We made several stops around the lake to see the lake - mountain contrasts. We also enjoyed the beautiful flowers and other scenery.
11,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021,not available, ,Most amazing hike,Take the boat to the back country. Hike to Hidden Falls. I had foot surgery last year. The hike was worth it!
12,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021 , Family,"Denison, TX ",Breathtaking!!!,"I have always been told that Jenny Lake is one of the most beautiful areas in the USA, and it didn’t disappoint!!! We were there with our 3 teens & they all loved it!!! It’s so beautiful!!!"
13,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA ",Jenny is a Stunner!,Jenny Lake has everything! The lake is stunning and the hike to the falls is gorgeous!  Take the boat ride to the other side of the lake and save your energy to hike all the way to the top after you’ve seen the falls.  ARRIVE EARLY! Parking is very limited and fills up fast.
14,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"Austin, TX ",Go early to beat the crowds! Beautiful hike and scenery!,"Jenny Lake is a beautiful place to visit in GTNP. Make sure to go early in the day if you are planning to take the ferry across the lake to the trails for Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. Parking becomes a challenge later in the morning. We arrived at 7:30 AM and the parking lot was filling up fast. By the time we returned to our car around 11 AM, the parking lot was full."
15,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2021 , Family,"Elk Grove, CA ",Definitely visit if you’re in Grand Teton NP,"We went to Jenny Lake and took a boat to the mountains for a hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. We went on Father’s Day and got there around 11am and the parking was crazy! There is a huge parking lot, but even that was full and people were parking out on the road and walking in. I highly recommend getting there early. It costs $50 for a family of 4 to go round trip on the boat. Even though it was a busy day, it only took us 20-30 minutes to pay and get on the boat. The boats run frequently. The way back we waited about 15 minutes, so that was nice. We had 4 little ones with us, so the hikes took quite a bit of time, but they were fun and very beautiful. It was definitely a fun thing to do in Grand Teton NP."
16,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2021,not available,Minneapolis ,"Chilly swim, gorgeous water","Hike away from the busy visitor's center toward String Lake. There are several off-shoots from the hiking path that lead to tiny, perfect beaches. We spent a couple of hours at one, swimming in the gorgeously clear water (yes, it's freezing), skipping rocks and just playing. It was my favorite day of our whole trip. Of course, if you can snag a campsite, do. That's the best way to avoid the insane crowds!"
17,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2021,not available,"Virginia Beach, VA, ",Jenny Lake is Massive !!,"Jenny Lake is massive and expansive. Its part of the culture of Grand Teton Mountain Range. There are hiking trails, walking paths, and look outs for photo opportunities. They have a gift shop as well and we bought some trinkets. If you book in advance, you can take a boat cruise around the lake."
18,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2021 , Family,"Muscle Shoals, AL ",Breathtaking views,Jenny Lake is a must see if you are at the Grand Tetons. Ferry over and hike to the hidden falls or the overlook. Trail walk back and enjoy all that nature has to offer. Clean. Helpful staff.
19,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2021,not available,"Austin, TX, ",This is a MUST SEE!,"If you have time for nothing else, you MUST make a stop at Jenny Lake! Pictures do not do it justice. Be sure to walk the short loop around the lake. Simply breathtaking!"
20,Jenny_Lake,May 2021,not available, ,"Gorgeous views, nice hike and beautiful!!","Take the shuttle across or hike to Hidden falls and Inspiration Pointe! Small price for the shuttle and worth the time to see everything! Beautiful, I will definitely go again."
21,Jenny_Lake,May 2021,not available,"Charleston, SC ",Super Spot for Waterfalls and Rapids,Took the Jenny Lake Shuttle to the Cascade Valley trail. Proceeded to trek to the Hidden Falls. Great visuals and staggering vistas
22,Jenny_Lake,May 2021 , Couples,"Springdale, AR ",Boat ride across Lake Jenny to Hidden Falls,What a gem of a spot in the Tetons! We rode the boat over to the other side a d hiked up to Hidden Falls. Wow!!! Worth the hike!!!
23,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2020 , Couples,"Johnson City, TN, ",Most beautiful,I don’t know when I’ve seen anything this breathtaking. The water was so still the mountains and trees were reflected perfectly in the lake. One morning we drove in super early from Idaho Falls so we would be able to stand at the Jenny Lake overlook with our sandwich and coffee and watch quietly as the sun rose. Yes I cried.
24,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020,not available,Detroit ,Gorgeous,Jenny lake is absolutely beautiful. the water is crisp and cool and clean and refreshing! We walked a few trails around the lake and swam for a bit and had a mini-picnic as a 'rest' on our day through/around the Tetons
25,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2020,not available,"Alpharetta, GA, ",Beautiful lake offers great views of the Tetons,"This is a beautiful lake, with easy access from Jackson.    Lots of parking near the Visitor’s Center, where we found informative Rangers.    Very good signage and a well-marked trails.    A jumping off point for the boat to the other side of the lake or for the trail that leads to Inspiration point."
26,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2020 , Family,"Indianapolis, IN ",Sunrise spectacular,So beautiful I wanted to cry. We went at sunrise at took in the most serene gorgeous sights! The way the images reflected off the water was breathtaking. The lake was large and very clean. The trail around the lake was a popular hike.
27,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2020,not available,"Vidalia, LA ",Beautiful,"A must see on your trip to the Tetons. Beautiful scenery, We used Gypsy Guide and didn’t miss a thing!"
28,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020,not available,"Houston, TX, ",You can take the ferry to Hidden Falls / Inspiration Point Trailhead,"You can walk along Jenny Lake or you can take the ferry. We chose to take the ferry to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point trailhead. We showed up at the Jenny Lake boat dock at 4 pm on a Saturday (8/29). Paid $18 per person round trip using a credit card. We got on the boat (masks required) within 10 minutes. The boat ride took another 10 minutes. We started our hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point at 4:20 pm. We completed the 2 miles round trip in 2 hours.    If you try to catch the boat back in the afternoon, the line can be very long. By the time we caught the ferry around 6:30 pm, there wasn't much of a wait and in 10 minutes we were back at the Jenny Lake boat dock."
29,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2020,not available, ,Jenny Lake Hiking,"Recommend hiking the 3 miles along Jenny Lake and viewing the lake and beautiful scenery along the way to Hidden falls & Inspiration point and then taking the short boat trip back. Remember to pack snacks, water or lunch for when you get to Inspiration point to rest and take in the gorgeous view of the lake and valley below."
30,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2020 , Family,"Houston, TX ",Beautiful lake and trails! A must In grand Tetons!,Decided to hike the counterclockwise 5 plus mile route from visitor center to Inspiration point which was beautiful with lovely views of the Tetons and lake. Wonderful hike! Unfortunately we started late and hit the boat ramp around 3. Too late to do Inspiration point and the hidden falls because we found it was an hour wait for the boat! We skipped the point and falls cause I was already hiked out! But Instead of waiting for the boat we decided to just keep hiking around the lake to the end. Ended up something like 9 miles!! Wow! Next time I would take the shuttle over and do the longer route back for the better views and try not to miss Inspiration point or hidden falls!
31,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020,not available, ,Great location,Was a beautiful view driving the Jenny Lake road. Loved the turnout to get some pictures of the Tetons. It was a beautiful day and the mountains and the lake looked absolutely stunning. We could have stayed longer than the few hours we had.
32,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2020,not available,"Atlanta, Georgia ",Nice boat ride & hike,"Ride the boat to take a nice hike over to Inspiration Point. We opted to hike back to the visitors center. The trail back was rocky & uneven. If I went again, I would ride the boat back."
33,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2020 , Family,"Denver, CO ",Must do!!,"So beautiful!!! Crowded over Labor Day. Got here around 11:00 and found parking half mile away. Ferry was fun - quick getting over to the other side of lake to hike, but half hour line to get back, so plan accordingly. Hidden Falls and Inspiration point are a must. Take plenty of water and a picnic after your hike. Our kids swam for a bit afterwards. Must do."
34,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020,not available,"Chanhassen, MN, ",Get There Early,Beautiful lake at the base of the mountains offers up plenty of hiking both on the lodge side and across the lake via boat shuttle. Water is super clean and clear and made for an awesome quick swim. Get there early as the parking lot is huge but fills up fast.
35,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Hoover, AL ",Beautiful!!,"Great hike!! We hiked to Hidden falls and then caught boat back! I thought it was going to be an easy hike but there was some moderate uphill climbing and frankly when we got to the falls , another hiker told us the hike to the top of the falls was very challenging! We didn’t go all the way up for that reason. Well worth a few hours in the Tetons!!"
36,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020,not available, ,MUST DO - unbelievable beauty,This is such a beautiful place and there is a boat you can pay to take across the lake and do some GREAT hiking. Go to the bathroom on the embarkation point BEFORE you go. No toilets on the other side.
37,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020,not available,"Plainfield, IL ",Get here EARLY to get parking,"We parked at Jenny Lake at 8AM and took the ferry (there is a fee) across to get on the hiking trails to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. You can also hike around the Jenny Lake loop and still go up to Inspiration Point. It is a very short boat ride and the line was very long because they are only running at half capacity per boat due to COVID. For us, it was still worth it because we did not want to expel much energy getting to the bottom of Inspiration Point since we wanted to make it UP to Inspiration Point. The parking was pure madness when we got out - folks were parking down the street for miles, so I am glad we got here early."
38,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020 , Couples,"Madison, MS ",Beautiful lake and hike,We hiked up to inspiration point and then caught the shuttle boat back. The shuttle isn’t free on the return. They collect your money after the trip. The elevation isn’t too bad for beginners. I had to stop and catch my breath on the inclines but that’s more about me. It’s an easy- moderate hike. Well marked. It was a little crowded at times but not where you couldn’t enjoy it.
39,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020,not available,"Spokane, WA, ","Beautiful Lake, be sure to do the boat ride if you can","We really enjoyed the Beauty of Jenny Lake we loved it so much we came back a second day to hike a second time. Even if you can not hike, stop get a bite to eat and enjoy the view at one of the picnic areas. You will be in awe as we were. We didn't want to leave and I bet you won't want to either."
40,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2020,not available,"Frederick, MD ","Short Hike, great views.",You will need bear spray. Hike is not difficult with trail. Come early for best parking near lake. Scenic views make for great place to stop on great tour.
41,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2020,not available,"Council Bluffs, Iowa ",Gorgeous hike!,We did the hike from the welcome center to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. It was about 6 miles total and we had a blast! Gorgeous views of the lake and the Tetons throughout the hike.
42,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2020,not available,"Glenville, NY ",Great boat ride and hike back.,"Take the boat across, see the hidden waterfall and hike back. Such a great experience and beautiful lake."
43,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2020,not available,"Gainesville, GA ",Take the boat ride,"We enjoyed our boat ride across Jenny Lake and hike to the Hidden Waterfalls. It was raining a bit, but we did not let that stop us. It is just beautiful."
44,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2020 , Couples,"Indianapolis, IN ",Pure peacefulness,"The water is so clean and beautiful. I knew it was going to be cold but that didn’t stop me from getting in. It was nice too cool off after a long hike. I wore shoes because the rocks along the shoreline where I got in where slippery. I highly recommend swimming in the lake. The water was so crisp, clear and invigorating."
45,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2020 , Couples,"Las Vegas, Nevada ",Beautiful,"Such a great place. We hiked half to the falls but our adult children hiked it all and did see black. Ear. We took the boat trip back, boats running every 10 minutes. Accommodate a lot of people to see beautiful area."
46,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2020,not available,"Kingwood, TX ",very pretty,"The park is beautiful. LOTS of traffic. Lots of RVs. Do not feel like you have to take pictures from the highway; there are turn offs on the mountain side of the highway. Watch for wildlife, turning vehicles and slow cars. Watch for FOOT traffic crossing the road. Pay attention to the signs because they could really use MORE signs out there.    WE SAW BEARS IN THE DISTANCE!!"
47,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2020,not available,"Fort Collins, CO ",The most beautiful place I have ever been on our planet,"We visited here a couple of years back but got much more time here on this trip. Got the ferry over, then hiked to Hidden Falls and Inspiration point before hiking back to the visitor center.    There are points on the journey where you stop in open-mouthed astonishment at the scenery - it is exceptional."
48,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2020,not available,"Denver, CO ",very good job,"I took the shuttle ferry and at 500pm ,I took the scenic ferry cruise, those guys, they knew,what they are doing, real good job, I have not complaint at all, at end of the end,was very tired with the hiking I did, and believe me ,I slept so good that night,"
49,Jenny_Lake,Mar 2020,not available,"Yekaterinburg, Russia, ",Formed by glaciers,"About 12,000 years ago the 78 metre deep lake and its terminal moraine were formed by moving glaciers. Very scenic area. with wonderful refreshing air."
50,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Charlottetown, Canada, ",Great visit,Beautiful lake in the Tetos. Drive the loop hike around or get out in a boat. Something for everyone to do even just put your toes in.
51,Jenny_Lake,May 2019,not available, ,Drive the Jenny Lake Loop,"This is a drive that shouldn’t be missed. When you arrive at the lake overlook, you simply must stop. The view across the lake is stunning. Any season of the year is perfect (except when closed in winter). My recommendation is to go just when the park opens for the year... ice floating on the lake with the Tetons draped in snow. Wow! Just be aware that lots of others want to enjoy the view, as well."
52,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available, ,Wonderful views.,There are some great pull outs that you need to watch for and drive around the Jenny lake area. One of our favorite areas to visit around the tetons.
53,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Haifa, Israel, ",A piece of beauty,"Jenny Lake is a gem of beauty in Grand Teton National Park, and it is recommended for anyone who comes to the park to visit the lake. You can rent a Kayak or canoe, as we did, and cruise the lake, you can walk the beautiful 7-8 mile trail around the lake (we did part of it), you can swim in the lake, and you can picnic. Don't miss it!"
54,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Valhalla, NY, ",Nice if the weather is right,So on our stop here when traveling from Yellowstone to Jackson it was raining and overcast. You could make out little to none of the Grand Teton's. It was still a nice view and stop but probably would have been 100% better if it was a bright sunny cloudless day.
55,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2019 , Family, ,Greatest Trip Ever!!,"Still trying to catch my breath!!! Words fail me...But these memories will last a lifetime...p l u s !!! Please for ur own sake visit & c a world wrapped in majesty,beauty,wonder,& awesomeness so great...U will be asking urself again & again..was that real...or just the best dream ever?!?"
56,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Franklin, NC, ",We never tire of this spot. It's like Lake Louise of the US.,"One of the prettiest spots in the USA. Our 3rd visit over the many decades and it never gets old. We compare it to Lake Louise in Alberta for the sheer beauty, just minus the lake's color. Definitely stop here if you have any doubts. The loop road is easy."
57,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Gainesville, FL ",My Favorite Place On Earth,"I have visited three times over the last four years, and Jenny Lake remains my favorite place on earth. Peaceful. Gorgeous. Restore your body, mind, and soul. I could hike there or just sit for hours."
58,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Sydney, Australia ",Beautiful,Easily our most favourite view in all of Grand Teton NP. It is just so so beautiful. There is a parking lot right on the lookout. Gets busy but its just the most gorgeous view. Didn't want to leave.
59,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Portland, OR ",Jenny Lake,"Took the round trip ""taxi"" and spent sometime on hiking on the other side of the lake.Lovely afternoon and less expensive than the scenic cruise."
60,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Venice, United States ",Jenny Lake Scenic Tour one hour,"This tour takes you right up to the base of the Teton Mts--Grand Teton, Mt Teewinot, Mt Owen ... which are just spectacular!! Our guide was great and shared his love for this magnificent area while teaching us all about it! This is a must do!!"
61,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Modesto, CA ",Beautiful,"Jenny Lake is beautiful on it’s own but having the Tetons as a backdrop,wow.  The parking lot can be crowded but people are coming and going frequently.  We saw kayakers and there’s a shuttle that takes you across the lake to the Hidden Falls trailhead.  You have to stop here and get some cool pictures."
62,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available, ,Very pretty lake with trail options and ferry option.,Really pretty views at this little lake with a ferry option across. Trails available around lake. The hike up to the falls is strenuous and even the hike to Moose Pond was a bit steep at the end....but beautiful views abound!
63,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Grand Junction, CO ",Beautiful hike,"This is a beautiful lake with great hiking. There are lots of tourists clogging the views but if you hike around it, it’s very pleasant. It’s a mild hike but you’re at altitude and there’s rocks to scramble over so it does get your heart rate up and get you sweating. There’s also critters, like bears, so you have to pay attention. I was glad I had hiking boots on bc it had recently rained and it was slick in several spots. Follow the directions on the signs for sunscreen, water and bear spray and you’ll be fine. Leave the stupid bells at home they’re useless. Bring a loud whistle and remember to spray toward the feet with the bear spray so he gets it in the face when he drops to chase you. Have fun!"
64,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Farmington, MI ",great hike,We did the hike to the waterfall. It took us about 2 1/2 hours to complete. It was a beautiful hike and there was a section that was a little dangerous but other than that it was great. I am 62 years old and I was able to do this hike with no problem. We did take the boat ride back.
65,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Bossier City, LA ",A must do,"We opted to take the ferry across the lake and hike back around the lake due to time constraints. The hike is about 2 miles but it will take you a good hour and a half. Elevation changes, water fall, rushing creeks, and moose in the area known as moose junction. Not a hard walk but it does take a little while."
66,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Carmel, CA ",Hike part of lake,"A beautiful lake to hike to or around. We took about a 3 mile hike and saw the beautiful lake, not to mention a family of moose. Very easy hiking/walking but very picturesque!"

68,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Huntington, WV ",Stunning views,"Hiked along Jenny Lake through Hidden Falls, Inspiration point and up Cascade Canyon. The views are amazing. We started early and saw a bear and a moose along the trail. Hike is moderate with a good variety of scenery - lake, woods, mountain stream, falls and canyon. One of the highlights of our trip."
69,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"London, UK ",Fantastic location,"We took the boat over the lake and walked up to Inspiration point and then back round the lake. The boat trip was fast and smooth and the views at the top were well worth the effort of climbing up! We then walked back round the lake to the visitor centre, taking a small detour to Moose pond to see a family of moose eating in the water. I would highly recommend this walk which had fantastic views in what can only be described as incredible scenery."

72,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Bellevue, WA ",Peaceful and serene!,"Sadly we only had time to stop and look, take photos. The lake is absolutely stunning. Would love to return to take the hike to Inspiration Point. Or the boat ride. So glad we did get to experience it even briefly."

74,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Albuquerque, NM ",So beautiful,"One of the most beautiful places in the area by far.  Plenty of photo ops!  Worth going just to walk along the path, relax, and enjoy nature.  Also, if you are lucky you might see a chipmunk (with lots of people gathered round, taking advantage of the photo op LOL)"
75,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019 , Solo, ,Good hike,"Take the ranger hike to Inspiration Point! The hike is free, but you have to pay for the boat if you want to take it across the lake. Also,you have to get a token at the ranger station in order to join the hike. Be there when it opens at 8."
76,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available, ,Majestic Teton Views,"Our family whom are avid hikers thoroughly enjoyed our Jenny Lake hike. We saw an elk, just missed seeing a moose and her calf.

77,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,Bloomington ,Great scenic boat trip!,Had a great trip across Jenny Lake. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the area and the mountains around us!
78,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Austin, TX ",Beautiful lake and Falls,This should be on your list of spots to see in Yellowstone. Take the little ferry over and do the quick hike up to the exquisite falls. The water is so cold coming off the mountain.
79,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available, ,Perfect hike right from the airport,"Right after landing at JAC, drove ~20 min to beautiful Jenny Lake! Took the boat from the east side across to the west and had a fun hike up to Inspiration Point - best to have hiking shoes/boots, but wasn't too technical. Boats leave every 10-15 min. Whole excursion was less than 90 minutes. Awesome way to start off our trip!"
80,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019,not available,"Greenback, TN ",Postcard Perfect!,"No trip to the Yellowstone/Grand Teton area is complete without a visit to Jenny Lake. Its mirror-like surface and snow-capped peaks made me think of postcards and 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzles. While there are many great vantage points from which to see and photograph Jenny Lake, we found that hiking some of the trails along the shoreline gave us some excellent views. Don't miss it!"
81,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019,not available,"Springville, UT ",One of the most amazing places in the world,The water here is so clear you can see clear to the bottom and actually see fish. It was so amazingly beautiful. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to wonder or just sit on a log and breath in the clean mountain air.
82,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019,not available,"Jackson, WY ",One of our favorite hikes,"A beautiful place to spend part of the day hiking. Well maintained trails around the lake withe an opportunity to get some elevation by hiking up to Inspiration Point, or Hidden Falls. A great place for all members of the family."
83,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Villanova, PA ",Boat across the lake,"The boat that goes across the lake provides stunning views of the mountains. It can be very busy so be prepared to wait in line or go early or later in the day. Parking lot can be a hassle and be filled, especially by hikers who may stay in the lot for days. Be patient and you will eventually find a spot despite the congestion. Hiking even part of the way around the lake can enable you to see wildlife."

86,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Copenhagen, Denmark ",Scenic lake with great hikes,"Beautiful lake with scenic views and good hiking options. We took the boat across the lake and hiked to Hidden Fall and Inspiration Point. It is possible to hike further on Cascade Canyon. The hike to Hidden Fall is moderate while the hike to Inspiration Point is more strenous. Both locations are impressive, so I recommend going if physics allow. Good walking shoes, sunscreen and water are recommended. Large visitor center and parking area. Taking the boat across the lake saves approximately 4 miles. A roundtrip on the boat is 18 USD."
87,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available, ,Beautiful,This is a great stop in Grand Teton National Park. It is short walk down to the lake from the parking lot and it is a beautiful small mountain lake. You can take a hiking trail around the lake or you can take boat ride across and hike back or ride the boat both way. It is also nice just to sit and look.
88,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Troy, MI ",Blue water attraction,"Striking blue color among the evergreens. Stick your foot in—it’s cold. Lotsa hikers everywhere, and plenty of room to just sit and enjoy."

92,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019 , Friends,"Milwaukee, WI ",A fantastic hike.,"The hike was absolutely wonderful, but be sure to carry your bear spray. We were warned of a mama bear and her two cubs on the trail we were hiking, and we saw a moose with her calf too! Wonderful views, moderately challenging terrain, and an excellent boat ride back to the visitor’s center."

94,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Amazing,Take the boat over and climb Inspiration Point; the view is incredible. I was surprised to see people in flip flops attempting to hike to the top. The ground can be rocky and steep. There are spots where you should safely only have one or two people hike by each other. It was awesome.
95,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available, ,Jenny Lake,Worth the trip. Definitely hike to the hidden waterfalls and inspiration point. Get there early as the lines get long fast!
96,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Bellaire, TX ",Beautiful spot. High Traffic Parking.,"Fabulous place to spend the day, but allow twenty minutes to find parking. I was shocked at the amount of cars and the fact that we had to park on the street leading up to it. Once you are in the park it is so massive that you don't feel the crowds."
97,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Harrison, AR ",Climb to Inspiration Point and Hidden Falls,"Jenny lake is beautiful on its own, but across the lake from the boat dock is two trails you must do. Of course, if you would like you can hike all the way around the lake rather than spend the fee to be shuttled across - but who doesn't love a boat ride on a hot day. The hike up to Hidden Falls is not hard and with good shoes and WATER, even young/old can do this. Once you get to the falls area, stop and enjoy the cool breeze from the cold water and the shade. There is room for a picnic if you carry food. Just remember to pack out whatever you pack in. From the falls, you can opt to go higher or return to the boat dock. Higher takes you to the Inspiration Point at 7200 ft, and just past this the mouth of the canyon. The hike on up to the point does get narrow and steep but it is doable for most everyone."
98,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Watsonville, CA ",Many many people,"Great place for kids & families but if it’s user you want, forget it. Loud radios & hard to find parking but when they all clear away in the evening-it’s an incredibly beautiful & peaceful place"
99,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Friends,"Salisbury, MD ",Crystal Clear,The reflection on the lake is breathtaking. Hike around the lake to the Falls and take the boat back. Easy hike.

101,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Friends, ,Beautiful,"worth the stop, great place to take pictures. The history behind the name and the lake is very interesting"
102,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Amazing!,"Moderate hike, but a must for first time visitors to the park! Take the boat trip across the lake and see the beautiful falls on the other side."
103,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,The Netherlands ,Beautiful place to visit in the Teton National Park,"Most probably the number one thing to visit if you are in the Teton National Park! Try to arrive as early as fast to avoid the crowds and waiting lines.    The boat is a little expensive, we paid $50.00 for a return for a family of 4, but it save you about 2 hours and perhaps a nice hike.    The hikes are well directed and can be done if you have a normal condition, but make sure you wear walking shoes to make it more comfortable.    The views and animals are great!"
104,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Solo, ,Just like Nature intented.,"Mother Nature at her best. It is one of the prettiest lakes you can imagine. Beautiful crystal clear waters, that you can actually drink from. Fish galore, and animals at the waters edge, coming to sip their thirst away. Why would you not want to just spend a week on these gorgeous shores. I would."
105,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019,not available,"Potomac, MD ",Breathtaking!,One of the most beautiful locations in Teton National Park. You can hike the whole circumference or take a shuttle boat back and forth across the lake. It's an easy hike to Hidden Falls even for an elderly person with mobility issues.
106,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Southington, CT ",Breathtaking,"My family and I spent a day exploring the Tetons. We took the boat ride to the other side of Jenny Lake and hiked up to Inspiration point. The lake is gorgeous and peaceful. The boat ride across the lake is very short, and the line is organized and moves rather quickly. The trail, although quite busy, is absolutely amazing and the hike up to Inspiration point can't be missed. It is steep in areas,( especially the toward the top) and the elevation is high, but people of all ages were hiking and the view is worth it. Water jugs were on the dock so we were able to refill our water bottles after our hike."
107,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fayetteville, AR ",Great hiking trails and perfect for kids,Did a day of hiking up the canyon trail to Solitude lake and the kids (10 and 14) loves it with no complaints. We used the ferry to shuttle across this day. Two days later we hiked the 7.5 mile hike around the lake...kids loved it too. One of the overall cleanest places I have been. Everything was ver enjoyable and was one of the highlights of our trip.
108,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"League City, TX ",beautiful lake,we spent a morning taking a ferry to the other side of Jenny Lake. we hiked up to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. We didn't have enough time to go further but I highly recommend the part we did do. The trail was a little incline but easily managed by all. There were big boulders and rocks along the path and kids were loving rock climbing along the way. The waterfall itself was beautiful and the views were peaceful!
109,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019,not available,"Farmington, MN ",A Grand Teton Highliight!,"We got there early, because there was an event with limited parking available, but I could see even if there is not an event, people might end up in the road? We did have an encounter with a Grizzly and her cubs, so be aware! It was crazy! We assume as the day goes on and it gets busier, the bears stay away from the trails? We took the boat shuttle and hiked to hidden falls and inspiration point! Both are so worth the trek! This is beautiful park!"
110,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fayetteville, AR ",Awesome views and hikes,"Party of 8, 4 adults and 4 kids aged 10-14. The first day we rode the ferry over, hiked to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point (this will be your steepest climb but we saw all ages doing this). We continued on up Cascade Canyon and so glad we did this. We didn't quite make it to the junction (very close) and it was mostly flat walking. The kids and adults loved this! We were in between the Teton Mountains with cascades all around and some beautiful open water spaces that was just spectacular! We saw a moose grazing also. It was just awesome! We went back 3 days later to walk the perimeter of Jenny Lake which we did in exactly 2.5 hours, it's a 7.5 mile hike( sign says it takes 4-5 hours). We noticed after both days that if you get there before 10 am you beat the crowds for parking, if you wait until 11 am you will have to park on the highway which is 1/4 of a mile away, crazy. Bring water and snacks if you plan to do Cascade Canyon or perimeter hike. The worst of the perimeter hike was from the Ferry back to the boat dock on the shorter hike side (straight up for half of the hike, yikes, I'm so sore the day after).  Google for a 4th grader pass for national parks to get in free and save $70 for a 7 day pass of any national park, including Grand Tetons and Yellowstone! We had 2 4th grade boys on our trip and I was shocked how much they loved all of the sights and activities without any complaining! Best vacation ever!"
111,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fort Wayne, IN ",Good place to canoe or kayak.,"We took our family of 5 here and rented 2 canoes, one with the 3 kids and one with mom and dad. Prices were very reasonable and you can't beat the views. We stayed in Teton Village so it was only a short drive away. We had a good time."
112,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Amazing scenery,Excellent trail along the lake that takes you to Hidden Fall and Inspirational Point. Well worth the effort.
113,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",Go Early for a More Peaceful Experience,"We came here on June 20. After reading reviews we arrived at 8:15 am and there was plenty of parking. We had 18 people total, with ages from 7-72. It was very cold outside! We decided to take the shuttle both ways, since we knew the youngest and oldest ones of the group would do better with less miles total. We were glad we did the shuttle.    We went right to the boat and bought tickets for everyone. No line for the ferry so we were able to board right away. It was a nice peaceful ride across Jenny Lake, but very cold. The kids had hats, gloves, and outside layers of winter coats. We hiked to hidden falls, and it was quite amazing and one of the biggest waterfalls we’ve ever seen. There was a cold mist coming off of it. We took lots of pictures here and then proceeded to hike toward inspiration point. It was another bonus of getting there early, that for part of the time we were the only ones there, which with a group of four families all wanting their pictures taken was good for us.    My parents (the 70-year olds of the group) struggled a bit with the hike up to inspiration point. As long as we stopped often for them to catch their breath, they were fine. Inspiration point overlooked Jenny Lake and was breathtaking. Great views of the mountains and the lake. Well worth the hike.    We hiked a short part of cascade canyon trail and we got to a big section that had water flowing through (shallow) and some were worried about what looked like rain clouds in the distance. We decided to turn around and go back. The trail was definitely more busy on our way back down. It was well worth the early morning to have a more peaceful time here.    According to our apple watch we hiked about 2.5 miles. We got on the first boat ride back. We sat up front, which was a good decision. It was still pretty cold outside, and the people in the back of the boat got pretty wet. It was drizzling, but they also got wet from the splash from the lake.    One family in our group decided to take the horse trail back instead of the boat and it was more challenging than they bargained for. Apparently, the regular trail was closed, and they could only use the horse trail.    We went to the gift shops for a bit and then ate lunch in the car in the parking lot. From time we left the first boat until the time we got back to the boat dock it was about 3 hours (8:40 – 11:40am). It was MUCH more crowded when we left than when we got there. People were waiting for parking spots."
114,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"The Woodlands, TX ",Highlight of Grand Teton,"This was the highlight of our trip!! We read the reviews here and recommend going early during peak season. Took our parents aged 70 and elementary aged kids by the boat. No line if you go when they open. Was a great hike for the family. The waterfall was picturesque. Inspiration point was amazing. There were a few spots that were narrow ledges, but everyone took there time and it was fine. I think we loved it more than Yellowstone! By the time we got back around 10 am the line was more than an hour wait! Stopped by the gift shop for some great souvenirs. Definitely recommend!"
115,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family, ,BEAUTIFUL,"This is a definite!! The hike, the views and the beautiful Hidden Falls and Lake. Also, you can hike the String Lake trail the following day as well."
116,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Loveland, CO, ",Great hiking place,Jenny lake is a highlight at Grand Teton National park. There is a visitor center and convenience store there. Many tourist spend their time there hiking to see hidden falls. You can walk 3 miles from the visitor center or take the ferry service to cut downtime walking. There are many water recreational activities on the lake.
117,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Sugar Land, TX ",Boat ride and trek is worth it!,"Got to see Moose as we were hiking to Water Falls after the boat ride, Jenny Lake is picturesque and 3 mile easy trek to visitor center! Jenny Lake is the highlight of Grand Teton, should not miss!"
118,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Johnstown, CO ",Lots of hiking trails,"This place has many hiking trails, boat rides, fishing etc.. too many choices and can be packed with lots of tourists. Nice place."
119,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Family,"Abilene, Texas, United States ",Gorgeous place.,"We hiked around the lake from the starting point to the shuttle location on the other side(about 4.5 miles). Our group of 21 consisted of ages 18 months (in a back carrier pack) up to 79 years old. It was a doable hike for all those that went. It was beautiful with some amazing picture spots along the way. Not everyone chose to go up to Hidden Falls (about 1 mile) as that area was very crowded and a bit more steep. Those of us who did, found the falls to be really pretty and worth the hike. We took the shuttle ferry to return to the starting point. The ferry was perfect as one of our family members had a broken foot and could not participate in the hike but she was able to still join us on the other side of the lake so she didn't feel completely left out."
120,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Family,"Middleton, WI ","If you can go only one place in Grand Tetons, go here","This is what most people think of when they think of the Grand Tetons. And while this lake is not as often a mirror of the Teton Mountains above like in the pictures, it's still very beautiful. A shuttle boat runs across the lake frequently for about $10 per person. There is also an hour-long scenic boat tour. Our family took the shuttle boat to the Hidden Falls trail head and hiked as far as the falls which was an easy hike. So many wildflowers! We wanted to do the scenic boat tour as well but simply ran out of time.  Parking lot gets full after 10 AM so arrive early or plan on having to park far away."
121,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Mount Laurel, NJ ",Perfect setting,Take a hike. Get a boat. Whatever you need to see this beautiful lake. Visited 11 years ago and just went back last week. I wasn’t disappointed the second time around. It’s so serene and picture perfect. Make it a must see.

125,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Family,"Des Moines, IA ",Take the 1-Way Jenny Lake Road For Great Views,"Absolutely beautiful. From Teton Park Road make sure you take the 1-way Jenny Lake Road and you get right up next to the lake with spots to stop and take pictures, hike around, picnic, etc."
126,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Farnborough, UK ",A thing of beauty and grandeur!,"Get here reasonably early as it can get extremely busy. There is a gift shop that also sells food (sandwiches etc) and a ranger station. You can hike around the Lake or take a ferry to the other side, we took the ferry! From the other side of the lake you can hike to Inspiration Point and to Hidden Falls. Hidden Falls is spectacular, particularly early in the season as this is created purely by snowmelt and it is not that long a hike to either place. They were laying new tarmac when we were there so parking was congested and lots and lots of people parked on the road and had to walk a fair distance just to get in. All in all though it is a beautiful spot, just get there early to avoid the crowds."
127,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Family,"Charlotte, NC, ",Awesome place,"The Jenny Lake trail was a really fun and easy hike for our family with small kids. The trails are some of the best I've seen with lots of areas to get down close to the water so the kids could dip their feet in. The lake itself is breathtaking, and a must do while at Teton.  Also, the parking lot here fills up quickly. If you aren't able to find a spot in the main area, head down the Lupine Meadows road just before the lake to the south, and you can take a dirt road to the boat drop area, and generally the parking is much less crowded here."
128,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Couples,"New York, New York, United States ",Best hike of our trip!,We climbed almost to the top of Cascade Canyon and despite many fellow hikers found it serene and beautiful. We even saw a moose basking in the river!

131,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ",Just beautiful with stunning Teton views.,A lovely place to visit in sunny to cloudy weather. We did the Shuttle boat ride and the hike to the Hidden Falls (Cascade Canyon road was closed at this time). All of it was worth it.
132,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2019,not available,"Richmond, IN ",Beautiful lake,One of the clearest most beautiful lakes I have ever seen. There is plenty of hiking and great views of the mountain. The shuttle across the lake gives great views on a clear day and the Tetons that surround them are stunning.
133,Jenny_Lake,May 2019 , Family,"Orlando, FL ",Amazing view,"We visited via the Jenny Lake turnout, however, we did hike on the trail for a while. From the turnout, you cannot get to the water, however, the scenery is stunning. If you wish to get down to the water, go to the Jenny Lake hiking trail parking."
134,Jenny_Lake,May 2019,not available,"Canberra, Australia ",Beautiful spot in Grand Teton National Park,When travelling through the Grand Teton National Park you really should take a small detour along the Jenny Lake road and check out. We spotted a mother and baby moose close to the scenic lookout half way along the road. The lookout also has spectacular views of Jenny Lake with the Grand Tetons in the background. Get your camera out and ready. You won't be disappointed.
135,Jenny_Lake,May 2019 , Family,"West Bend, WI ",Take the hike to Hidden Falls!,My adult children took the longer hike and loved it. My husband was rehab. a knee so we took the boat across. He hiked half way and I went all the way to the falls. Its a beautiful hike and well worth going all the way to see the falls. Being May there was still snow along the way. The deeper amounts came after about half way up. Hope to do it again in fall sometime.
136,Jenny_Lake,May 2019 , Couples,"Renton, WA ",Beautiful lake!,"It's a beautiful Lake with the Tetons as the backdrop. Towards the end of May, the wind can still be chilly even when the sun is shining.    Fortunately, we bought sandwiches from the Moose Trading Post as the Jenny Lake Store doesn't sell food except for snacks and ice cream. The restroom is great. Even with abundant parking spaces, it runs out quickly by noon.    We took an hr-long cruise along the lake, which was interesting. We went back on the boat shuttle to Cascade Canyon to try hiking to Hidden Falls, but the path, though only a mile to and fro, was rock in some places which was hard for my balance and my husband's knee. So, we returned to the original dock and walked along the shore. The views were beautiful, and you can see the boats scuttle to and fro. A great place to be, don't miss it!"
137,Jenny_Lake,Apr 2018 , Solo,"Greenwich, CT ",Like A Story Book,"Visited Grand Teton National Park solely because my neighbor told me if I was in Yellowstone and didn't, I would be missing out on an amazing experience.

140,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Solo,Illinois ,easy and worthwhile hike,"Well worth it...easy loop around the lake, minor inclines / descents. As always, bring your bear spray as there was bear activity in / around the lake in early September."
141,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2018 , Friends,"Arlington, VA ",Beautiful scenery,"We didn't go too far on the trail, but even on a short walk you can get some beautiful views and photo opportunities. Fall is a great time to go to Grand Teton and Yellowstone."
142,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Buffalo, NY ",Our Favorite Place in the Tetons,"The entire Jenny Lake area of the Tetons is just stunning. Fall was an especially beautiful time to visit, which added to the spectacular scenery. The crowds were definitely smaller when we visited in late September 2018, but you will still run into parking issues at Jenny Lake, which is the most popular place in the park. The Visitor’s Center was still under construction when we were there, but it doesn’t look like they are increasing the parking areas. That’s too bad, because it is sorely needed. Definitely heed everyone’s advice about getting there early. You’ll probably still have to stalk someone for a parking space like we did, but if you persevere, you'ill be glad you did.    The boat ride over to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point was very reasonably priced at $15 roundtrip. If you are 62, ask for the senior discount, $12, which is not posted on their sign. They provide some great commentary about the lake and the area on the way over. It’s a very nice ride with some beautiful scenery you don’t see from the shore.    The hike to the falls is relatively easy. There are lots of steps closer to the falls, but you can take your time and go at your own pace. The view of the falls and the scenery on the trail are just gorgeous. It is so peaceful and serene. Expect the shuttle boat ride round trip, the hike to the falls and parking to take at least 2 hours. You can also take a one way boat trip and hike the rest of the way back, which adds on an additional couple hours. Be sure to also stop at the Jenny Lake Overlook pullout for some fantastic pics.    You can boat, canoe, hike, bicycle and camp here. It’s no wonder this is the busiest area in the park. We highly recommend you take the shuttle boat ride and do the short hike. Trust us, you won’t be disappointed!"
143,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2018 , Friends,"Madisonville, LA ",Vacation,Beautiful clear water with the Tetons reflections on the lake. Majestic and awesome. A must visit to hike around the lake.
144,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2018 , Family, ,Great Choice for Dad / Daughter Hike,"October 5, 2018: Nice time of year to hike Jenny Lake. Skies were partly sunny and temperatures were in the 50's. There were other hikers but I'm assuming it was not as busy as the peak summer season. My daughter and I hiked from the visitor center up to inspiration point and back around the south side of the lake. I'm guessing it was close to 5 miles round trip. Some uphill but very manageable. Spectacular views of the lake and valley from above. Bring your bear spray to be safe! Very nice family hike."
145,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Family,"McDonough, GA ",Wonderful view!,The 1 hour boat ride on Jenny lake was awesome! Great value and very informative! Ride in the back of boat so you can take pictures!

148,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,One of the most beautiful lakes,"WE always love visiting Jenny Lake. This year I learned how Jenny Lake got its name when I was on a tour. It was named after a Native American woman who married a white man named Leigh. They had several children and then small pox came into the area. She and her children all died, but Leigh survived because he had antibodies against the disease. When he died they named Leigh Lake after him and String Lake connects them. It is very romantic!"
149,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Fall 2018 - If in a hurry wait until next time,Jenny Lake area is under construction. I’m sure it will be great once reopened.

Hoping to return this fall
151,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,Houston ,Great scenery,My wife and I took the short boat ride across the lake to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point.

152,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Rolling Hills Estates, CA ",Beautiful,"This is a must stop when visiting the Tetons. The view of the mountains and the lake are stunning. The visitors center is under construction, but the ranger trailor had wonderful staff with lots of information for our visit. Taking a boat from the Jenny Lake Vistor's Center across the lake to the Hidden Falls trail was one of the best things we did at the park. Tickets are $15 per person for adults. Do it first thing in the morning before the tourists arrive for a nice quiet hike. First boat leaves at 10am."

154,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Grand Tetons adventures,"The Park is amazing and Jenny Lake is a favorite place for visitors. Parking crowded but available. Walk short distance to lake side with spectacular Mountain View’s. We took the boat shuttle to Hidden Falls. Shuttle was priced right and runs every 20 minutes. Easy walk with slight climb to Hidden falls and inspiration point. Great views very worth the walk. We choose to walk back around the lake but you can take the shuttle boat back. Favorite walk by many visitors so trail can get crowded, but good news no bears with all the noise on the trail.    Informative visitor center with helpful and friendly rangers available.    Currently undergoing minor construction and offers only Andy Gump restrooms.    Beautiful lake with all the amenities. Highly recommend"
155,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Stockton, NJ ",You will be glad you went!,"Just follow the people walking the sidewalk to the boat dock. And take the boat ride across the lake, for a small fee. Once on the other side you would take the trails that lead gently up a hill. You'll pass beautiful foliage, and a must see Water fall. Don't miss it."
156,Jenny_Lake,May 2018 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",Great Hike,"My wife and I hiked this trail. Very easy trail. It is very overcrowded because the trail is so easy, but definitely worth it."
157,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Rochester, NY ","Hiked around Jenny Lake, Lunch at Jenny Lake Lodge",We did the 7 miles hike around the lake starting at the Boat launch area near the Jenny Lake Visitor Center parking lot. Be sure to stop at the Jenny Lake Lodge for Lunch on your way back.
158,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Nice spot but overcrowded,This is a nice lake with boating amenities. The parking was crazy mid-week in the middle of September.
159,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands ",Not sure why this is a thing,There are so many better places in the area. I would give this a pass if you're only planning on being on the shore.
160,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Friends, ,Scenic lake with the Grand Teton as a backdrop,"We took the Jenny Lake Scenic Drive. Along the way the Cathedral Group turnout was nice. The String Lake offered a good view of the Tetons and parking was available. The Jenny Lodge also provided a good and different view of the Tetons although the trees were partially obscuring the lake. By the time we arrived at the parking area at Jenny Lake, it was completely full. If you want to do some hiking at Jenny Lake, you better arrive early. Had it not been for the scenic stops along the Jenny Lake Scenic Drive, Jenny Lake would have been a bust."
161,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples, ,Beautiful!,"We did the hike around the lake to the falls and took the boat back. We enjoyed it, but the hike was a little more than we thought it would be. Be sure to take water. We also took a picnic lunch and ate it by the falls. We were very glad to have it!! The less strenuous trail is not open at this time because it is being repaired. We saw a moose at moose pond and we saw a bear between the falls and the boat!! There were a lot of cars, but it did not seem as crowded on the trail as we would have thought it would be. We only waited about 5 minutes for the boat to take us across the lake. Highly recommend seeing this beautiful place!!"
162,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Family,"Bala Cynwyd, PA ",Absolutely beautiful,Absolutely beautiful. Great hiking and a fantastic place to have a picnic on the lake. Many of the trails are wheelchair accessible
163,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Family,Virginia ,A Must See,This is one of the MUST do's on your Teton Park Vacation. Great for hikers or non-hikers alike. Many options to explore this beautiful place. Just get there early - preferably by 8:30am.
164,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,mnimudd ,Jenny Lake boat ride to the Hidden Falls trail,"Just a beautiful scene on the ride across the lake to the trail up to the falls. Many photo opportunities on the way up and down. The hike was OK they say 'easy but a bit harder than that. Were warned about bear sightings and that is what we got on the way down. The falls are beautiful, and the many river sights from the falls going down are fantastic.  The entire walk is 1.3 miles they say but longer for older individuals.)))"
165,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2018 , Family,"Eagle Mountain, UT, ",One of my favorite lakes,"I’ve been coming here for 50 years and love it. Today was the first time I’ve taken the boat ride across. Price was steep for the ride. 3 of us for $45. But I come here for the view. Clear, blue water and great view of the Tetons. Last year I came in October after 5:30, and had the place to myself, and saw a bald eagle flying over the lake."
166,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018,not available,"Leicester, UK ",Not as good as string lake,Nice place to stop but not quite as pretty or relaxed as it’s neighbour String Lake. Jenny Lake is a good place to hire a canoe for $20 per hour or $70 for the whole day or to go for a hike. The parking is fine as long as you get there before 10 you will get a space.
167,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,"San Antonio, TX ",Very scenic,"Very scenic with lots of wildlife on the trail, inspiration point has beautiful water falls and the boat ride back was good, did not see the bears, but did see several places where the bear s___ in woods and on the trail lots of Berry’s for them to eat, saw big moose with calf, also got my heart rate up, it is a little more than it looks on the map."
168,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Detroit, MI ",Scintillating!,"Sunrise or sunset, there’s never a bad time to visit Jenny Lake. Enjoy the String Lake trailhead by the north side. The scenic drive on the north side is 4 miles long and is a one way street. South side has the brilliant Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. This is where the Visitor Center is also located. A shuttle boat or scenic cruise is strongly advised."
169,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,"McKinney, TX ",Beautiful! Postcard like setting,OUr Jackson Hole Wildlife Safari guide took us to Jenny Lake. Oh my goodness - so beautiful! Don't miss this lovely area!
170,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Saint Paul, MN, ",Stunningly beautiful - has sad story attached to name,"This is a stunningly beautiful place. Very much worth visiting.    According to our guide, ""Jenny"" was an American Indian woman who married a white man and bore 6 children. But she and all the children died from smallpox - transmitted by whites.    So this place represents the best of nature and some of the worst of human behavior. I don't mean to be a downer. It's stunningly beautiful but also a reminder that we must treat eachother better."
171,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Honolulu, HI ",Great Hike at the Tetons,"We had a baby & my parents who qualify for retirement so we needed to do some hiking that was not too challenging but worthwhile. The boat across Jenny Lake and the hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point are definitely worthwhile.    First you go to the Jenny Lake Visitor Center parking lot area. There was lots of parking but I heard that it can get crazy busy at times. We went in early June and it was ok. FYI, it is a big parking lot and there was construction in there so walking from one end of the lot to the other end took us a while (like 10 mins).    We got our tickets for the boat at the dock. The ride is affordable and the boat ride short.    The hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point are totally doable if you are in a reasonably good amount of health. Both of my older parents did perfectly fine.    The hike is really pretty. Looks of boulders, streams and greenery all tucked in between tall mountains. We even got to see a marmot scurrying around which was neat. The Falls are nice and the view from Inspiration Point is great too which is a view of Jenny Lake.    Really beautiful place and worth the time (and money) to visit. To my understanding, this is one of the most popular hikes in the Tetons, but in June it did not feel crowded which was nice."
172,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Broomfield, CO ",Beautiful,Stunning! One of the prettiest lakes in Grand Teton. We took the ferry over and hiked the trails to the falls.
173,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,Arizona ,Very nice,Very nice and scenic lake. Get there early as it gets very crowded. Took a boat tour which was nice also.
174,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Bowling Green, KY ",Beautiful place in the Grand Tetons,Jenny Lake is a beautiful place to visit in the Grand Tetons. Currently the visitor's center has some construction going on which has made a lot of traffic and crazy parking. Go early to see a great view.
175,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Solo,"South Lake Tahoe, CA ",one of my favorite stops in the Tetons,there's a bit of traffic going on so try to get there early for a parking spot otherwise it gets a bit harder to find an empty parking spot...the boat tour is a good fast way to see some of the attractions available but if you have a bit more time I suggest taking a hike on one of the trails in the area...less people...quieter...and you get to see more wildlife....
176,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Family,Richmond ,Lovely,Beautiful hike and were surprised by a bear cub! My son enjoyed fly fishing while we continued our hike around the lake.
177,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Family,"Fort Myers, FL ",Celebrating 60 with three generations!,"EPIC hike today! We took the boat back from Hidden Falls and on the way down we LITERALLY ran into a young bear (grizzly, I think). Pretty awesome, although a bit to close for comfort (as you can see in the picture). Within seconds the bear wandered across the path down into the forest. Nature at its finest!"
178,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Family,"Indianapolis, IN ",Beautiful!,"The construction at the south visitor center is a bummer, but the shuttle ride across the lake makes you forget how far you had to walk due to all the cars. It's very popular. We saw deer and a black bear swimming."
179,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Family,"Simonton, TX ",Best way to get a feel for theTetons!,"If you only have a few hours, I recommend this stop! A shuttle boat (purchase ticket AT the boat dock) takes you across the lake and puts you at the trailhead for aHidden Falls and Inspiration Point. Both are short, but oh so worth it hikes! Amazing views! If you are up for something more strenuous, look at Cascade Canyon. The first mile is a horse trail and you gain over 500 feet in elevation. After that, views and wildlife are great! The Visitors Center has the greatest people to answer any questions!"
180,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Valrico, FL ",Stunning!,Beautiful lake. Great place to have a picnic lunch and get away from the crowds. The water is crystal clear.
181,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Midlothian, VA ",Lake that looks like a photo on a calendar,this is worth making a stop at. It is one of the most picturesque lakes I have seen. Walkways are narrow though so watch small children. There are wildlife tours that include a stop here. That makes for a great morning
182,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Family,"Bridgewater, Massachusetts, United States ",Beautiful hike,"Great hike along the lake! We were advised to get to the parking lot by 9, it fills up fast, and it was good advice. We took the ferry over to hike up to the cascades. Great family hike!"
183,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Louisville, KY, ",A Grand Teton Wonder,Another wonder of The Grand Tetons National Park. This is a very busy area of the park almost every day so plan to arrive early to get a parking spot otherwise you will be disappointed. If you get a spot early you will be rewarded with a wonderful day.
184,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Business,"St. Petersburg, FL ",Beautiful,"If you want to see beauty, take a Jenny Lake boat tour and stop at Inspiration Point and Hidden Falls. The view from the lake of the grand tetons, the amazing waterfall and rush of the rapids and the wildlife that you encounter is worth the trip"
185,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Ocean City, MD ",Jenny Lake Road a BIG dissapointment,We loved the view of the Tetons across Jenny lake but were very disappointed in the views from Jenny Lake Road. Bottom line the only place to get a view of the lake or the Tetons is from the overlooks... the view from the car windows as you drive along is simply non existent. All that can be seen from the car is the trees as you pass them. I guess we just expected too much.    Overlooks were crowded and parking at a premium.
186,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Tucson, AZ ",Beautiful lake trail,"We went the whole way around the lake, plus moose pond, beautiful all the way around. Saw a black bear across the creek and a female moose and her baby at moose pond!"
187,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Solo,"Utopia, TX ",Another fun day trip,Rode the ferry across the lake. Enjoyed the beautiful views. Great experience for the whole family! Attentive ferry captain.
188,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Arab, AL ",Go early,"Arrived a few minutes after 8 am and no crowds at all. We got there to get a token for the 8:30 ranger program and hike to Hidden Falls. Loved the boat ride over and the hike. The only problem was stopping in the middle of the trail to hear the ranger and not being able to hear. Even if you don't do the Ranger program, go! We just hiked Hidden falls and Lower inspiration point. Beautiful and plenty of walking for my 12 and 13 year old."
189,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Haslett, MI ","Gorgeous hike, saw bears","Our family group of 7 hiked counter clockwise around the lake and then took the boat back to the visitor center. Within 5 minutes of our hike, we saw a small black bear. Fortunately, it wandered off into the brush once it saw us and we didn’t need to deploy our spray. Approximately an hour into the hike, we saw another medium size bear sauntering along the trail. It also moved off into the brush when it saw us. The hike was not as easy as advertised (it is not “completely flat” as the ranger told us), but it was not terribly difficult — only slight elevation gains. The views are spectacular and the trail was not crowded once you get away from the parking areas and visitor center."
190,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,Stamford ,Beautiful spot and fun boat ride,We visited and had no trouble with parking when we got there at 9am. The attendant gave us the family rate even though our oldest was 20. The trail was crowded at first and then thinned out. A few people were feeding chipmunks at Inspiration Point- not good! I'm sorry to hear that this area just closed because of a fissure. It really was spectacular.
191,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family, ,Worth it!,"We visited Jenny Lake in early July and the lake was crystal clear and the weather was fantastic. My family (including a 7 and 4 year old)hung out by the lake for a bit and then decided to take the short boat ride across the lake to hike. We were very glad we took the boat as it saved our energy for the hike. We were exhausted after the hike, which took us (non hikers) about four hours up/down. Totally worth it!"
192,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Rochester NY, United States ",Perhaps the best spot in the Tetons,"Get there early for a parking spot, but even if you have to walk from the road..just do it! Options for distance walks around the lake with incredible views all along the way. Just be sure to have bear spray."
193,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Friends,"Birmingham, MI ",Amazing hiking,"Get here early - we arrived when they opened at 8. At the time plenty of parking and very few on the trail. The “easy” trail still had many areas of rock and inclines but beautiful scenery. Take water and visit the Porto potties because ther are none on your walk. We walked half the loop and took the boat back. When we were leaving around 11 the place was packed - parking lots full and on to the road in, lines to get on the boat. Get there early and avoid the rush."
194,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Wynnewood, PA ",Gorgeous!,"Whether you're hiking to the Hidden Falls or Cascade Canyon, you'll pass through Jenny Lake. Walk around the lake for a shorter hike to Hidden Falls then either hike back or take the boat. If hiking Cascade Canyon, I recommend taking the boat both ways and saving your energy for the long hike. Ask for the family discount which is $45 round trip! Or just go and hang out at the lake and take in the gorgeous scenery."
195,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Nijmegen, The Netherlands ",Iconic and picturesque,"Jenny Lake is the first and most iconic vista in the Grand Teton NP. There is a short scenic route, which is not scenic but where you can stop mid way to a scenic point. Beautiful ! I wish we had had more time to be able to do the hike."
196,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Friends,"Franklin, PA ",Beautiful!,We rode the ferry over and hiked to Hidden Falls and Lower Inspiration Point. We had to hike further than expected because one of the trails was closed. Both were worth the moderate climb. Always check the trails you are planning to hike and make sure they are open before you head out.
197,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Mission Viejo, CA ",A must see!,We took a boat ride across the lake to do a little hike. There is a waterfall at the end of one of the hikes. You can also take a scenic boat ride as well. I recommend getting there early before 9:30 am for parking. It's about $12 RT for a ride.
198,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Couples, ,Beautiful lake,"This is a must see if you are in the area! Jenny lake is absolutely breath taking with the grand Tetons right in sight. You can take boat tours across the lake, bike around the lake. And so much more. There are a lot of look out points and lots to explore!"
199,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Huntsville, AL ",Make picture postcard shots with ease!,"Just drive up and park. Walk a few feet and make picture perfect photos to take home memories. This can take all of 5 minutes at times, or much longer at prime times of the day, as Jenny Lake is very popular. Worth your time!"
200,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Madisonville, TX ",BEAUTIFUL,"We saw a bear just before we stopped at Jenny Lake, but the view was AWESOME! Very pleasant drive. I loved the rock walls as well."
201,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Pittsburgh, PA, ",It’s a must do in the Tetons,"Hike around it, swim in it (water is cold), boat or just kick back and soak it in. The only problem is parking if you go go early or late and enjoy the views. Soak in the beautiful scenery"
202,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Hartsville, SC ",Jenny Lake Boat Tour,This is great! I really enjoyed the boat tour $19 pp. The guide/driver was knowledgeable and clearly lovely the lake. Well worth it!
203,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Fishers, IN ","Incredible Experience, could have spent more time here for sure","Despite the construction and renovations happening up front, there is so much to do here. We could have spent more time hiking for sure. We arrived mid-late morning and the parking was difficult. Later in the day it was worse. This is a very popular attraction. The gals in the visitor center were helpful before our hike. Took the boat ride across the lake and hiked to Lower Inspiration Point. That was one of our favorite hikes with the most incredible views and features. We will come back here for sure and spend more time exploring."
204,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,Ohio ,"Easy hike, perfect for families","We combined the hike and ferry for an easy but enjoyable morning at Jenny Lake. If hiking with kids, I recommend hiking around the lake to Hidden Falls first, then taking the boat back as it gives them a reward at the end of the hike. It's an easy hike with a fabulous view, well maintained trail and plenty of people to add a sense of security."
205,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Couples,"West Bloomfield Township, Michigan, United States ",Great Hike with Beautiful Views!,"My husband and I hiked Jenny Lake last week. It was a busy time of the year so we were told to go early otherwise parking is bad. Everyone was right about that. We got there early, it was less crowded and cooler. We hiked around to the Falls and then took the Ferry back. The hike was moderate in difficulty with amazing views. If you go during bust time, go early. Cars were parked on the side of the road by the time we left!"
206,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Melbourne, Australia ",Breathtaking lake.,This place a must see with absolute beauty if the lake and mountains to the real. Take the boat ride across the lake to the other side to the various trails and fabulous water falls. All very well laid out path ways and around the main visitor centre path ways leading to lake are all very well maintained. Well worth a trip and although crowds at this time of the year (summer) once at the lake you are able to get around. Just hard to get parking and need to park on side of road and walk inn to the lake.
207,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2018 , Friends,"Metairie, LA ",Beautiful,"Jenny Lake is still one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Very crowded for the weekend prior July 4th, but was worth the wait. I have hiked to Hidden Falls but would wait til the crowds thinned out and highly recommend it. Amazing ~"
208,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Waycross, GA ",Yesss!!!,"This was the higlight of our trip! We loved the ride around the Lake, stopping to hike and take pictures, It must be the most restful and beautiful place ever!!"
209,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Boston, MA ",Gorgeous,"Took the boat across the lake with 3 young kids. Hidden Falls is magnificent, Inspiration Point trail was partially closed and under construction, but we had a wonderful hike. The scenery is second to none. Great trail, although a bit more crowded than I would like, but that doesn't take much. HIGHLY recommended."
210,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples, ,A must visit,"Jenny Lake is BEAUTIFUL. The boat transfer to the other side is great. Round trip is $15/adult. The boats do round trips every 15 minutes. Once over to the other side, the hike is easy to hidden falls and inspiration point. Inspiration point is modified for 2018 but still nice. The falls were breath taking-the best you will see in less than a .5 mile walk on easy trails (steps involved). Asked a few questions of the park staff while we were there and found them eager to answer questions. One tip- go early in the morning as by 9 the parking lot is full."
211,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,Mississippi Gulf Coast ,Absolutely beautiful!,If traveling thru Teton National Park ... make it a point to drive or hike around Jenny lake .... very picturesque!!! You will be glad you took the time to see it! There is also a hiking trail that goes around the entire lake if you have extra time.
212,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Kissimmee, FL ",Water like glass,"Beautiful place. We walked the short paved trail by the dam, it had great views. (It starts up beside the restrooms). Worth a stop."
213,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Scottsdale, AZ ",Nice boat trip,It takes very little time to take boat across the lake for some hiking. You can choose 1.2 mile round trip hike up to see the falls (it was crowded for viewing) or elect to hike back which is about 2.5 miles. Boat ride is less than 10 minutes each way and not long wait. Biggest issue here is parking.
214,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Caledonia, MS ","BEAUTIFUL, Relaxing boat ride",We took the boat across the lake and it was a relaxing ride with a beautiful hike at the end! I would highly recommend this! And the ice cream at the end of the boat ride was great!
215,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Hershey, Pennsylvania ",Scenic and beautiful,Located in Grand Tetons NP. Great hiking trainls around the lake. The trail to inspiration point was still undergoing construction and was closed. We did see Hidden Falls and Mini inspiration point. Get there early as it does get very crowded. The ferry across the lake runs frequently starting at 7.00 am and shaves a good distance off the hike to hidden falls. Pace yourself as this is at an elevation of over 7000 feet. There is also great opportunity for wildlife viewing so bring binoculars.
216,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Business,"Jackson, WY, ",Please arrive early,"I include two different photos: the reflection photo is if you leave Jackson around 5:30-6:30 a.m. and go to north Jenny Lake Junction to the Jenny Lake Overlook.  The second photo is if you leave town ~12:00 and go to South Jenny, famous for the boat across the lake for hiking to a Hidden Falls or for a cruise. I hope you can see all the cars in the distance along the access road. Please don’t get me wrong; Jenny Lake is worth 5 stars easily. But it has become so very popular, there are so many, many more people who want to see it than there are places to park. The access road was overparked on both sides by 11:00. today. By 2:00 p.m. cars lined the main Teton Park Rd at least 2 km out from visitor center, probably more, and it’s not even July yet.  Please, to have a positive experience, come early.  Word to the wise, the first boat across the lake for climbers and any who wish, for Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point,leaves At 7:00 a.m. with the next one at 8:00."
217,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Oklahoma City, United States ",A Must Do!,"This is a must Do! The boat ride across Jenny Lake is unreal, The view of the mountains is unbelievable and the view of hidden falls is unbelievable."
218,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Columbus, OH ",Picturesque,So many beautiful views. Bring plenty of memory cards and batteries. The boat ride to and from Hidden Falls was relaxing.

220,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Lafayette, LA ",Beautiful views,"We took the ferry across, then hiked to Hidden Falls for a beautiful view, then a somewhat challenging hike in the rain back around to the trailhead."
221,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Clinton, TN ","Beautiful views, harder than you think hikes","We started out to hike around the lake, and took a side route to Moose pond, where we did indeed see a moose! Then we started upwards, and it was much more difficult than we thought. But the view of the lake was worth it! We saw a beautiful waterfall and rushing streams. We made it two-thirds around the lake, but had to turn back to catch the ferry, in order to meet our ride back to Jackson Lodge. The scenery is breath-taking!"
222,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Hamilton, OH ",Hidden Falls,We took the boat across Jenny Lake and hiked up to Hidden Falls. The hike was more strenuous than I was given to believe but it was well worth it. The falls are spectacular!
223,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Gilbert, AZ ",Jenny Lake shuttle,Was happy to discover that veterans are free for the boat shuttle. Also the waterfall at the end of the trail on the other side was simply breathtaking!!
224,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Rapid City, MI ",Amazing,"We hiked the horse trail around the lake which was mostly uphill and a little scary for a short stretch. The kids loved it, especially sighting a moose near the trail. This was the only moose we saw on our trip so it was special. The view of the falls was beautiful. We relaxed and cooled off on the return boat ride."
225,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Favorite place in the states,The hike around Jenny lake is gorgeous. Highly recommended family activity once your kids can do 6-7 miles.
226,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Greenville, SC ",Stunning!,Our time at Jenny Lake was perfect! We went early in the morning and were treated to an amazing view of the Teton's reflection in the lake. Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point were beautiful. Saw two moose at Moose Pond on the hike back around the lake. We met some wonderful people at the falls who we look forward to keeping in touch with.
227,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Mansfield, OH ",Idyllic Setting,"We went to Jenny Lake on our last day in Jackson Hole. It's much smaller than big brother Jackson Lake, but my wife and I loved it. The lake is deep and the water is Crystal clear. You can see many fish in it. We did the gorgeous hidden falls hike. It's challenging in spots but we'll worth it. Get there early as the parking does fill up fast."
228,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Missouri City, TX, ",Beautiful lake,This is a beautiful lake that is up to 400 feet deep with clear water. It is surrounded by stunning mountains and is a must see if you visit the park.

231,Jenny_Lake,May 2018 , Couples,"Lake Wales, FL ",Lake Jackson's little sister,With the Grand Teton mountains as a backdrop its hard to find a more beautiful setting. We were fortunate to see this sight on a crystal clear day. The mountains in the background are magnificent and almost other worldly.
232,Jenny_Lake,May 2018 , Couples,"Gilbert, AZ ",Jenny Lake Overlook,We did the hike into Hidden Falls that was amazing. Then went to Jenny Lake North entrance and did the little drive out and stopped at the lookout. The first day was very cloudy and we couldn't see tops of the peaks a lot but later in the day the lighting was awesome and we got some cool shots. The next day went hiking on Spring Lake towards Jenny Lake trail. Amazing as the weather was sunny and totally different look from the Outlook. Highly recommend that trail for beautiful hike facing the peaks almost the whole time. We only went in about a mile due to time but well worth it.
233,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Business,"Erie, PA ","Beautiful, even in the rain..","There is a boat trip across Jenny lake to hiking trails in the foothills of the Tetons. There are some well-worn hikes on narrow trails leading to beautiful vistas of waterfalls or back toward the east across Jenny lake. Fees include return trip from the waiting area, which is first come first served. It started to rain so the boat service folks increased frequency of trips"
234,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2017 , Family,"Wyoming, ",So Many Things to Do,"This lake is very popular although it is among the smaller lakes of the park. They have a wonderful marina there that offer rentals, boat rides to the trail heads, and scenic trails all around the area. One of our favorite things to do in Jenny Lake is to boat/kayak/canoe and hike. It is great for all ages and can last all day long. Be mindful of parking, as first thing in the morning is always best if you want to take on a trail or get out onto the water to beat the heat."

236,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ",WOW,WOW! one of the most beautiful views I have ever seen. During my entire Road Trip from PA to CA this was my favorite view. Definitely touristy but none the least GORGEOUS! Would definitely return to camp there as well.
237,Jenny_Lake,Jan 2018,not available,"Newport, RI ",Winter wonderland,"Visited January 15, 2018. Snowshoed from Taggart Lake Trailhead. Tetons appeared out of the fog/mist as we hiked. Spectacular. Lake was mostly iced over and snow covered but beautiful with ice covered trees, snow covered trails and Tetons looming above."
238,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2017 , Friends,"Surf City, NC, ","12,000 Year Old Glacier Lake","I am so accustomed to all the glacier lakes in New York & in the Northeast & was surprised to see this beautiful Glacier Lake in the Tetons. We were able to get off our tour bus for short walk along the shoreline. It was very chilly and windy on this late September day and the whitecaps on the Lake were reminders of some of the smaller waves back at our Beach House in North Carolina. You could not see the clarity of the water because of the waves, but from the road up on the top of a mountain,looking down on the lake, you could see how clear it is."
239,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2017 , Solo,"Grand Junction, CO ",Gorgeous.,A stunning local and well worth the visit if nothing more than to take in all the beautiful surroundings.
240,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Sevenoaks, UK, ",Beautiful Lake,"This is a wonderfully attractive lake, framed by the Teton mountains. There are many turnouts from the road from which you can get to the lakeshore and take in the views. I believe you can also take a boat trip out onto the lake. Stunning and so peaceful."
241,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"North Carolina Mountains, NC ",Visitor Center still open but under construction,"The Jenny Lake VC is under reconstruction so it only has a gift shop and information counter in a trailer - but there’s a nearby gift shop and convenience store run by a concessionaire. One of the curious things about multiple visitor centers (or even concessionaire gift shops) inside one national park - they often sell different things. We like to collect embroidered patches from each NPS unit we visit and make sure to go to each gift shop and visitor's center to find the ones we like best. Ditto books, ornaments, etc. Don't miss Jenny Lake just because it's temporary and small. But the parking is tight because of construction. The earlier you arrive the better, but you can still find a spot if you cruise around."

We did not partake of any lake activities other than viewing and enjoying the scenery around the lake."
244,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Pahrump, NV, ",Beautiful lake,This is a beautiful lake with views of the Tetons . Parking is definitely limited here so plan to go early. You can do a nice hike here as well as stopping at the overlook. The 7 mile Jenny Lake Loop is very pretty. It is a must see place in Grand Teton National Park. It is a popular spot to stop at or to hike.
245,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Pleasant Hill, CA ",Hike around Jenny Lake,We started our hike around Jenny Lake to the North with some great views of the Teton's and then around the river that flows into the lake when the leaves were changing. Make sure to go up to the hidden falls.
246,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Westbrook, ME ",Beautiful,At the base of the Grand Tetons you will find Jenny Lake. Parking is difficult here now as the area is under construction but it is well worth the extra walk you may need to take to see the lake.

247,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Prescott Valley, AZ ",Beautiful Lake at foot of Grand Tetons,"This is one of the most popular places in Grand Teton National Park. Parking was scarce and the Park was very busy the weekend before the Total Eclipse. The stop was definitely worth the traffic and walk from our parking spot. I wish we had time to take the ferry across the lake or hike around the lake. We will definitely do that on our next visit. Unfortunately, if was a bit hazy during our visit due to fires in Montana."
248,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Hamilton, OH ",Incredible little lake,"The views of the Tetons around this lake are incredible. We took the boat ride across to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. We wish we had not gotten the round trip ticket and walked the 2.5 mile trail back, but we did not realize that the walk back was so short. Maybe next time. Going in September made a difference with the crowds. Only a few people waiting for the boat and walking the trails."
249,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Greenville, SC ",This is a MUST do!,"Wear comfortable shoes and take the boat shuttle across Jenny Lake. The views are amazing and the hikes are doable for anyone. This was our best day while visiting Jackson, Yellowstone and the Tetons."

252,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Palm Springs, CA ",Boat shuttle across lake to trail head for hike,Hiked Cascade canyon and Inspiration Point. Took the boat shuttle across the lake to the trailhead. Trail was crowed with lots of people hiking. Great Views. Saw a Moose.
253,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ",Jenny lake is beautiful; walk is crowded.,Went to Jenny lake to hike the loop of the lake. A part of the trail is near the road and the 7 mile loop is mostly a walk w only a few sections w elevation. Lake is absolutely beautiful however there were a lot of people near the shuttle dock and hidden falls that were loud and disrespectful of the surroundings. This is not a quiet peaceful hike if that is what you are looking for.
254,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Gaithersburg, MD ","Perfect Mountain Lake, and a Trail to Natural Wonder","During my visit to Jackson Hole, my wife and I took a relaxing boat ride from the ranger station to a trailhead across the lake. The mountain views from the lake were stunning. At the trailhead, we hiked through the woods about 0.6 miles to Hidden Falls, an unexpected cascade pouring down from higher elevations on Mt. Owen. We could have hiked further to Inspiration Point, but that trek was as likely to take my breath away as the view from there."

Of course, we also used it for a shortcut to the trail head 35 years ago and appreciated it then also. If you wanted to see the most people in the closest space then the parking area and highway and Visitor Center were the place to be for the 3 days of eclipse mania."
259,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017,not available,"Annapolis, MD ","Beautiful, peaceful","We took the boat across the lake and hiked around the lake back. Get there early as there were way too many people as we were returning. The waterfall was worth the hike and there is a reason they named ""Inspiration Point"" what they did."
260,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Friends,"San Francisco, CA ",As beautiful as promised,"There's a reason this hike is so popular and highly rated on every must-do list for the area... it is absolutely gorgeous! We did the Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point hikes, and, as recommended, we caught the boat across the lake shortly after 8am, while the parking lot wasn't full yet and the traffic along the trails was very light for the first couple of hours. We were so glad to avoid the crowds that were becoming apparent around noon. It took us a bit longer than we expected because the connecting trail between Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point was closed for construction (I imagine the very wet spring melt was the culprit at washing out some of the trail that was being rerouted and shored up). Because of this, we had to backtrack after the Falls back past the boat launch and take the long way up to the Point. The lower lakeside trail was also closed, which we had hoped to take to Moose Ponds, so we took the boat back again. There were more trails, and we'd heard that the Canyon is especially lovely, but we decided not to join the parade of people that was steadily increasing. I definitely recommend that you catch this location early (the boat starts running at 7am) to get the most out of this hike."
261,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,New York ,Worth Seeing,"Loved Jenny Lake, but the construction was a bit distracting. Considering that the eclipse traffic would be record setting, the place should have been completed by then."
262,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Santa Clarita, CA ",Jenny Lake Boat Trip,"Highly recommend this boat trip. Great way to get a close view of Tetons would have liked to hike as well, but we did not have time."
263,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Surprise, AZ ",Beautiful Hidden Falls!,Get there before 9am or after 2 because of the crowds and construction going on! We took the Boat across the lake and hiked up to the Hidden Falls! It was well work it! Lots of places on your way up to stop and take cool pictures!
264,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Babb, MT ",Bike to Jenny Lake from Moose Junction,"My friend and I went to Moose Junction Visitor center first; nice center, not as big as many of the other park centers.  We went over to Dornans so my friend could rent a bike (I had brought my own) We biked 8miles North from Dornan's in Moose to Jenny Lake. It was a beautiful bike ride, one of the best I have ever done. Amazing views. Beautiful. We stopped a lot to take pics. There is one major hill up, initially; if you prefer to skip it, you can also go to the Windy River(?unsure of name- it's first pullout to right at top of hill) pullout and bike to Jenny Lake from there. There are lots of pullouts along this route, you could use any of them.  There was no parking at Jenny Lake by the time we got there, good thing we biked! We then took boat ride to other side of Lake ($15 per person- one way) if you hiked around the lake, you could ride back for free. We hiked to top to see Hidden Falls. Gorgeous! We got back around 6pm; pretty hungry so we ate at Dornan's Chuckwagon- great food and amazing views of Tetons at picnic tables. We also saw a mama moose and her baby in the parking lot before we left- the name of town, doesn't disappoint!!"
265,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Milan, TN ",Great cruise on Jenny Lake,"We had 40 people to take the cruise on Jenny Lake. The scenery was awesome, the guide was extremely knowledgeable and the whole group enjoyed it..to the max!"
266,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017,not available, ,Parking lot construction,The parking area is under construction so get there early or you will be parking out on the main road! We took the ferry shuttle to the other side of the lake to do the Inspiration Point hike. The area is beautiful! I even saw a moose in the creek by the boat house!
267,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Lenexa, KS ",Beautiful Jenny Lake and Hidden Falls,"This is a popular place during the summer months which might make finding a parking space near the lake challenging, but keep trying. The lake is absolutely beautiful. Our goal was to go to the Hidden Falls. We took a short boat ride over to get to the drop-off point which is close to the trail leading up to the Falls. If you have the energy you can walk a trail around the lake which I believe they said would be 1-2 miles one way. The trail leading up to the Falls can be a bit narrow. Wear good hiking shoes and take water. for those less experienced hikers, like me, it can seem like a real uphill climb (it is :) ) but so worth it when you see the falls. They are beautiful. The trip back down is so easy...."
268,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,Nebraska ,Beautiful Lake,This lake is very large and beautiful. There is also a lot that they offer. I highly recommend taking the boat and visiting Hidden Falls.
269,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Pittsburgh, PA ","Loved Jenny Lake, absolutely beautiful and great hiking",Jenny lake is a must if you are in the Tetons. Take a Ranger walk to hidden falls and hike to inspiration point. We didn't get to but we would like to go back and hike around the lake. The boat ferry is reasonably priced and takes you right to the base of the most popular trails.
270,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017,not available,"Pensacola, FL ",Beautiful vistas and delicious lunch too!,The drive around Jenny Lake is as beautuiful as any around the Tetons....and that is saying a lot. Can't imagine anyone going to Yellowstone and missing out on these dramatic peaks everywhere. Add a water reflection and it is even more breathtaking. We had a delicious lunch at the Jenny Lake Lodge and ended it with superb homemade ice cream.
271,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Family,Kentucky ,Fun Family Day Hike,Great hiking trails. Easy trail follows the lake near the visitor center. Also found a picnic location a little further north at String Lake.
272,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Littleton, Colorado ",Beautiful drive everywhere in Grand Teton national Park,"Many visit Yellowstone and miss the Grand Tetons - their loss.  Love the grand Tetons, dive all of the roadways, especially to Jenny Lake and String Lake, if time walk around or take boat across Jenny Lake. If you have time and money stay at the Jenny Lake Lodge, one of the best resorts and restaurants in the world."
273,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Mount Laurel, NJ ",Beauty!!!,This is a must stop place. Boat ride was great with a very knowledgeable guide. Trail to the falls was amazing. Easy hike for all. We spent 2 hours could have spent the day. One of my favorite stops in GTNP and a true must see. Can't more enthusiastically recommend this stop. As a bonus we saw a moose 50 ft. From the dock.
274,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Newaygo, MI ",Boat ride & hiking to Hidden Falls,"Gorgeous falls!  Wear good shoes, bring water. They have a refill station at the boat dock.  It was very busy the day we visited and super hot. The cool mist the falls gave off felt like an air conditioner, awesome!"
275,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Sherrills Ford, NC ",Loved this Hike!,"It is a MUST to arrive before 9am unless you want park out on the highway. My recommendation is to take the quick boat shuttle over (40$ for a family, they accept debit cards, and you pay right at the dock) After your short ride over, you get off and take an easy hike to Hidden Falls and Lower Inspiration Point. (The Upper Inspiration Point Hike is closed right now.) It takes a total of 30 minutes to visit these two areas, but they have incredible views! (We even saw a black bear and her cub near the base of the falls.) Even though we purchased the boat for round trip, we wanted to do some hiking. The trail back around to the boat house is about 2.5 miles mostly downhill, but a little rocky and a few times you will need to rest. We felt accomplished that we hiked back- it was scenic with beautiful wildflowers. We met many people on their way UP the trail and they looked miserable! That is why I think taking the boat first and hiking back would work best. Oh, and bring a little backpack with water and snacks- went went through every last crumb and drop we had with us."
276,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Amazing Views but you share the hiking path with horses,"This is my review of the hiking trail at Jenny Lake. We took the 3 mile trail that runs along the eastern shore of Jenny Lake, leaving from the JL ranger station, connecting with the vehicle pull-off at the JL Overlook, and continuing north to String Lake. The views from this trail are breathtakingly amazing, and the hike itself is easy with only areas that were moderately strenuous (we hiked 3 miles to String Lake and back again, the 10-year old did just fine). The only downside to this trail is that it is shared by horses for about 2 of the 3 miles, and the manure is piled up everywhere, you can't escape it. We were constantly dodging piles of it, and as the day got hotter the stench got worse. Had I known it was a multi-use path, I would have found another hike in the park. I'm struggling with giving 5 stars, because the hike really was gorgeous except for the manure."
277,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017,not available,"Fort Lauderdale, FL ",Beautiful,We saw a bear and it's cubs are very first day. Make sure you bring your bear spray just in case!! It was really cool and a beautiful lake. I saw a bunch of people swimming in the lake and eating lunch.
278,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,Denmark ,Good long hike almost flat,"A good hike around the lake - mostly flat although you'll get your pulse up from a couple of hills. Good views of the mountains. Don't miss the hidden falls - and if you have an extra hour or two, take the inspiration point detour aswell."
279,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Thousand Oaks, California, United States ",Take the boat over to hidden falls,"Worth the round trip ticket to go across the lake to the base of the Teton Mountains. Hike up to hidden falls and feel the cold air coming off the water. Take a water bottle, and you can refill from ice coolers at both docks. If you are on the dock near sunset, be sure to have mosquito repellent available!"
280,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Greenville, SC ",Boat ride,"The boat ride across Jenny Lake and the hiking was magnificent! There is alot of wildlife, waterfalls and rivers. Definitely recommend it!"
281,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Phoenix, AZ ",Long and dusty walk around the lake but worth it,"We got to the temporary visitor center at 8:20, still had enough empty parking spaces. Don't wait much longer to show up, or you will be out on the entrance road shoulder...    The Jenny Lake store is well stocked with souvenirs, clothing and such. That cost me $150 but hey, probably once a decade at best. The temporary porta-potties worked but were being serviced, and needed it.    The ranger station/visitor center gives good info and maps about the area. Do heed the bear warnings, we almost encountered one on the first part of the longer (5 mile) portion of the trail, it was off in the bushes and didnt bother us but did scare my spouse some. Sing, jangle gear or throw rocks in the woods...    The trail runs around the lake, close to the paved road a ways, and you can park at a couple different places close to the String Lake if you want to make a shorter hike.    The trail is level and reasonably wide at times, the lake views are pretty, and the rushing river up at the String Lake end was very high and delightfully noisy. As you go around to the back side you start to climb a bit. When you are at the area where the shuttle ferry docks, expect a lot more traffic. That's the trail junction for Inspiration point (a real slog uphill) and the shorter but still streaks hike to the falls overlook.    When we were there in late July the lower trail going back to the visitor center (the shorter leg, about 2 miles) was closed, so you have to go up to the falls and take the upper trail. Almost no one did.  The very pontoon boat will get you wet with spray if you sit near the back. If the wind comes up (and it usually does after mid-day) the lake can get rough.    We started early and were done by 2 pm, good thing as there was a T storm starting right then. If you dont take 500 pictures of flowers, butterflies and other items you wont take near as long as we did.    A nice hike, it was close to 80 or higher as we were near the Inspiration Point so bring more than a liter bottle of water per person!"
282,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family, ,"Nice to see, not extraordinary","It is a very pretty lake, and nice stop in Grand Teton National Park. Get there early (before 10:00) if you want to easily find parking and don't want to walk as far.  The shuttle across the lake to the waterfall and trails was nice and fast (if you want to avoid the hike) and you can just take it one way if you decide you don't want to hike back. It was expensive though if you do want to travel both ways ($38 for a family). The hike on the other side of the lake is nice, although full of people. The river and waterfalls were beautiful.  I recommend a visit if you are able to go early, and perhaps hike one of the 2 mile trails to save on cost."
283,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Eaton, OH ",One of the prettiest places in the Tetons.,"this is one of the prettiest place in the Tetons. There is lots to do in the area. If you get a chance take a boat ride on the lake. The guides have so much information about the area and the history. Well worth the time and money. Make sure you bring a camera, because the views are so pretty. I will go again when I'm back in the area which I hope is soon."
284,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Super pretty,"Jenny Lake was pretty. In the visitor center/gift shop I bought a little book about Jenny Leigh, married to Beaver Dick Leigh, whom the book is named after. I learned so much even though it was historical fiction! Great, strong people."
285,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Friends,Utah ,Jenny Lake Hike,Have tried to hike this more than once. Finally with the crowd left in town for the parade we headed out bright and early- was lucky enough to get there and find parking and head out while it was still cool. They are working on the lower trail so you are hiking along a horse trail that is more steep. Saw a few moose and a marmot. If you don't feel like hiking the whole thing you can catch the ferry that goes across the lake. Towards the afternoon crowds are ridiculous and the trail gets crowded- almost as bad as the parking lot. There were cars lined up waiting for you to pull out so they could nab your place. There are no formal bathrooms and the outhouses they have are really used- You have been warned...lol Love the hike it's self and want to go again. I think they are doing the best they can with the crowds...
286,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Pataskala, OH ",Beautiful,We were here in the evening and got to see the beautiful sunset over the Tetons. It's a gorgeous spot. Must see. Parking is limited due to construction. Bring your bugspray.

288,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Solo,"Warragul, Australia ",Tour,We had a 2 hr stop here. Took the boat over the lake and walked back.  The flat trail by the lake is closed due to a landslide so we had to take the steeper route.  I have a severe fear of heights so I found one section of the walk a bit scary but otherwise it's an easy hike if you're reasonably fit.
289,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Modesto, CA ",Nice hike,"We took the boat across the lake and walked back along the lake walk. We didn't find the hike strenuous, steady incline made walking easy and enjoyable. The waterfall on the other side of the lake was beautiful!"
290,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Family,"Managua, Nicaragua ",Favorite place,Had a fantastic time hiking at the lake. The trek to the Hidden Falls has amazing views and you never know what you will see on the hike....saw our first moose ever...up close and personal!
291,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Family,"Burlington, NC ",Always a highlight,"One of the most beautiful places I've ever been. We visited in the evening, and again the next morning. I highly recommend taking a boat across the lake and hiking up to Hidden Falls."
292,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Pleasanton, CA ",Get Inspired at Jenny Lake's Inspiration Point!!!!,"This lake is magical as you take a short boat ride across to a trail head for Inspiration Point. The hike is short, either .8 or 1.2 miles depending on which path you take. There are beautiful waterfalls to view as you head to Inspiration Point for gorgeous views of the Grand Tetons. Must do to make a Grand Teton visit complete."
293,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Family,"Sherwood, OR ",Boat Ride Across Jenny Lake,"We took a shuttle boat from south Jenny Lake parking area to north side of Jenny Lake and went on a short hike to Inspiration Point. It was a great hike: we saw a marmot, heard Pikas, and crossed the results of a recent avalanche this past winter. So was still on the ground in this area and it made for a scenic and beautiful hike. I highly recommend it. The boat ride itself is wonderful and you can take that ride regardless of a hike. For those that don't want too strenuous a walk, a flatter trail exists around the lake."
294,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Yulee, FL ",AESOME,"This place is beautiful! Hiked down to Moose pond and saw a moose. Hiked to the falls, had to do the long way to Inspiration point as the trail was closed. Signs are not the best up there so pay attention and take a map with you. The overlooks of the lake are great, do the whole 7 mile trek around the lake if you can, so worth it."
295,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2017 , Family,"Vine Grove, KY ",Beautiful!,We hiked around the lake and to the Moose Ponds. The trails are in good shape and there are many good photo ops. We were fortunate enough to see a moose at the pond. Beautiful lake with gorgeous mountain views!

It's nearing completion, but go anyway. The views are stunning, at the foot of the mountains you came to see. Don't miss the one hour cruise tour, at bargain price! If you're up to to it, a hike all away around the lake is rewarding."
298,Jenny_Lake,May 2017 , Solo,"Mesa, AZ ",Ferry and Inspiration Point closed for 2017,Folks the shuttle ferry across the lake and trail to Inspiration Point are closed for 2017. Just thought readers may want to plan ahead. The Jenny Lake parking area is under construction and visitor center is being replaced. For 2017 you may want to visit String Lake and Leigh Lake instead. They are all beautiful.
299,Jenny_Lake,May 2017 , Couples, ,Must do on way to Yellowstone,We stayed the night in Jackson before taking the drive by tour of Grand Teton. Jenny Lake was a very nice foreground for killer shots of Grand Teton mountains. lots of easy trails from parking lot to shore's edge. Beautiful lake.

302,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2016 , Friends,New Jersey ,Stunning views all around,"My cousins and I visited Jenny Lake on our trip to the Tetons in Oct 2016. We had limited time in the park and saw most of it by car with stops to walk around. Since we did not have ample time for a long hike, Jenny Lake was a short walk from where we parked our car and we were not disappointed. It wasn't crowded, the water was crystal clear, and we just sat for a while and took it all in. Absolutely can't miss if you're going to Grand Teton National Park!"
303,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family, ,"Beautiful views, decent hiking","A beautiful lake with gorgeous views that made every moment picturesque, absolutely a must see. The hiking was good, not as breathtaking as the views, and was absolutely stunning all around."

308,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Vancouver, Canada ",One of the highlights of the park!,"Jenny Lake is definitely pretty. It is one of the highlights of Grand Teton NP and it is worth the visit.  However, the overlook area is overcrowded, especially in summer."
309,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Coeur d'Alene, ID ",Stunning beauty,The views and the wonder of all this is just breathtaking. I am thrilled to have been priviledged to have seen this.
310,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2016 , Couples, ,What a Beautiful Lake!,Jenny Lake is such a beautiful location. We hiked partway around the lake to the waterfalls by Inspiration Point before turning back. It's a popular trail for a reason.
311,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2016,not available,"Edgewood, NM ",WONDERFUL AREA,"We drove the loop road around the tetons it was wonderful, so many pull offs and sites to see. Must go up Signal Mountain for a breath taking view"
312,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Toms River, NJ ",beautiful lake,This is a large and beautiful lake for picnics or hikes with beautiful mountain scenery surrounding it. It is one of several lakes in Grand Teton National Park.
313,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Rochester, NY ",Stunning and Breathtaking,"Jenny Lake was a scenic stop on our Caravan Bus Tour. I was truly stunned and speechless and not prepared for the beauty of it all. I'll have to agree with everything that has been said by the other reviewers, at the risk of sounding repetitive. Take a good camera and give yourself plenty of time to soak in this beautiful attraction."
314,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Venlo, The Netherlands ",Amazing Jenny Lake,"We checked out what to see near Moran, Wyoming and read about Jenny Lake and we were amazed by this beautiful Lake even though it was a cloudy fresh day.  You can walk a trail and have beautiful sights along your walk.  We would not have wanted to miss this!"
315,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Vero Beach, FL ",A highlight of our Grand Teton NP visit,"We took the shuttle boat (modest fee) from the Jenny Lake Visitor Center to the trail that leads to Inspiration Point. This is a popular trail (about 1/2 mile) with spectacular views. The last 1/3 of the trail is fairly steep, so take your time.  My wife had had a hip replacement six months earlier so she only made it to the Hidden Falls stop-off; unfortunately the viewing point for the Falls was closed for construction, so the falls were really hidden (but you could hear them).    There are various options for hiking from the Jenny Lake VC; you can hike all the way around the lake or you can take the shuttle one way and hike over or back to/from the trail to Inspiration Point or you can take the shuttle over and back like we did."
316,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Chelmsford, UK ",Amazing,As with nearly everything we say on our road trip this lake and surrounding area are amazing - the views well worth a visit - glad we stopped and didn't miss it.
317,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Portland, ME ",Beautiful. Hike,Parked at trailhead and enjoyed undulating hike around lake to inspiration point trailhead. It's all uphill from there. Enjoyed spectacular view from top. Saw a mule train on the trail and a moose in the distance. Recommend for all levels of ability
318,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Spring Hill, Tennessee, United States ",Such a beautiful lake with the Tetons as a backdrop.,This was one of the many things we visited while in the Grand Teton National Park. A must see! There are so many photo ops here and a great place to relax as well. Take a boat ride and do some hiking.
319,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Business,"Chicago, IL, ",Nice,This is a nice lake very close to the highway if you are driving from Jackson Hole to Yellowstone. It's worth a quick stop and look.
320,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",Gorgeous,We hiked to and from inspiration point. Another day we just parked and sat to enjoy the view. My favorite spot in all of Grand Tetons. There is a nice store with some basic snacks and drinks as well as gifts at the Jenny Lake Visitor Center.
321,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Family,Alabama ,Tranquility,Jenny Lake invites you to pause life for a few moments and sit on the shore and soak in the beauty of creation. It is so beautiful surrounded by the majestic Teton mountains.
322,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Minneapolis, MN ",Trail Head String on this lake was fantastic,We did a day hike on this lake - take the String Trail as it goes around the rapidly moving creek and river on your left and the mountains on your right. To reach this trail you need to go across the small bridge to the left of the parking area.
323,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Crystal River, FL ",A beautiful clear mountain lake,Lovely views of a clear mountain lake surrounded by mountains. Access by car or numerous hiking trails.
324,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Syosset, NY ","Excellent hiking but get there early or late, parking limited","Took the boat shuttle and hiked up to Inspiration point (about 1.5 miles). You can also hike 3 miles each way from the parking lot. Due to construction, it was difficult to find parking and I had to circle the lot for about 15 minutes until I found a car pulling out. Arrive early or later in day, instead of the lunch time hour like I did."
325,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Lincoln, UK ",Very Scenic.,We only stopped for a short while to admire the view of this relatively small lake with dramatic mountains behind. I would recommend if you have the time to go for a walk here and experience it more fully.
326,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Westport, CT ",Not to be missed!,"When exploring Grand Teton National Park, you MUST stop at Jenny Lake and take in the breathtaking views! Absolutely magnificent! There are trails to walk on while taking lots of photo opportunities! The lake is so pretty with the mountains behind.....like a postcard!"
327,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"La Plata, MD ",Boating then Hiking,"We took the boat across Jenny Lake then hiked up the mountain there. There were many interesting rocks and waterfalls along the way to the view. We saw pikas running in the rocks, too. One of my favorite places in the park."
328,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Friends,"Rockville, MD ","Great boat ride to Cascade Canyon Hike - popular, but also very beautiful","Another great hike near the lake is the Amphitheater Hike. The lake is cold and deep, so probably not the best place for a kayak ride."
329,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,Wigan ,A good boat tour,When visiting the Teton National Park we took a boat tour on Jenny Lake. Our guide and boat driver Kyle was very informative and interesting. It was a good trip and we learned a lot about the Teton Mountains and of course Jenny Lake. The trip lasted one hour and was good value for money.
330,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016,not available,"Schulenburg, TX ",Jenny Lake,Breathtaking. Be sure to have your video a d camera with you. One of our favorite spots on our trip through the west.
331,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"London, UK ","Beautiful for walking, swimming, canoeing",We stayed in Jenny Lake Campground for 4 days and made the short walk towards the lake every day - it's especially beautiful in the early morning
332,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Mims, FL, ",take a boat ride,"Beautiful Lake, surrounded by Teton snow capped peaks. We both took a cruise and walked around Lake."
333,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,Texas ,Start Early and go all the way around,"We started just before 7 AM. The early morning climbers/hikers were already lined up for the first shuttle boat of the day. We hiked all the way around the lake (6.5 miles) in about three hours. This is an easy flat hike with lots of pretty views and places to stop along the way. There is a short section that follows the road that was a bit annoying (who hikes to listen to traffic?!) but overall this was a great ""warm up"" hike as we got used to the altitude and planned for more difficult hikes. Go early to avoid parking issues and to have the trail more to yourself, we only saw half a dozen other groups by starting early. Restrooms and general store available at the south trailhead."
334,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Bergen, Norway ",Well worth the hike,"We started early before the parking lot started to fill up. We hiked around to where the boat took us back to the start. Lovely hike in idyllic terrain. We should have brought bear spray as we did meet a bear near the path, but it was peacefully eating raspberries and didn't mind us, so we just walked quietly on. The trip up to the lookout was quite strenuous and steep, though. Lovely boat trip back. I strongly recommend the hike!"
335,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Idaho Falls, ID ",Beautiful.,We took the ferry across the lake to hike inspiration point. So worth the price of the ferry ride. The Teton's are so beautiful from this location.
336,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples, ,Gorgeous and Secluded,"We just went here and had an absolute blast. The views were incredible and the water is gorgeous. The Tetons are some of the most beautiful mountains in the U.S. and this lake sits at the base of them. Beware, the water is freezing since this is a glacial lake! I recommend going in the dead of the summer (mid July) and the hottest point of the day, to maximize your visit, although this might be a more crowded time with tourists. If you think you can brave the freezing water, then go in early to mid august. I recommend pulling off the road and hiking down to the lake. That's what we did, and we were secluded; the only ones there to enjoy the beauty of it. It was so fun. It is very rocky, so wear good shoes when you hike down, and I recommend water shoes, especially for little ones."
337,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,NC ,A REAL BEAUTY,"If you get the chance stop by and look at this gorgeous lake. We visited Aug 2016, and the wonder is beautiful and w/ the backdrop of the Tetons behind it, it really was photo worthy.    We made our way to the water, and removed our shoes to stick our toes in.... felt great! The water was very clear; we also sat there and skipped pebbles."
338,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Weddington, NC ",Beautiful hike!,"We hiked to Inspiration point at 9 in the morning and it was perfect. Our return trip was very crowded, as the park gets so busy the later in the day it gets. The construction is annoying, but we had a good conversation with one of the stone masons, which was interesting."
339,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016,not available, ,Beautiful Lake,"We took a boat tour on Jenny Lake. The boat captain was knowledgeable. The stories of how the mountains came to be, the story of the name Jenny Lake was fascinating. The lake is so beautiful."
340,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Montague, MI ",Great time,Husband and I went to Jenny Lake and camped in a tent for the first time! I really enjoyed it. We were able to hike and saw many wild animals from deer to moose and birds to a bear! We also rented a canoe and spent a day on the lake! This was an awesome vacation and I am looking forward to coming again!
341,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Friends, ,Spectacular,Beautiful scenery and very tranquil when we visited late afternoon. A lot of restoration work was taking place but this couldn't take away from the spectacular location
342,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family, ,Beautiful View,"We stopped by Jenny Lake on our way from Teton to Yellowstone. They were doing construction in the parking lot to the main area, so we did the scenic drive which takes you along the lake with a few pullout points to take pictures and venture down to the water."
343,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,Utah ,Way overcrowded and under construction,"This place is the quintessence of Grand Teton but is under renovation and is a total nightmare of parking, people, and construction. We hiked the West side of the lake trail up to Inspiration Point (Hidden Falls is also closed under renovation) and then rode the ferry back. Excellent hike and definitely improved after the first mile when the short distance walkers dropped of the trail and we had a slice of solitude. Stick to the higher trail at the fork to avoid losing and regaining elevation if you plan to visit Inspiration Point. The ferry ride back was the perfect reward for the kids (aged 8 and 12) after a substantial hike."
344,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family, ,Inspiration Point!,Go early as a lot of people do not have hike etiquette. It's gets super busy and people get pushy towards the top as the trail bottle necks. We did see a black bear which was awesome.
345,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Orange, CA ",Amazing,B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L! This is just one of spots where you can back and just enjoy being in God's land. It is just so peaceful and relaxing!
346,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",The classic,"Iconic Teton views and easy hiking...A must for all visitors, whether their first or tenth visit. Don't miss it."
347,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Allendale, NJ ",In my top top 10,"My family and I spent a day at Jenny Lake just to soak up the natural beauty it has to offer .  We walked from the north parking area on the scenic road path .  We got there early in the day to beat the crowds . Words cannot explain what is waiting for you . I sat there for 30 minutes just staring at the blue water with the reflection of the massive mountains in the foreground . It literally took my breath away . If you go , take a minute, breathe in the fresh air and realize the beauty that our country has to offer . Definately one of my favorite places I have been ."
348,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Santa Clarita, CA ",Inspiration Point at Jenny Lake!!,"Beautiful hike up to Inspiration Point is a must! The hike was easy and the view was amazing. We only had a couple of hours, so we took the boat ride across the lake rather than hiking around, and then just did the hike to the top from the dock. If you have more time, 4 hours or so, I would recommend hiking the trail around the lake too."
349,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Lake Geneva, WI ",Great place for a day hike,"We start our hike at 7:00 am and at around 11:30 we finished our hike around the whole lake and to the Inspiration point as well. The hike is beautiful but we are all exhausted after. The inspiration point is a must go place, which offers a nice view of the lake from a high ground."
350,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Idaho Falls, ID ",One of the most beautiful places on earth.,Went with my family and everyone had a great time. Took the boat across the lake a hiked up the canyon a little ways. Played in the stream. They were undergoing considerable construction near the visitors center when we visited but once you got near the lake things got a little back to normal. I would still recommend visiting the Tetons are spectacular even better than Yellowstone in my opinion.
351,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family, ,Under construction!,"I visited on July 2016, but it's under construction around visitor center, and Hidden Fall trail was closed. So, My family was very disappointed. We took a canoe, but had to stop it because of sudden bad weather. However, they charged us the same price. Lake is not so beautiful comparing to the other lake in Glacier NP."
352,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Bucket list,My family and I visited Jenny Lake in July 2016. The Jenny Lake area is under construction and parking is limited. I would suggest arriving before 9:00 am. We arrived at 8:15 am and had no problems with parking or long lines to ride the ferry across the lake. The hike to Inspiration Point is a must see.
353,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016,not available,"Phoenix, AZ ",Unreal beauty and activities for a full range of visitors!,"All of the various activities are enough to keep everyone busy... from novice hikers to more outdoor enthusiasts. The lake has great camping, great rocky shores you can turn into your private beach and access to a ton of hiking... all right on the base of the gorgeous Tetons. Still amazed."
354,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Salinas, CA ",Beautiful drive,We drove the park road that goes by Jenny Lake and it was such a beautiful drive. The views were stunning. I must do.
355,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Texas, ",Parking tight this summer but is a beautiful spot,"Welcome to Grand Tetons National Park = If you don't like summer tourists traffic, go very early by vehicle or anytime by bike or on a hike. There is construction in the main visitor parking areas - be nice to the rangers who are trying hard to help everyone. We chose to ride our bikes into the park and love the paved hike & bike trail system all over the Jackson/ Jackson Hole area - it's fantastic. We rode our bikes through the front gate of the park up to Jenny Lake - about 8 miles each way. The lake is far bigger than one imagines due to the immense Grand Tetons Range as the visual backdrop. There is a tourist ferry ride and other boating options to get out on the water, plus hiking trails and driving overlooks. It's a beautiful spot!"
356,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016,not available,"New Jersey, ",Shared the view with the wildlife,"Jenny Lake is a beautiful stop in the heart of Grand Teton National Park. You are able to take boat rides around the lake to absorb the beauty of the area or just take a shuttle back and forth so you can hike the area. Were were standing there taking in the view when our children realized there was a deer standing right next to us. The deer eventually waded into the water and across stream, but not before we got some cool pictures of the experience."
357,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Aurora, CO ",Look for the scenic drive and Jenny Lake Overlook,"We read amazing reviews of Jenny Lake and also complaints about the construction. We drove through the campgrounds and it looked congested. THEN we found the Jenny Lake Scenic Drive - a short, not-busy scenic drive that lead to the most beautiful overlook of our entire trip. Even though we were traveling with a dog and therefore not hiking, we loved the drive and stopped at the overlook for awesome views!"
358,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Waterbury, VT ",Simply Stunning!,"The moment we rolled up on Jenny lake from one of the scenic pull-outs we were blown away. We've seen some beautiful lakes in our travels but Jenny Lake is now towards the top, if not at the top, of our list.    We were also lucky enough to have the lake to ourselves when we went kayaking on our inflatable kayaks from Advanced Elements. The only other boats we saw were the tour/shuttle boats we saw in the distance.    If you are going to go out on the water on your own craft, make sure to go to the Lupine area for the boat launch."
359,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Saint Charles, MO ",Jam packed,"Such a shame. This was nice 30 years ago. Parking lot a zoo, area and trails under construction, might as well be an amusement park queue line there are so many people doing this hike."
360,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Mineola, NY ","Great Views All Around, the Hike is Great and Worth it, but Can be a Bit Tough","My wife, me and our boys (ages 16 and 18) visited this spot with a group tour. We boarded a ferry across the lake (a nice ride) and the scenery is just fantastic -- it is a post card in every direction you look. I can't comment on the price of the ferry though as it was part of the tour. It did not seem too bad though.    At the other side of the lake, we got off a small dock and there was a hiking trail to falls and then a lookout point (Inspiration Point) with fantastic views. There are multiple points along the hike where you get great views and for portions of it, you are hiking next to a river which also has some cool views. One note -- there is construction right now so apparently, you cannot get close to the falls like you could without the construction. It is still a beautiful hike but know this going in -- you only can get a further away view of the falls (and not a great one) while the construction is going on.    Additionally, my family and I are from Long Island. This hike is at altitude (about 6,000 feet) and I would say that the last third of it is a little steep. It is manageable and the boys had less trouble than me and my wife but if you are coming from sea level, you may have to stop a few times on the way up. It is not that long though and it is absolutely worth it though as the views are great. If you are in the area, this should be a must do."
361,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2016,not available,Georgia ,"Breath taking views, take the boat save your legs for the hike up","Get there by 9 a.m. or finding a parking spot is a disaster in July. We got there by 9 got a spot and took our 8 and 12 year old on the boat over to the start of Inspiration point hike. The ride is $15 a person but worth it if you have kids under 12 because otherwise their legs will be too tired before you even start the hike up to Inspiration point. I will say the hike up was amazing with some of the most beautiful scenery, rushing waterfalls, and views I've ever seen. Go past inspiration point another mile if your kids can make it. It was awesome!!!"
362,Jenny_Lake,May 2016 , Friends,"Castle Rock, CO ",Hike,"We did a long hike around Jenny Lake and then back into the canyon. It was spectacular. If you want to hike to the lake in the canyon and out again in one day, you need to leave really early or just plan on camping. I wasn't prepared and didn't make it to the lake but the hike was fantastic! Even ran into a couple of moose."
363,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Margate, FL ",Fantastic Views,Jenny Lake is one of the areas in the Park that everyone goes to. The parking lot was full. We had to park on the side of the road. Get here early. There is a General Store with a snack shop.  There were quite a few Porta-Pottys. Pretty clean. (there was construction).  The boat dock charges $15 round trip to the other side of the lake. A nice short 10 minute trip.  The trail on the other side was closed for construction(Hidden Falls and Inspiration point). There was an alternate trail though you cannot get close to the falls. The river was raging pretty good. You can get a few views in to Cascade Canyon.(long hike if you are up for it). The trail is pretty easy. Not too much elevation gain.  I would say this is a must.
364,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Hollywood, FL, ",Amazing hikes for the views !!!,"We loved this place, it is so beautiful!  We took the boat to the other side of the lake and did a hike for the view, then we hiked all the way back to the parking lot, it is about an hour back and so a moose on a little lake on ur way back!"
365,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Westerham, UK ",Gorgeous easy'ish hike,The 7-mile loop around Jenny lake is a gorgeous easy-moderate hike with options to branch off/extend the hike to Hidden Falls and/or Inspiration Point. Distance can also be shortened by taking the shuttle boat.
366,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Avon, CO ",Pretty stop to take in the view,We loved this lake - we had a picnic here after picking up DQ on the way. So pretty and peaceful. Would like to stay longer next time.
367,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,Indiana ,Favorite Day at the Tetons,"One of our favorite memories of our Tetons/Yellowstone vacation involved hiking Cascade Canyon trail. We took the boat ride across Jenny Lake to help ""save"" our 7 year-old's legs to get deeper into the trail (a bit expensive, but to us worth the time saved). We hiked on past Inspiration Point into the canyon (although not all the way to the end of the trail since our daughter was tiring). It is a beautiful trail! We saw 2 moose in the canyon as well. The only disappointment is the spur trail to Hidden Falls is closed right now, but you can get a glimpse of the falls still. Get there early! We arrived in time to catch the second or third boat across (7:30 a.m.). By the time we left, the parking lot was overflowing and people were hiking up the trail in droves, although the crowd thins out once you get past inspiration point. Where comfy shoes, take water and snacks, and spend time enjoying the view!"
368,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,Pawnee ,Beautiful,This was a beautiful lake. We took the boat across and then hiked up to hidden falls. We also did the 1 hour scenic cruise of the lake. We loved this and found it very informative. Lots of information about how the lake was formed and glacial forces in the area.
369,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Sioux City, IA ",Always beautiful,"This lake is beautiful and very popular. The trails can get crowded unless you start early and the parking area also gets crowded. Even so, it's still a nice place to get out and walk around even if you aren't interested in hiking."
370,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Hollywood, FL ",Nature at its Best,"After speaking with a local who worked at the Boat Dock, I have the best advice for potential visitors. HIKE FIRST THEN TAKE THE BOAT BACK. If you hike first (I recommend it in the am before it gets too busy), you will take a very nice 2.5 mile stroll (mostly flat with some moderate hills). At the end you will have a very nice surprise, take a seat and breathe in the beauty. Afterwards, you can take the boat ride back and be able to let your hike sink in while you see the lake and the Grand Tetons in the background."
371,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,Atlanta ,Who was Jenny?,"Lake Jenny: take the boat and then go on a hike. You can hike around Lake Jenny or hop the boat and take a hike. Either way, this is a pleasant way to see the lake, forest, and mountains. Hint: check on departure times. Point of history-the lake was formed by glaciers. Lake Jenny is named after a Shoshone Native American woman who married an Englishman. Before her 30th birthday, she and her six children died from smallpox in 1876."
372,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Beautiful and Popular Lake,You need to visit Jenny Lake if you are in the area --it is scenic and lovely. There were a ton of bugs however and I got bitten a lot. Nice place for a family walk.
373,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015,not available,"Ijamsville, MD ",Great Hike,"Great, moderately stressful hike, great views. Took the long way around the lake, then the falls, back to the boat for the short trip back to the parking area. Great day!"
374,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Columbus, OH ",Saw a moose!,"We did the boat ride across Jenny Lake to hike to Inspiration Point. I think the boat tickets are expensive for such a short ride (there are 6 in our family so it adds up!) but we didn't want to hike around the lake because the cloudy sky was threatening rain and I'm paranoid about running into bears while hiking (I like to stay on busy, highly traveled trails, lol)    Go in the morning or evening as it seemed to rain almost every afternoon (at least when we visited in early June). Also parking becomes an issue...there were quite a few spots when we arrived at 10am but by the time we left at 1pm cars were circling the parking lot like vultures, waiting for open spots. Apparently the parking situation is even worse this year (2016) because of the construction going on.    We saw a mama moose with 2 babies near the boat dock! (the dock near the parking lot) And someone on the trail to Inspiration Point said they saw a grizzly near the other dock (the dock at the trail head).    Overall Jenny Lake was nice and the boat ride was fun (albeit expensive) but I thought Jackson Lake was more scenic--my favorite spot was the pebble beach at the Colter Bay picnic area. If If I were short on time I would choose Jackson Lake over Jenny. But we only had one moose sighting during our 3 days in GTNP and it was at Jenny Lake so I'm glad we went!"
375,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Haslemere, UK ","Beatiful lake, but remember the altitude for the hike","We were going to walk all the way around Jenny Lake, which is spectacular, but realising the altitude we took the ferry across the lake and walked back. A wise decision as this at about 7,000 ft."
376,Jenny_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,"McCalla, AL ",Lovely Lake!,"This is a beautiful lake in the Grand Tetons National Park. There is a boat ride over to the falls. We did not do this due to time limits. However, if you are visiting the park, you must at least drive to the lake and take some photos. It is one stop that you don't want to miss!"
377,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,Sherman Oaks ,Hiking at Jenny Lake,"Take the boat across the lake, most people hike up to Inspiration Point, to avoid the crowds go to your right and take the horse trail to the Cassacade Canyon trail. You can hike up the canyon as far as you like, there is a stream and it is fairly level. When you return you can hike back via Inspiration Point and take in the view of the lake and valley."
378,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Tampa, Florida, Usa ",Too much construction,A beautiful setting but the hiking trails are being reinforced for safety. The construction interferes with the beauty and will continue thru 2017 according to the signs. Try other hiking areas instead.
379,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Jacksonville, OR ",Under repair,The area near Jenny Lake store/campground is currently being improved by replacing the sanitary infrastructure and trail restructure among other changes. Currently very congested and dusty.
380,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Corona, CA ",1/2 day adventure for all ages!,"Spent a little over 3 hours hiking, eating, taking pictures. Probably estimated 4 miles round trip.    This was actually 'family with grown adults' but there wasn't a selection option for that in the app. We spent 2 days at Grand Teton, one of the days was spent at Jenny Lake. As reference there are 4 of us, my brother and I are in our 20/30s and my parents are in their 60s. We were there by 8:30am/9am , which was good because we were still able to get parking. After a certain time, the Rangers said that parking backs up and you may need to park and walk in.    We took the boat across the lake. $15 for adults, $12 for seniors roundtrip. They will give you a stamp for admission. Boat comes every 15 min and is 10-15min ride. Sit in the front if it's a cold day, as it is windy in the back of the boat. You can also walk around the lake to get to the hiking point which is I think is 2.5 miles each way, see attached map. Since I was going with my parents we decided to save our energy for the actual hike to Inspiration Point.    It took us probably 1 - 1 1/2 hours to get to inspiration point and a little bit pass that to Cascade Canyon. The whole way up is slightly steep and you have to watch where you are walking as there are uneven rocks, see pictures. If you have hiking sticks bring them as they could be helpful, mostly for my parents.    Pack a lunch to bring with you so that you can eat at inspiration point. Would be good to stop at the grocery store to get some sandwiches, there is one in Colter Bay.    If you decide to keep hiking past inspiration point, there is another 9 miles of hiking. We did some of it and then decided to turn around and go back down as it was more of the same.    Overall it was a fun thing to do in the Grand Tetons."

382,Jenny_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,"Houston, TX, ",Gorgeous,"With the Tetons as the backdrop for this beautiful lake, it's picture perfect. We didn't hike but drove along the edge, stopping at an easy pull off to have a picnic lunch. The views are spectacular. So serene and majestic. Don't miss this area!"
383,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Belmont, NC, ",Peaceful View,We drove down to Jenny Lake and parked to visit and take pictures. Some people there were hiking on the trails. There is a large parking area and several places to sit and inhale the view. The lake is small but the Grand Tetons are a beautiful back ground. If you are near by do not miss this stop.
384,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2016 , Solo,"Fairfax, Virginia ",Absolutely Gorgeous.,This was my second time back to Jackson Hole and my first time to Jenny Lake. It is a must. Gorgeous at any time of the day. The water reflects the mountains perfectly. You could not find a better view. I was a solo traveler and felt safe the entire time.
385,Jenny_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,"Mesa, AZ ",Wonderful day spent here.,"Jenny Lake is at the foot of Grand Teton mountain. You cannot get a better view in my opinion. We took the ferry one way and then hiked. Roaring falls, river, fantastic view. Easy hiking. A lot of work went into making the trail as good as it is. Work is being done now on the trail after the falls, so it is closed beyond the falls. Still worthwhile. After hiking to falls, we hiked all the way around the lake back to the ferry dock where our pickup was parked. Total distance walked 9 miles. Time spent about 6 1/2 hours. We were very tired but it was well worth it. The scenery is simply jaw dropping. I am from Colorado and this place is unlike anything I ever saw in Colorado. Ferry ride is short. Bring water if you hike. There are some rest rooms along some trails, but inquire so you know where they are. You can hike as much or as little as you want. Simply the best. Trails are easy and well marked."
386,Jenny_Lake,May 2016 , Family,"Sunset Beach, NC ",Wow Wow Wow,"We entered close to the East boat dock and hiked around the lake up to Inspiration Point...maybe 1 hour hike. Saw a moose, chipmunks, owls, and a beautiful view of the crystal clear lake and majestic mountains surrounding the lake. Simple hike that wasn't strenuous. The roaring falls around Inspiration Point make it worth any effort. The West boat ramp is just beyond the falls for a quick trip back across if you don't feel like making the 7 mile loop."
387,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Livingstone, Zambia ","Nice Hike, Amazing Views","We hiked around the lake in the early morning and observed moose and bear. The hike up to Inspiration Point was worth the effort. Our 8 and 11 year old made the trip without any problem. We choose to take the boat ride back, which was worth the time it saved."
388,Jenny_Lake,May 2016 , Family,"Denver, CO ",Mid lake hike,Stopped about mid-lake along the one-way road. Went hiking along the lake-side trail. The trail near the parking was ADA design and provided great views of the lake and Tetons.
389,Jenny_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,"Cincinnati, Ohio ",Hiking at Jenny Lake,"My wife and I hiked around the area and then took the boat to hike to Inspiration Point. The view of Jenny Lakr from 7200 feet was breath taking. If you can hike it, well worth the effort!"

392,Jenny_Lake,May 2015 , Couples,"Broken Arrow, OK ",WOW!,"Just your regular run of the mill pristine glacial lake at the very base of THE TETONS. Very hard to believe that this has hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Lush, dense forests that suddenly open up to one of THE most beautiful lakes in North America. Being able to feast your eyes on this crystal clear lake backed by the TETONS is almost too much to behold at one time. YES, it IS that lovely! Mere words and even photos do not do it justice! Sure the ""other"" parks in the neighborhood get most of the attention, but for those few who take the road less traveled only they get to miss the crowds and have nature all to themselves. Take the time to really explore, hike or just take a boat ride to explore this gem of the state. You may leave, but your heart will be there forever."
393,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Friends,"Cozumel, Mexico ",Great end to a AWESOME trip,We ended our hike here and it was such a cool way to end since you walk out of the forest and see this huge and beautiful lake. What a nice sight for soar feet.
394,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2015 , Business,"Jackson, WY, ",Magnificent!,"To be precise, this is more of a Moose, Wyoming attraction rather than in Moran but it's not far!  Whether you take a boat across to hike 2 kilometers up 130 meters to inspiration point or if you walk 10 kilometers around the lake or just stop to enjoy the view, this is a pristinely breathtaking site. I recommend you check out string and Leigh lakes just to the north while you're in the vicinity!  Just so you know, during the winter it is a 7 km Nordic ski or snowshoe in from the south or 14 km from the north or Moran approach. In April, visitors can bicycle or skate in on roads referee if cars until 1 May but some days the weather can be blustery."
395,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Rome, Italy ",One of the most beautiful lakes ever visited,"The park is so beautiful and really well organized. just the parking is a bit small, you need to come early in the morning. to visit the Jenny Lake you can walk for several hours or take the boat for a 15 mins trip and continue hiking close the lake, to get the top and join a wonderful outlook. great experience, great place, great park"
396,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015,not available,"Manchester, UK ",Disapointing & not worth all the effort,"Its a 20 minute drive out of Jackson.  Tip make a note of were you park your car, also take plenty of water & walking poles if you have them.  It costs $8 each for the 10 minute boat wide to the other side of the picturesque lake.  Then its a very strenuous steep gradient one & a half mile hike over mostly uneven & broken rock ( Any body with a heart condition should think twice before doing this walk)  Took one & a half hours to reach the panoramic view.  We decided to walk back one & a half miles to our car & not get the boat back which took us another 90 minutes.  Ok if you are in Jackson this is one of the high light thing to do & if you a fit enough you should do it.  You may love it, I though I have seen much better"
397,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Mirror of the Tetons,"When you visit he Grand Tetons and have made the Lodge inspection, save a day for hiking and boating on this mirror of the Tetons. The Park Service Staff is helpful and readily available. The walking trails are well marked and maintained. Go early as parking (especially with the construction) is at a premium."
398,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015,not available,"Jackson Hole, WY ",Breathtaking Lake,"We couldn't hike it because there was too much bear activity :( but the lake itself is absolutely gorgeous and a must see on any trip. Its usually open, has a variety of trails that aren't too hard. You can't see Teton Natl Park without coming here."

400,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2015 , Couples,"Moscow, ID ","Very lovely, a little basic, great views, not many families","So I used to go here as a child, and my parents wanted us kids to return so we all went out as adults together for one last time. The hotel lodge is lovely, and this is very high end. The cost is pretty astronomical for the room. The room my sisters were in the first night was chilly, but the staff were right on it the next day when we reported that we were cold, they put in a space heater. The accommodations are nice, think upscale cabin. Lovely appointments, and the view is why you come here. IT's just at the foot of the mountains and gorgeous, great hiking. It used to be a place that was a bit more informal, with kids running around more, now it's a grayer place with more retirees, but everyone was friendly and happy to have us. I think it would be great if your family likes to hike, if you prefer shopping or playing games together in the lodge, that doesn't happen as much. Great place."
401,Jenny_Lake,Oct 2015 , Couples,"Bloomfield, CT ",Crystal clear water,The crystal clear waters of Jenny Lake are perfect to provide a mirror-like reflection surface for the gorgeous Grand Teton Mountains.

When we got back to the car 5 long hours later, we had walked 12 miles It was beautiful, but we might have done a shorter route if we had known."

Be advised the the store, visitors center, and plumbed restrooms are closed for the season. The hike to Hidden Falls was around 2 miles one way with multiple ups / downs in the form of steps, but it provided wonderful views of the lake and the falls- worth doing."
407,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples, ,Reach out and touch the Tetons.,"Even in cold rain it's worth it. If you like mountains, this is a must-see! The Tetons feel so close at Jenny Lake, and look like they are practically coming out of the lake because the land is so flat before the mountains. Amazing."
408,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Mena, AR ",Pretty lake with a great view of the Tetons,A real pretty lake with some great views of the Tetons. We spent some time here just checking out all the great views as well as some time at the little gift shop. Worth the trip to go see.
409,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Umatilla, OR ",pretty but not spectacular,Jenny Lake sits at the base of the Teton Mountains. the loop in the Teton Mountains you could easily do in one day there is a boat ride about 20 minutes to the mountains of the Tetons that you can get off to walk to a waterfall then about 5 miles to some cascades apparently there is a 20 mile hiking only loop around the base of the Tetons. the boat ride is not expensive maybe $15 round trip. The Teton Mountains are great for families with little children you can relax more than the loop in Yellowstone. there are lazy rivers paved cycling Paths for bicycle riders and lots of open prairie field areas for horseback riding. most of the lodges have places to eat at and there are a few visitor centers. it's about 30 minutes to the south gate of Yellowstone. Then another 23 miles to the loop of Yellowstone about 45 minutes to an hour to get to the loop of Yellowstone which is a lot of driving. If you want to see Yellowstone and the Tetons I highly recommend staying in Yellowstone Park to see Yellowstone and then staying in the Teton area to see the Tetons in order to see everything. if you want to see moose the only place we saw a moose in the entire Tetons and Yellowstone Park was the stretch from the Tetons to Jackson about 35 minutes to 45 minutes. The best time to see these areas is mid to late September or early October because the summer time is way too hectic to enjoy the parks I would say worse than Disneyland parks as far as crowdedness and late September still has visitor centers open although the lodges inside the park are closed after September 16th you don't need to stay in the park to see everything especially in the Teton area because it is not as spread out as Yellowstone loop. If you're going to snowmobile the best place to stay is Togwotee lodge by far if you only have time to do one park I would definitely do Yellowstone but if you have time to do both it's $50 for both park entrances for up to 7 days
410,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Punta Gorda, FL ",Lovely Lake,"This is a lovely lake and definitely worth the stop. After exiting the overlook, we saw a bull elk foraging in the bushes only about 10 yards from our jeep. Also highly recommend the hike to Hidden Falls which is a total of about 6 miles from the parking lot and back. The path is a bit rugged and rocky in areas so wear good shoes."
411,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Family,"Chattanooga, TN, ",Beautiful! And very accesible,"Jenny Lake is a hub of activity in the Grand Teton park--there is a store, bathrooms, and a little ranger station/museum in buildings scattered around the parking area, then a short flat trail down to the boat dock, or past it to walk around the lake. We took the boat ($15 adult round trip) across to the bottom of a couple of trails. Inspiration point is the steeper, longer of the two, we hiked to Hidden Falls which was quite nice. A little steep and rocky, but not a hard path and the falls were full and beautiful when we arrived. The water in the lake is glacial (I assume) and is clear and blue and it's just beautiful."
412,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Chillicothe, IL ",Tranquile,Beautiful and peaceful to look at. Plenty of bison and other animals to spot. Well worth the drive to see it.

419,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples, ,Lovely Lake,I believe this is one of the most beautiful Lakes in the west. It is large and can be viewed from a number of beautiful sites. Looks a little different each day.
420,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Doylestown, PA ",Amazing Scenery,"We hiked halfway around Jenny Lake to see Hidden Falls and so we saw a lot of it and even dipped our feet into the cool water. At times I thought I was on the Coast of Maine with the rocky coastline, other times I would see the tall Peaks behind the lake and remember where I was. The trail was not crowded until we reached the Hidden Falls turn off. Keep in mind there is a nice drive to get an even prettier view straight across. Only regret is not having time to do the trail that went all the way around the Lake...next time..."
421,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Saint Paul, MN ",Breathtaking views!,Jenny Lake with the tetons in the background is breathtaking. Make sure to take the boat shuttle to Cascade Canyon trail.

Worth a stop if you are driving past the area!!"
425,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Ludlow, UK, ",Possibly the highlight of the Tetons,"Seeing Mount Moran from across Jenny Lake has to be one of the most fantastic sights in all of the GT National PArk. It blows me away every time.  If you have time to do more than the scenic drive, either take the boat across and hike to the waterfall (or beyond if you can!) or hike from String Lake. The latter approach is less crowded."
426,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Friends,"Wichita, KS ",Great Camping and Views,"My friend and I stayed at the Jenny Lake campground from 8/30 to 9/2. We showed up early on 8/30 and were easily able to get the campsite we wanted. There were still available campsites by 11am. The facilities are nice. Every campsite has a fire ring with grate, a picnic table, and a bear box. The campsite it within walking distance to the lake, the small general store and the Jenny Lake Visitors Center. The views on Jenny Lake are spectacular! We hiked on the trail and down to Moose Ponds, though we didn't see any moose. I recommend getting there early because the parking lot does fill up. Definitely don't miss Jenny Lake!"
427,Jenny_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Wilmington, NC ",Stunning,"Stopped on our ride from Yellowstone National park to Jackson Hole.

428,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Leesburg, VA ","Jenny Lake, More Great Views","The problem with the Grand Tetons is they are just too durn impressive and there are too many places to view them. This one offers a view across a beautiful blue lake with mountains just on the opposite shore. You can't see a lot of peaks from this vantage, but what you can see is spectacular.    While you are there, you may want to learn how the lake got it's name, Be warned though, it is a sad story."

431,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Franklin, TN ",Part of 10 day trip to Yellowstone and Grand Tetons National Parks.,"The boat trip across the lake is short. The Mountain winds kick up the surface chop in the afternoons - spray in your face situation. No harm done. Hidden Falls is OK. Many photo opportunities ( just like Yellowstone and Grand Tetons Parks). Sign said .5 miles to Hidden Falls. I'm over 65. Must have meant vertical distance, but we made it! Chance to get close up to beautiful mountain terrain with waterfall and descending cascades into Jenny Lake. Its worth the time and effort IMO."
432,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Friends,Elk Grove CA ,Serene and Beautiful,Our group of 6 took the Jenny Lake ferry across the gorgeous lake. Our captain Terry was very welcoming. He pointed out eagles and their nests and gave us the history of Jenny Lake. The lake is beautiful. I would have loved to spend more time at Jenny Lake to explore all of its natural wonders. The associates in the gift shop were also very helpful. The restrooms were very clean.
433,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Couples,Alabama ,A Life Long Favorite,I have always loved Jenny Lake even as a child. This visit was no different. Early morning still waters with the Tetons as a back drop. It's just a lovely setting. A lovely place for a pucnic.

Go park at the String lake trail head to the north of Jenny lake and walk along the mostly level trail to hidden falls early in the morning. It will take 2-3 hours depending on your fitness level... but there are very few people who go this way,( until you get to the hidden falls trail). So you can have a quiet hike in the Tetons."

We didn't do any of the hiking, that I'm sure would have been wonderful. But we did kayak the lake. That itself was fun, but we had to wait 30-40 minutes just to get a kayak rental. Fun day, but nothing special or out of the ordinary about the lake itself."
441,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015,not available,"Bethany, CT ",Mama bear and her cub,Jenny Lake was very pretty. We talked to a ranger who said a bear and her cub have been in the area by the bridge regularly. We saw a big buck elk laying down in the shade near the parking lot.
442,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Solo,"Panama City, FL, ",Boat over and hike back,I like to catch an early morning boat across the lake to hike the Hidden Falls and Inspiration trails before the boat and the trail get too terribly crowded. This generally works if I catch a boat before 9am. Then I hike the southern Jenny trail back around the lake to parking area. $9 one way on the boat ($15 round trip if you pay in advance). Bring water/food with you because there are no services on the far side of the lake.
443,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Pocatello, Idaho, United States ",Beautiful views!,I love taking the Jenny Lake boat trip across the lake and going on the hidden falls hike.

444,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",Beautiful lake in beautiful park,"One of our favorite spots in our exploration of Grand Teton. Beautiful and peaceful spot. As others had said, you need to come early or later in the afternoon; we drove by about lunchtime and cars were lining the highway. On the way back from the north end of the park, we took the Jenny Lake scenic drive and ended at the lodge. We picnic'd at the lake for dinner, probably at 6pm, and the parking lot was wide open. Jenny Lake is a national historic district so as a history buff I enjoyed the placards at the various buildings,"
445,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family, ,Boat ride and hike to Hidden Falls,Enjoyed the scenery on a 5 min. boat ride across Jenny Lake and short hike to Hidden Falls. Boat is a good option if you don't have the time to hike around the lake.
446,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,Indiana ,Get here early or it will be insanely packed,"Jenny lake is just beautiful so I cannot give it any less than 5 stars, but if you do not get here early, you will have to park on the road leading into the parking lot. We tried to do the hike one day and it was so packed we couldn't believe it! I have been to many parks and have never seen a trailhead so crowded. The next day we got there around 8 or so and it was great. Much much less traffic and we parked close! But this is a must see if in the Tetons."
447,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Washington DC, DC ",Cascade Canyon hike was great!,"We paid to take the boat ride across Jenny Lake (worth the expense to get ahead of the crowds and bypass a few miles of hiking around the lake) and then hiked into Cascade Canyon - one of the most beautiful and memorable days we have ever experienced. The hardest part of the hike was the initial mile to the cut-off for Inspiration Point where 90% of the visitors/hikers go. We went in the earlier part of the morning so it wasn't crowded. But the number of people we encountered on our descent tot eh boat after InspirationPoint (including a number of older people who really were challenged by the steep climb) was a slight negative. In fact, an older person (reportedly 80 years old) collapsed on the lower part of the trail and a rescue crew was sent out. In short, a relatively easy to moderate climb but go early in the day to beat the crowds and the heat!"
448,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015,not available,"Fort Lauderdale, FL ",My first time hiking,"It was a wonderful experience for my first time. It was breathtaking. There were 11 of us, including 3 children 6 and 2 that were 5, who were able to do the climb. Great pictures."
449,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Easy Hike & Great Views,I hiked this trail last summer and it's pretty easy compared to other mountain hikes. I did this with my 8 year old brother and he had a great time. The view once at the top is a spectacular view of Jenny Lake and the Tetons. This is a good hike for upper elementary kids and up. The only part that one would struggle with is the steeper more rocky incline to the summit of inspiration point. Also don't forget to go back and see the falls also.
450,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family, ,Kayaking was amazing!,We kayaked on the lake -- it was amazing! I highly recommend renting a kayak or canoe for a few hours to enjoy the scenery. We pulled over and had lunch. Saw some deer as well.

The visitors center was very nice and the lake was just beautiful. After an hour a storm was developing and it got really windy. You should take a hike there, there's w high chance you'll see wildlife. Also you may want to consider a boat ride on the lake."
452,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,ND ,Gorgeous!,"We were in the Grand Tetons when we decided to go to Jenny Lake north. It offered some of the most spectacular views we've seen. I told my husband I could be laid to rest there because it was so peaceful. He was brave and went down to the bank (we were in a tourist-y area, so there was no easy access) and managed to capture some breath-taking pictures. We can't wait to go back."
453,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,Ohio ,Beautiful hike to the base of the Tetons around Jenny Lake,"We hiked approx. 3 miles around Jenny Lake and to Hidden Falls. It was a beautiful hike which provided plenty of opportunities for pictures of the lake and the Tetons. we witnessed a couple of rock climbers, which was really neat. It was great to have the option to ride a boat back to the starting point of the trail as a thunderstorm approached and it saved us a 2 mile return hike on a slippery/muddy trail."
454,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"East Earl, PA ",Jenny Lake,"We took the boat across Jenny Lake and had a wonderful ride. Nice trail to walk back to the waterfalls. Saw a elk in the bushes, a hummingbird on the trail and a snake. Very nice lake, nice boat ride, nice trail."

I tried to capture all the beauty in photos but what you take in by sight, sound, and scent of the trees is unbelievable!!! The beauty of nature!! Would highly recommend this excursion!"
456,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Redding, CA ",Stunning Beauty!,Jenny Lake is a jewel in The Teton National Park. It is great for kayaking/canoeing and hiking. We have bumped into moose and bear on our hikes. A must visit place.
457,Jenny_Lake,May 2015,not available,"Idaho Falls, ID ",Jenny Lake,Breathtaking and beautiful anyday and anytime of the year. This is well worth your time and will leave you in awe of Mother Nature
458,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Jacksonville, FL ",Great Family Hike,"Most of the family chose to hike to the falls, but my 16-year old neice decided to take the boat over and meet us there. That is the perfect example of how this hike is great for all levels. The views are spectacular and the falls are well worth the extra effort at the end. Make sure you take off your shoes to give your feet a well-deserved break in the cool waters of the falls."
459,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Clinton, IN ",Beautiful Scenery,Beautiful lake at the base of the Tetons. Take the boat across the lake and hike the Tetons. Fun for everyone in the group and not expensive.
460,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Rochester, NY ",Bring your swim suit!,"My husband and I visited Jenny Lake a few days ago while in the Grand Tetons NP. We loved it!    This place is a well-known gem and heavily trafficked in summer. Prepare to drive around a bit for parking. On the site is a visitor center, general store (where you can grab snacks, ice cream and souvenirs), ranger station and restrooms.    The trail from the parking area to the nearest part of the lake is approx 10 min walk on a hard-dirt path. There is a trail going around the lake, and further down the road another drivable trail with an overlook of both String Lake and Jenny Lake.    We didn't have much time and really regret not having taken a dip into the lake (the crystal clear water looked so inviting!), and not walking the trail (it would have taken about an hour), but the overview area is gorgeous and well worth the drive.    Note: as you exit Jenny Lake visitor center area and head north towards Yellowstone, you'll see cars exiting a road with a 'one-way' sign - this is the end of the drivable road with overview - keep driving north and eventually you'll see the entrance on your left. The driving trail is only a couple miles long and goes quick, but you'll want to give yourself time to park, get out and walk along the 'rim/overlook' trail to appreciate the views. We also encountered park rangers there with great tips for hiking and info about area wildlife."
461,Jenny_Lake,May 2015 , Couples,"Bothell, WA ",Great Hike,"We went to Jenny Lake to hike on the Cascade Canyon. We felt like we were right at home there since we live in the Seattle area and hike the Cascade Mountains frequently. The weather was a little iffy the day we went, but it would be beautiful with sunshine!"
462,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Silver Spring, MD ",Jenny Lake - Grand Teton,"Jenny Lake is absolutely breathtaking. Stopped for a look on our way out of Jackson and heading up to Yellowstone. With the Grand Teton's in the backdrop, there is nothing more beautiful."
463,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Sandy, UT ","Tourists, and canoes, and bears, oh my!","Jenny Lake is a spectacularly beautiful location, with unparalleled scenery. My favorite time to visit in the October, when the air is crisp and the crowds are gone. This time we visited in July, so there were tourists everywhere (as well as quite a few signs stating bears had been frequenting the area). Make sure you go to the visitor center, which is new and interesting. The hike to Hidden Falls is crowded, but beautiful. You can rent a canoe or SUP and paddle around the lake. For peace and solitude, try another area of Teton Park."
464,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Milledgeville, GA ",Hidden Falls a Must See!,"The Jenny Lake hike to Hidden Falls will take a couple hours to hike each way (unless you pay for the ferry), but the views of the falls are spectacular. Recommend you pack a lunch and take a break somewhere near the falls as a perfect lunch spot!"
465,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Boise, Idaho ",Don't miss the lake!,Just stopped to see the lake. Breathtaking!! The turnout is always crowded but well worth the view you get when you stop. There is a south end and a north end. Don't miss he north end!
466,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,Mint Hill ,A wide variety of trails and awesome scenery.,"Another place that will kill your camera/phone battery. Take car chargers and plenty of storage. If you are up to it, go on some of the hikes around the lake. There are many different difficulty levels."
467,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",This gem is a must see.,"Crowded parking lot and limited places to sit and enjoy the scenery, but a nice walkway for some beautiful vistas. Some nice picnic areas, but little view from the tables. Walking trail around the entire lake or take a boat ride to the opposite side. This year (2015) the trail up to Inspiration Point is limited due to repair and relocation, but I understand you can still see the waterfall."
468,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,Georgia ,So beautiful! A Grand Teton requirement!,"Jenny Lake is truly breathtaking. We visited via the Wyoming Guide Company. To get the maximum experience take the boat across the lake to see the falls. If your take the ferry across, then you need to add 2 hours to your time allotted. The water of Jenny Lake is a blue as a fall sky!"
469,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015,not available, ,Lovely hike,"Jenny lake is an absolutely gorgeous lake! We took a 2 mile hike to the other side and saw the waterfall and took the boat back for $9 a person, which was well worth it. I highly recommend this hike!"
470,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Dripping Springs, TX ",Beautiful lake in the mountains,"We visited Jenny Lake in June 2015. The setting is beautiful with the mountains rising directly behind the lake. We started from the String Lake trailhead and hiked along the edge of the lake for a long distance before climbing up to Inspiration Point and Cascade Canyon. In one section of the String Lake trail, there are a bunch of dead trees and we go a close up view of a couple of Ospreys with a nest on top of one of the tree trunks. It was a great experience."
471,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Minneapolis, MN ",Take the Hidden Falls Hike,We took the Hidden Falls hike with a park ranger. It was a wonderful experience for our kids! We had to get up early to get to the visitor center in order to get a spot (they only take 25 each morning) but it was worth it. You do need to pay to take the boat across the lake for the hike but it was a great experience for our family.
472,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2014 , Friends,"Huntsville, UT ",Jenny Lake is beautiful,Hiking canoeing and enjoy the beauty! Short or long hikes and you can do somethings for free. There is a store with food and gifts. Not sure about wheel chair access or other things like that but we enjoyed it.
473,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Bridgeport, WV ",Beautiful place,This is a beautiful mountain lake with lovely wild flowers and many wild animals around it. Fishing and boating may be available but I didn't check into any of those type of activities
474,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family, ,Loved it,"I felt so at home here, the manager is very friendly and informative, you cannot beat the location near Jenny lake and the view. The whole way to get a campsite is kind of crazy, but once we figured it out, you have to scope out the whole thing and then see when a site is available, submit your paperwork by 730 am. It is a risk but I think it probably works out fine. Colter Bay is a larger wooded one that might be a good back up. I wish you could reserve online, but this is truly one of the best places I have ever camped. The bathrooms are a little bit of a haul, so it's definitely some extra work camping here, but well worth the location and view. Extremely beautiful."
475,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Cleveland, OH ",Simply gorgeous,So beautiful and serene! We stopped to take photographs and had great conversation with friendly people.
476,Jenny_Lake,Apr 2015 , Family,"Chandler, AZ ",Superb spot,Lovely lake inside the park. Numerous great campsites. Stunning views across the lake of the Tetons. Plenty of hikes available for all skill levels. Actually had a moose trek through our campsite on the last visit.
477,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family, ,Stunning,"Beautiful views, great hikes, nice boat ride across the lake. Be sure to go early in the morning to beat the crowds! No place better to have a picnic."
478,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Zionsville, IN ",Very popular spot in Grand Teton National Park!,"Very popular spot in Grand Teton National Park. A major trailhead, a visitors center, an information center, a store, and a ranger station. All that said - the lake is very beautiful - very clear snowmelt fed water surrounded by beautiful scenery. Great place to start a hike either back into the mountains or up to Inspiration Point or Hidden Falls. Also - nice place to canoe or kayak for an hour or two - and the rates seem reasonable.    If needed, be sure to stop by the ranger station for information before hiking. We were unsure regarding snow on the trail for a planned hike (June) up to Lake Solitude and the ranger was very helpful and reassuring. The guide in the visitor center even showed me how to use bear spray and the proper way to hold the canister! The rangers were also helpful with regards to the potential weather."
479,Jenny_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Buffalo, NY ",Jenny lake is the best!,"Jenny lake is so beautiful! The lake is small but the water is so clean and with the surrounding of snow mountains it looks more special. If you do not have much time to spend in Grand Teton, make Jenny lake a must-see!"
480,Jenny_Lake,Aug 2014 , Family, ,The trip coming up on July 14th will be my 7th trip to Grand Teton.,"The Jenny Lake area is superb. By now I am too old to hike the area around the lake I have done the ferry across the lake to the walk to Hidden Falls. I sure hope I can still handle it again this time. At my age this will probably be my last time to come out to visit the area my late husband and I loved so very much. I will be acting as 'Tour Guide' for my son & daughter in law and my 21 yr old granddaughter. Something tells me that they will love Grand Teton and Yellowstone and Jackson as much as I do. Best time to see Moose is around Oxbow Bend at dusk/sunset. At least that was the way it used to be the other times I've been there Luv the Catholic Chapel overlooking Jackson Lake. Did the Wagon Train trip thru Grand Teton years ago. Fantastic. Food was marvelous and the entertainment by the story teller nightly was just fine. The area further down that only gives recent dates for prior visit is required but the info I entered is not correct The choices didn't go back far enough. As I said the upcoming trip this July is my 7th trip back there. If you only have time for one thing, make it the Jenny Lake ferry to the walk to Hidden Falls."
481,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,London ,Boat tour and hike were great!,"Boat tour was good and easy to find/get tickets etc.  Hike to the Falls was good - if you've got the energy/fitness - go all the way to the top. If not, it's still a great view at the bottom/bridge."
482,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Woodburn, OR ",Good energetic day hike,"We visited on our way to Yellowstone. This is a beautiful, pristine lake at the foot of the Grande Teton. There is an approximately 7.5 mile trail that follows the lake edge all the way around. If you are fit enough do take it. You will be rewarded with views of mountain, lake and wildlife, including moose. It is a well traveled trail but not altogether clear of fallen trees. If you tire or run out od time, you can catch the shuttle to take you back to the lodge and parking. Cost is $9.00 for the shuttle each day. If you decide to make this hike, plan on at least 3 hours. Bring water and snacks as there are none on the trail."
483,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family, ,Hidden Falls,"One of the most beautiful places on the earth is Jenny Lake at the base of the Teton Mountains. Make sure you take a boat across the lake and then hike up to Hidden Falls. It's a great family hike that kids can do, as well."
484,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Murray, Kentucky, United States ",One of the prettiest places in the Tetons!,"This was our favorite place to visit during our visit to the Grand Tetons and to Yellowstone. The views are breathtaking, and the family atmosphere was very much appreciated. We rented paddle boards at Dornans in Moose, WY, and then used them for the day at Jenny Lake. They do rent out paddle boards, canoes, and kayaks at Jenny Lake, but a fellow vacationer recommended Dornans, and we found the best value there. There are plenty of places to enter the lake and many places to rest or have a picnic. The Rangers were very visible and helpful, and we felt very safe there. We also enjoyed hiking at Jenny Lake, and if you get tired or just want a chance of pace, you can take a boat ride back across the lake to the visitors center. It was $9 per person, one way. The general store at Jenny Lake has better prices on snacks and soft drinks than any other store/gift shop we encountered in the Grand Tetons and in Yellowstone. Stock up there! The people who work there are fantastic and incredibly helpful. We encountered so many hikers, mountain climbers, and water enthusiasts, and everyone seemed to be enjoying Jenny Lake immensely. It's worth a visit!!!"
485,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Titusville, ",Crowded in mid-week,"There were cars everywhere, even parked along the red line ""no parking"" area, so patience as we drove around a few times and found a spot. The boat tours were filled to capacity and on schedule. The hiking trail is easy around the lake and the view of the mountain behind the lake is a photo opportunity; unfortunately, with the boat and light wind no reflection of the mountain. As we entered the area, an elk sporting a full rack was laying under a tree and people were lined up to to take his picture. I suspect this place will continue to be busy. Hint: For the best picture of the lake and mountain try early morning or early evening after the boat tours end."
486,Jenny_Lake,May 2015 , Couples,"Miami, FL ",Located at the base of the snow covered Tetons,"Any where else this would just be another lake but Jenny Lake is situated at the base of the snow covered Grand Tetons which makes it very special. Take a look. Grand Teton N.P is quite small and you should take some time to see Jenny Lake. If you have time and are not traveling with a pet, take the boat ride which we wish we had been able to do."
487,Jenny_Lake,May 2015 , Couples,"Jersey Shore, New Jersey ",Vacation at Grand Teton NP,"The view of the mountains, lakes and open spaces was beautiful. Plenty of large wildlife to view. The Park was laid out very well. The town of Jackson, WY was only about 45 minutes away and is a must see."
488,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Priceville, Alabama ",Beautiful area for hiking,"Whether you take the ferry to inspiration point and the hidden fall trails, or choose to meander the trail around the lake, you will have beautiful views. This is a good place to stop for a hike in the Grand Teton National Park."
489,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Raleigh, North Carolina ",day trip from Yellowstone,"If you are staying @ Yellowstone you can drive up (from West Yellowstone, Montana 2.5 hr drive) to Jenny Lake for a day trip. Jenny Lake is actually located within Grant Tetons Nat Park, but the way it works you won't have to pay entry into the park as long as you don't drive further north. If you are planning to visit both park: Yellowstone & the Tetons you'll get a discount on one admission ticket. You can't however purchase one ticket for both parks. So, if you already purchased Yellowstone ticket ($30 per car for a 7 day stay, which is an incredible bargain by any standards) show that to the Tetons ticket booth & you will pay only $20 entry fee.  Parking at the lake is a bit of a headache so come early. Drive up all the way to ranger station/info where the boat landing is located. For those who want to take a trail around the park expect at least 8 hrs of hiking and walking. You can split that in half by taking one way boat ride ($9 per person) and then walk back, or you can buy round trip ticket $15 per person ($!2 for 60 yr old &up).We decided on RT so we could have enough energy to take on 2 trails around the beautiful waterfall. You can start with the longer trek up the hill-1.6 mile. However, the Hidden Falls trail is more rewarding & the views of the waterfall more beautiful.  Also, as you leave the boat dock (last loading to return to rangers station is @ 7 pm) look down into the water & you will see trout & other fish feeding on bugs."
490,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Friends,Fort Lauderdale ,Popular but Beautiful,"Jenny Lake is very popular and crowded compared to other areas. With that said, it is very beautiful, easy walking trails and great views. I would recommend seeing Hidden Falls versus Inspiration Point."
491,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015,not available,"Fishers, IN ",A lovely mountain lake,"We toured this lake while visiting the Grand Tetons. There is a long scenic drive which takes you beside the lake. I would have given this 5 stars, but portions of the trail were being rebuilt. Check out the touching, sad tale about the Jenny the lake is named after."
492,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Hollywood, FL ",Great outing for the Family,Stopped in at Jenny Lake while on vacation. So glad we took the boat shuttle over to the other side of the lake to check out the waterfalls.    Fantastic views! A definite must see while in Jackson.
493,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Sun City, AZ ",Beautiful mountain view!,The boat ride across the lake provided a breathtaking view of the mountains. We then hiked up to Hidden Falls which was beautiful.
494,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Montbello, CO ",beautiful Lake with walking trails all around it,This is a small lake and the walking trails go around the lake. The south side has fun bridges that cross the creeks and it was great for photos of the Tetons. Trail is relatively flat and in the evening offers a great place to take sunset photos.
495,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",lovely hike,"If you hike to the waterfall and then take the boat back, it's about 2.5 hours total. Also, if you only take the boat one way, it's less money."
496,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,Memphis ,Nice Area,"It was a nice area. We just walked around, had lunch and drove on to other areas in The Grand Tetons."
497,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Houston, Texas, ",early light is gorgeous,"The road to the lake gets busy, the turnouts crowded, so a morning visit gets you beautiful light on the mountains and maybe a head start on the crowds. We went morning and afternoons, however, and always enjoyed the views. A beautiful place for hike and photography."
498,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Wonderful Family Trip,"I traveled with my husband and two older children and we had an absolutely wonderful time!!! We stayed at the Signal Mountain Lodge and I do not have any bad things to say. It was wonderful, the Lodge was great; the food was excellent; the staff were always pleasant; and our room was just recently updated so it was great!"
499,Jenny_Lake,Jun 2015 , Friends,"Fort Worth, TX ",Great hike,I took the ferry over and hiked up to inspiration point. It was beautiful. I recommend the hike. It wasn't easy for a non hiker but I did it. Get there early.... It gets crowded.
