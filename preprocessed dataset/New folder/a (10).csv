0,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2022,not available, ,No sight-seeing in winter - ski lift only,"The gondola ride to the top of the mountain does not have a 'sight seeing' ticket during the winter months. The company wants you to pay the 200.00 daily rate for lift tickets, skier or not. This is not explained anywhere if you have scheduled reservations at the mountaintop restaurant."
1,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2021,not available,"New York City, NY ",Great experience and views,Fun afternoon taking the tram to the top of the mountain-nice place to sit when you reach the top to enjoy the beauty of Jackson Hole.
2,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Jacksonville, FL ","Great Ride, Beautiful Views","Took the tram to the top and loved seeing the changing fall leaves on the mountain! It was not crowded so we didn’t have to wait in a line. Unfortunately, the season for this tram is nearing an end but they do have other lifts up the mountain which should be running soon. A little cafe is located at the top, so we grabbed a beer and sat outside and drank in the scenery! Book on line to save money!"
3,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2021,not available,Indianapolis ,Great Pace for a Photo!,The tram rice is a bit expensive but the scenery from the top is worth the price of admission! There is a nice place to sit and view the town and mountains at the peak. Even with a bit of smoke haze it was still beautiful.
4,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2021,not available,"Dallas, TX ",Once,"Expansive ride, there are 3 lines open at the time. 2 are gondolas, the other open is an open ski lift. Plenty of mountain bikers. $45 ticket, ideally, u can rider repeated all day. Took the one ride to the top of the mountain, view is nice. No sure if we would do it again"

6,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2021 , Friends,"Denver, CO ",Drove 30 minutes for nothing,The ticket taker was incredibly rude. I have been on the gondola ride numerous times but today $ 45.00 per person not free. It is beautiful at the top and was one of my favorite things to do. A great cocktail and food.
7,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2021,not available,"Knoxville, TN ",view is divine,we took the tram to the top of the mountain one day & loved the view...it was still somewhat smoky from a close fire...but the ride & lunch was fun!
8,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2021,not available,"Grand Rapids, MI ",Great views...expensive ride,"The view is fantastic but it cost us also $90 to appreciate it. They need to provide for a discount if you have lunch up there which we did. Between the cost of the gondola ride and expensive food, the totals was more than having dinner at an great restaurant."
9,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2021,not available, ,Amazing views!!,Views were breathtaking and waffles at the top was amazing. The main tram was closed for maintenance but the smaller one was just as fun! TIP: if you buy tickets online you get a discount verses buying at the ticket window.
10,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2021,not available,"Denver, CO ",Amazing views from the top!,"Tram ride was great and incredible views from the top. Unfortunately with COVID putting tram capacity at 25%, there was an hour wait both times we took it. No way to help this though and glad they are taking safety precautions."
11,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2020,not available,"Nashville, TN ",Great Views,"I took the tram up to the top of the mountain. It offers amazing views of Jackson Hole and the mountains surrounding it. I visited in June early in the morning b/c I had to drive back to Yellowstone, not too many people were around and no lines in getting on/off tram."
12,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2020,not available,"Valparaiso, IN, ",Go to the top of the mountain,The ride up the mountain was smooth and easy. The top of the mountain was fantastic. you get amazing views. There are some trails you can walk up to higher on the mountain and don't need any special kit for. There is a lovely restaurant and restrooms. The patio area was fantastic.
13,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2020 , Family,"Lafayette, IN ",A must do,"My family visited the tram this week. With ages varying from 13-63 we all enjoyed ourselves. There was virtually no wait for the tram, they were clean, we felt safe and the views were great. We did some hiking once we reached the top as well. The cafe offered amazing smelling waffles but we had just eaten so we did not partake. We were hoping to have a cocktail but the selection was very limited. We purchased our tickets on line ahead of time."
14,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Plant City, FL, ","Gorgeous, especially after 5 for free!",Loved the scenery and the Deck at the top. So fun to walk around the mountain too for a bit. Fabulous photo opportunities!

17,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2020,not available,"North Salt Lake, UT ","""What A View!""","The tram is open! We got a family pass ($99) which was the cheapest price. That gave us unlimited rides up/down. Free rides start at 5pm, but we arrived at 10:30. Smooth quick, scenic ride up and a fantastic view. The restaurant is grab & go now - waffles, pizza, ready-made sandwiches along with drinks including beer & wine. We just ate outside taking in the sun and view. There's lots of activities to partake in - hiking, biking, shopping, etc. Teton Village area is worth a visit!"
18,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2020,not available,"Midland, TX ",Get on this ride!,"I remember when they put the tram in, and it changed the whole mountain. This is reserved for the best snow days!!! I love coming back here!"
19,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2020,not available,"Louisville, KY ",Great Scenery,The trip up is worth it. You can sit up there and have lunch or drinks and just relax. Breath taking views.
20,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2020 , Family,"Laurel, MD ",So fun!,"Went to the top for happy hour. Line Up early! Free rides start at 5. Line forms around 4:30. About a 12 min ride up. Walk around enjoy the views and grab a cocktail or beer or snack. 8 people to a car. Line to come down is a shorter wait. Or if you’re fit, hike up and grab a ride down! A must do in The Teton Village in the summer!!!"
21,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2020 , Family,"East Brunswick, NJ ",Loved it!,"It's free after 5 pm, but we were glad to purchase a bit overpriced tickets. At 4:30 pm the free ride line started to grow by the minute. Not a big deal if you have time to kill, but we had too much to see/do to waste any of it waiting in line. The gondola was clean having one family per unit made the experience so much more enjoyable. My 8 y.o. was a little scared at first, but got over his fear withing the first minute of the ride. Great experience!"
22,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"Houston, TX ",Great views and a good starting point for various hikes,The views from the top are amazing. We were lucky to be close to a window on the way up so we could enjoy the views all the way to the top. The top station is the starting point for many hikes ranging from easy mostly downhill hikes to summit hikes or multi hour strenuous ones. Beautiful scenery!
23,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2020,not available,"Everett, WA ",Great Hike Wildflower Trail,"Great Hike, was a beautiful sunny summery day, found a place to park right away, free!!, and I spent hours in Teton Village, great place, great exercise."
24,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2020,not available,"San Diego, CA ",Worth the ride up,The views are just breathtaking. Make sure you do this on your stay to Teton Village. Very worth it!
25,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2020,not available,"Mays Landing, NJ ",On top of the world,What a fantastic view. you could see the valley. The tram ride was short and sweet. We spend about 1 hour taking in the sites
26,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2020,not available,"Mill Valley, CA ","The line was too long, and the ride was too cramped with the crowd","We decided to ski from the very top, and so the only way to get there was the tram. I regret that choice as the line was an hour long and they packed us in like sardines. The ride was standing room only and holding onto our skis. Not pleasant by any stretch of the imagination. Still the view at the top was spectacular and my friends all enjoyed their waffles"
27,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2019,not available,"Santa Barbara, CA ",A fun ride up and down,"The tram is a great way to see to entire are winters, spring summer or fall. Amazing views of Tetons and the tram brings you up to 10500 +feet. There are a few weeks the it is closed."
28,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2020,not available, ,Amazing views!,"Truly a marvel of engineering. The waits can get crazy in the mornings,especially if they got snow the night before. It was a little scary when we had 30 mph winds one day but it was reassuring knowing it was designed to take up to 60mph winds..."
29,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2020 , Couples,"Cambridge, Wisconsin ",Must do!,"It is so worth the price.    The ride up is crammed with all the skiers .. but the ride down is amazing... and the tram is basically empty.    Yes, eat a waffle on the top of the hill. The brown sugar waffle is unbelievable. The restaurant up there is tiny so be OK standing."
30,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2020,not available,"O'Neill, NE ",Amazing view!,"They pack in a ton of people on the tram so the you will likely not get great views on the way up. However, if you aren't skiing down, you'll likely be one of few people that ride it back down so you can get great views then. The view from the top is priceless! It's worth waiting for a clear day to go though! Be sure to get a waffle when you get to the top! :)"
31,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"North Vernon, IN ",campfieldvacation 2019,We went up on the tram. It was a little windy but the ride and view were beautiful. The wait wasn't bad to ride the tram. The restaurants weren't open when we went up there
32,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Boston, MA ",The only way I would get to the top of this mountain.....,"Staggeringly beautiful views; great hiking trails that are well marked, and a great opportunity to spot a few moose."
33,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2019,not available,"Lehigh Acres, FL ",Indulge in This Oblectament (a source of delight),"If you are a philocalist (a lover of beautiful things) this experience is a must! If you are wondering, I had to look up these words to more precisely depict and encapsulate the wonder and beauty of this mountaintop experience. The tram ascends 10,000 feet up the Teton Mountain Range and the views below are breathtaking-deer grazing, birds soaring above and stately trees declaring their majestic presence. If that is not scenic enough, when you arrive at the top you are rendered speechless by the sheer beauty of nature, and all its perfections, as it engulfs you. The snowcapped mountains literally glister and glisten in the sunlight, like a million diamonds scattered about. If you walk a bit down the path, away from the tram, the silence of the mountaintop is serene. I am not a writer, so I cannot do this experience justice, you will just have to see it for yourself-which I urge you to do.  p.s. It’s cold! So be sure you bundled up. My husband and I went in October and the temperature was about 20 degrees at the top of the mountain; We are from Florida so that feels cold for us. Luckily, there is a small eatery at the top that serves hot beverages: coffee, cocoa, hot cider and homemade waffles with different toppings. My husband had a cider and I sipped at my cocoa as we warmed up and continued to take in the grandeur of the view around us."
34,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Ashland, AL ",Great views!,"We tried to book this ride on line but had issues with connection. We mentioned this to the man who was accepting the money and he said they were having computer problems, but he would be glad to help us so we could get the discount. When my friend asked about a military discount, he assured us that they did offer this and it would be a better discount than the one on line. He then thanked my friend for his service to our country. I wish I had asked this gentlemen's name because he is a great addition to his job. The Tram goes up 10,000 feet and the view is wonderful. There is a pancake house at the top but we did not eat there. There was snow at the top of the mountain."
35,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2019,not available,"Shreveport, LA ","THE TRAM, BEST VIEW IN THE VALLEY","The view from the tram is good any season! Definitely worth the time and effort. There's a great hike from the top, down Granite Canyon trail, over the back side. About 12 miles and beautiful in spring and summer.  Also, a hike down into Cody Bowl is stimulating and beautiful. Kids will like it. Dress warm."
36,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Couples, ,Teton Tram,"Exciting visit to the top of a Grand Teton mountain. Altitude 10,400 ft.  Great views from the top as well as  during the ascent on the comfortable  tram."
37,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Columbus, OH ",Loved the ride and where it took us,We took the tram and it was offseason so we had no wait. The tram itself was comfortable and the views going up and down were awesome. Once to the top we hiked. It was 37 and we were at 10450 ft. trails were very nice and we fully enjoyed ourself. It is worth the cost.
38,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2019,not available,"Peachtree City, GA ",Gotta do this in Jackson,I've skied many times so I thought the tram would be just OK. It was better than OK-we spent several hours on the mountain even though it was 20 degrees and there was a foot and a half of snow and our clothes weren't suitable. We kept going in Corbett's Cabin and warming up then admiring the views over and over. Online ticket saves you a few bucks.
39,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2019 , Couples,"Abingdon, VA ",Fabulous Views,"Enjoyed riding tram to top of mountain so much! The views were spectacular! The ride was very smooth, not scary at all! It was pretty chilly up there in October, but seeing the snow was so exciting. We also enjoyed the waffles in Corbets Cabin..yummy. Spent an hour or so and headed back down. We got there just in time because it was closing day after we were there..until busy season. So glad we did this. Would definitely do it again! Great experience."
40,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Melbourne Beach, FL ",Snow country,The tram and gondola rides are awesome. Leaving 6000 feet you ascend to over 10000 feet where the snow comes into the tram. You can exit the top for waffles and hot chocolate. A tram comes every 15 minutes.    They offer many discounts including online ones. Good for all ages.
41,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Rock Springs, WY ",Fantastic views,The “Hole” is completely visible from approximately 4100’ above the valley floor. And Corbett’s Cabin on top serves excellent waffles. Have them topped with peanut butter and BACON! you’ll be back!
42,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Richmond, VA ",Magnificent!,"This is an awesome way to get to the top of Rendevous Mountain and to see the beauty and majesty of Jackson, the Tetons, and surrounding mountain ranges. The weather changes dramatically. When we got to the top, quite a bit of snow had fallen. Fortunately, we were dressed properly."
43,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,Dubai ,rip-off,40 USd per person is way too high for even to be bothered... we hiked so much nicer areas in grand teton just driving a little...
44,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,Missouri ,Jackson Hole Aerial Tram to the top of Mt. Rendezvous,"We were staying in Jackson, WY while touring Yellowstone & had some time one morning to visit the ski village, Teton Village. A beautiful area with ski shops, clothing shops, restaurants, hotel rooms, and ski lifts. If you want to ride to the top of the mountain, buy your tickets online before you arrive. Online adult price is $35, but if you wait until you arrive they are $42. Once you check in at the tram gate, you are given a lift pass / wristband. That gets you up the tram to the top of Mt. Rendezvous, and up the gondola about the lower, adjoining mountain. The tram holds about 75 people and runs every 15 minutes. The gondolas run continuously and hold 6 or so. If you take the tram, go early & avoid the classes of kids that we saw on our way down the mountain around 10:30am. The other advantage of going early is you can get fresh-baked waffles made to order - and hot coffee - in the small cabin restaurant on the top. It was a lot of fun, going to 10,500 feet from about 6,000 feet, and having a snowball fight up top. If you go ahead & take the gondola later, included in your lift ticket price, you can go to the top of the adjacent mountain, which is not as tall as Mt. Rendezvous - and not nearly as cold at top. There is a nicer, and much larger, restaurant there, and a great concrete veranda to sit and look down on the valley. Right now they have construction and construction fencing going on at the edge of the veranda, but it did not obstruct our view."
45,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Springdale, AR ",GO!!!!,"Stunning experience! Love it! The views are AMAZING! Wish we had planned to hike down but even if you just ride up and down, it is worth the trip!"
46,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Couples, ,Tetons,I’m a little nervous of heights but the tram felt safe. The view from the top was great. It was pretty close to Jackson Hole.
47,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Gold Coast, Australia ",A must place to visit,"Even if you are only in Jackson a few days, take the local bus for $3 up to Teton Village and pay $37 for the tram ride which goes right up to the top and also includes the gondola ride which we actually found more fun as not so crowded. The views from the top are magnificent."
48,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Family, ,Great views. Fun for kids,Getting to the top of the mountain without a climb :-). Views were great. Only downside was cost. A little pricey Waffles at the top were the bonus
49,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Friends,"McKinney, TX ",Fun—But Go Early,"I took my group of 16 retreaters for an early-morning ride on the tram. We arrived about 9:30–and we were so glad we did. There were no lines for the ride up-or down-and more importantly, no wait for the waffles! By the time we started down, there were LONG lines for both.    Extra special—we saw two moose on the way down!    The view is beautiful. It’s one more way to view and enjoy the Tetons."
50,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",Gateway to a spectacular view and good waffles,"Kept hearing how you had to go up the mountain to experience the view and we finally went. Remember it’s colder up there. The guides pointed out wildlife on the way up we saw moose and elk. It was a pleasant ride we went in September so the only snow to be found was in the mountain when we went up. Had waffles and bacon at the summit, you can take a small one mile hike to the gondola or if the altitude isn’t an issue it’s a trek to the bottom. Your money gets you a whole day pass for ups and down the tram."
51,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Los Angeles, CA ",Amazing Views!,"This is a must see when you are in Jackson Hole. The ride up and down is amazing, so many different views of the entire Teton Village. The operators are very helpful. professional and know their stuff."
52,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Cedarburg, WI, United States ",Trip with my mom,"We throughly loved the Aerial Tram, the waffles, and hot chocolate. It was cold and snowy up top. We were pleasantly surprised to learn when we got back down that we could also do the Brigerd gondola as well. We jumped onto that and went up 2/3rds of the way to the top. It was lovely there and had comfortable seating on the deck overlooking the valley. Mom enjoyed her decaf coffee at the lower level. Very nice experience! Go early, before the tour buses drop their patrons. Shorter lines or no lines. 😀"

56,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,East Bethel ,Worth the money,"Good views on the way up and down, and a 360 degree view from the top. Very smooth ride, feels very safe. You need to be prepared for the temp change up top, we were stuck up there for an hour while a thunderstorm rolled through the area and it snowed about a half inch on top. Small chalet up top has good waffles and a gift shop."
57,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Cannon Falls, MN ",Fantastic Views!,"The views were tremendous and worth the price. The two tram operators we had were informative, personable and lots of fun. A great experience"
58,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available, ,Jackson Hole Aerial Tram,Rode the tram up to a private gathering at restaurant on top....great views! Food wasn't at its best from others who have dined here before.
59,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Best Waffles EVER!!!,"The views are absolutely amazing. Nice weather when we started and by the time we got to the top it was snowing and windy, with several inches of snow on the ground. The waffles at the shop were the best that I have ever had. We also saw a big, bull moose on the ride up and the on the way down. The tram is pretty expensive, but the views and waffles are worth it."
60,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Westborough, MA ","10,450 feet of altitude!!",This is certainly worth the cost of the tram ride. It's beautiful up there and the views of Jackson and the Tetons are great. We didn't try the little restaurant because we weren't hungry and the timing wasn't good for eating.
61,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available, ,Amazing!,The tram ride is a must do! The scenery is awesome and the view of the Grand Teton are breath taking!
62,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Bossier City, LA ",The tram is a great way to get to the top........,"but the best part of the ride is knowing you get to hike down the mountain if you want to give it a go. There are some really nice views from the top, plenty of trails to choose from, and a real sense of accomplishment after you get down the mountain. I do have one question if anyone can answer it. Why no syrup for the waffles?"
63,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Edmond, OK ",Tram and Gondola Ride,"Great rides from both. Beautiful views. Easy on and off. Wear a coat, dress warm. IIt can get cold at 10,000 plus feet."
64,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available, ,Fabulous Views,The tram ride at Jackson Hole should certainly be a part of everyone’s visit! You get such excellent views of the ski area and the whole valley. It’s beautiful here even without snow!
65,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Family,"Asheville, NC ",Spectacular views,"Our family loved the tram ride, even my teenage son who is afraid of heights and won’t ride ANYTHING! The ride is smooth and takes about 8 minutes to ascend to the top, which gives you time to take in the scenery. We saw several moose on the way down!! I recommend going on a clear day to take full advantage of the vistas and go early so you can ride several times. There’s a great cafe with fresh waffles, warm drinks for the kids and adult beverages. Take a coat because it’s 15-20 degrees cooler at the top with strong winds and bring a fat wallet because it’s an expensive experience. It cost our family $135 to ride the tram and have have hot chocolate."
66,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Delray Beach, FL ",Don't miss a ride.,"It's too expensive - wait till after 5:00pm when it's free!! The view is lovely. Really crowded at the top, and it was off season."
67,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Couples,United States ,Make sure to go after 5,We talked with some of the locals and found out the tram is free after 5pm. Definitely worth the ride.... but the restaurant is a little pricey inside. I recommend setting outside and enjoy the view while eating off the outside menu. This one pretty much consists of appetizers.
68,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Albuquerque, NM ",Nice views on the way up and at the top,"Nice trip up the mountain. When we got to the top it was super windy. Not much to do during non-ski-season except admire the view and go back down again. There is a restaurant with burgers, etc., but didn't try it. Spent less than 15 min at the top, returned to tram in time to catch the next one down."
69,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Huntington Beach, CA ",Good For The View,"It takes 12 minutes and during that time the attendant gives a background of the Grand Tetons. We saw moose on our trip, but bears can be seen too. The tram has a few seats with most travelers standing. If you go with kids it may be a challenge as there are no low handholds. The top of the mountain at 10,400 feet can be windy and cold so dress appropriately."
70,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019,not available,"Anaheim, CA ",Expensive,"We did enjoy the 10,000 foot view, but you pay the price. We went up in late morning and tried the waffles, that were just ok. I would say if you are a hiker, then you would probably find it’s worth it as you can take some trails from there The views are amazing. We later had dinner at other location on mountain (about8000 feet) and that gondola is free after 5 there. Also the price is for an all day pass to both gondolas if you do decide to go."
71,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Warner Springs, CA ",The Tram,"If you get a chance, take the Jackson Hole Arial Tram.

75,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"Lewes, Delaware, United States ",Great Views from the Top,Beautiful views up the mountain and from the top. It was cold and windy at the top so make sure you have a jacket.  There is a waffle house which is good at the top but we didn't eat there. It was worth the experience since we aren't climbers and when can you go to the top of the Tetons?
76,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available, ,Beautiful view,This experience was awesome. It was a little expensive but I would do it again. It really is a must for a visit to Teton Village.

78,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"Elkview, WV ",Great Views!,"The aerial tram is expensive and you can take the gondola in the evening for free. However, we enjoyed the experience. The tram is not scary but the view from the top is! Not sure what possesses people to ski down from there in winter. Beautiful views."
79,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2019 , Family,"Denver, CO ",It was cool but expensive,"We are from Colorado and frequent the mountains monthly. I thought the Tram would be neat because it is better than climbing it with 4 small kids for sure, but it was slightly lackluster. There are so many awesome things to do in Teton village and this was our least favorite for the most money spent. It does provide you with some great views though."

82,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Couples, ,Must do,We hiked down and caught the tram down it was so much fun. Amazing views. Relaxing. I highly recommend riding all three.
83,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"Jackson, WY ",See the Snake river Valley,"A great way to experience the Tetons, by riding up the Aerial Tram. Wonderful views of teh valley, some great hiking at the top, and a chance to see some wildlife on the way up or down."
84,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Family,"Syracuse, NY ",Amazing views!,We took the Jackson Hole tram to the top of Rendezvous mountain for great views and the famous Waffle House Corbets Cabin. We saved by booking online and were able to get a seat in the front of the Tram on the way up. After exiting at the top we could see the valley below and the glacier packed mountains toward Idaho. Our waffles were excellent and highly recommended. The Tram comes every 15 minutes since there are two cars one going up and another down on the same cable system. Don’t miss this ride!
85,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Couples, ,To the top!,"Terrified of heights, however this tram ride is relatively smooth. Saw a female Moose on the ride up and down ❤️."
86,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,Chico ,Waffles!,ADA accessible but put on your nobby wheels. Great waffles and view. helpful staff and an elevator to the tram entrance.
87,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Family, ,Gorgeous views,The aerial tram is really a lot of fun. The operators are funny and entertaining. They play a recording to give you some insight into the area and the tram. The views from the top are unparalleled. The tram pass will allow you to travel up the mountain on three different lifts in the summer.    There is a restaurant for snacks and drinks at the top. There are also restrooms. Our family didn’t last long up there. The quick climb in altitude took a bit of a toll. We had to venture back down the mountain rather quickly as we weren’t feeling too well.    Highly recommend this excursion for unmatched views of Jackson Hole and access to hiking trails.
88,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"Charlotte, NC ",Do not miss!!,"Fantastic ride to the top- just the engineering of the tram is amazing, but then the view!!!! Really great trip to the top. We hiked Cirque Trail to the gondola down. Stunning views- went theough rocky areas, forest, and everything in between in just 1.8 miles. Then, of course we had to try the chair lift since it's all included! Great day!"
89,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"Izmir, Turkey ",Great Vistas!,At $45 per person a bit pricey but a great ride up and beautiful views as you get on the top. Remember you're going UP so bring a jacket as even in the middle of August it was under 50 degrees. Some great hikes and waffles up there too.
90,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available, ,Unreal views,"Must do, if you are in the area. The views are amazing and the ride is fun. It is a big tram, fits 60-100 people (although not enough seats for that many). Those with a fear of heights do not need to worry - feels very secure, does not sway like a ski lift and up top is wide and spacious. Does not feel like you can fall off a cliff, as the top feature a gradual slope. The views are amazing. Worth the price (but not cheap)."
91,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019,not available,"Parsons, KS ",Amazing View!,"We rode the tram up to the top and the view was so amazing and beautiful. After 5:00 it is free and that is when we went. If you are in this area, it is a must things to do for sure."
92,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Friends,"Hooksett, New Hampshire, United States ",Extraordinary Views,The views from the top of Rendezvous Mountain are breathtaking! A must do if you are in the area. Pictures do not do justice to the feeling of seeing the Grand Tetons and the valleys below. We will never forget this experience!
93,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019,not available,"Chicago, IL ","Great views, costs too much","At $45/adult ($38 if you buy online), it's way over priced if you are just riding up for the view. The tram is fairly roomy but there are only seats for about 10 people. Everyone else needs to stand and hold onto a little strap. If you get motion sick, this probably isn't an activity for you unless you take a Dramamine. Once at the top, the views are great but there are even better views in the GTNP. We walked around and took photos. Had I known better, I would have planned a longer hike at the top - that could at least justify the cost."
94,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Family,"South Bend, IN ",Very disappointed,If going in the ski season the lift is needed. For the summer this was the most over priced activity I have ever done. $120 for a family of 4 to a look out point and that was it. Would not recommend it.
95,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019,not available,"Kearny, NJ ",A must -do!,"What a fun thing to do while in Jackson! Bought tickets online , definitely take advantage of the discount. The tram ride was amazing, smooth and spectacular views all around! Our family hiked on the many trails that were clearly marked and enjoyed our first views of the Tetons! We didn't have to wait long for the ride back down, a great experience all around. Highly recommend!"
96,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Ride Up — Walk Down,"Great way to get to 10,000 ft for a nice walk down on the summer road. Walking with kids 7, 10, 12 plus a couple seniors makes the summer road a good choice. Fabulous views from top and great scenery and wildlife sightings (elk, mule deer, marmot and pica) on walk down."
97,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019,not available,"Evansville, WI ","Easy experience, smooth ride","Definitely take the time to experience this smooth tram ride to a spectacular view of the mountain range. In about 12 minutes, you'll glide 4,000-some feet to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. I didn't dine on the gourmet waffles at the summit but the aroma was delicious. Be sure to book tickets online for a nice discount."
98,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"Tucson, AZ ",Spectacular but pricey!,"Fabulous views on your ride up, down and on the mountain. Also, must add, lunch is pretty inexpensive! Truthfully the sum of the costs of the tram ride plus lunch was pretty close to the cost of lunch only in Carmel CA. Also, if you’re willing to wait until 5pm you can ride for free. Definitely worth the expense for me!"
99,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family, ,"Very cool, but pricey","The tram is exactly what you read it will be, it takes you to the top for some magnificent views and back down. It was spectacular to be at the top but the price of the ticket is expensive. We are at Corbett’s Cabin, that was a fun experience as well. In our opinion, it was worth the money, but for others with a tighter budget it might not be worth the expense."
100,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Bundaberg, Australia ",Tram ride,Excellent old fashion diesel tram ride through wonderful forest of 100m trees. Travel over wooden trestle bridges with ongoing personal commentary. Bit cool but refreshing.
101,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,"St. Paul, United States ",Tram and Gondola Accessibility,"This the Jackson Hole Tram if you try to search it online. It is located in the Teton Village. The one thing I didn't realize is the high ticket price you pay is good for 3 different rides - and they are good all day! The tram is the one most people go for it takes you 10, 450 feet up and there are waffles to buy at the top for $8 each. I have to say they are good. For those with wheelchair accessibility needs you can get on the tram easily. Once on top we found my son could move around. We had to stop some people so we could move doors a certain way to get him inside the waffle shop but we made it in. He did make it to the top of the mountain also but it is a little steep. He usually goes down backwards in this powerchair with one of us guiding him. The little waffle house at top is not completely accessible on the outside of it. Then once you head down we went over to the Gondola ride. Probably should have done that first because it is not as far up. It IS wheelchair accessible. They will stop the ride and bring out a ramp for you and the seats on the side can fold up. We still got 3 of us in there. Then when you get up top they will ask if you want out and stop it again. There is a small cafe up there and I hear at night they have a happy hour special. I also heard it is free to ride Gondola at night to restaurant, but after a certain time. When we were there it was booked for a private party so I don't know how that is. Cool views however. Your ride pass is then good for a 3 ride but wheelchair accessibility is a no go on that one. I would also buy your ticket ahead of time to save $7 each."
102,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,Avondale ,Trip to Summit for Waffles and Hiking,"The 12 minute trip to the summit (10,450 ft) was incredible and then started the day with waffles and then a 2 mile hike (Crique Trail) down to the mid mountain lifts was a great way to start the day!"
103,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Kids had blast,"We purchased a family package and spent time taking various trams up. The view was spectacular. With two little kids, this was the one of the best activities to engage the little ones. It was not cold during summer. Hoodies should be sufficient."
104,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019,not available, ,WAY too expensive,"We used the tram to cut off a large climb of our hike through Granite Canyon to accommodate my parents. While it is convenient, it is disturbingly overpriced. Prepare to pay $44 (or $37 if you buy online beforehand) for a fast-paced 12-minute ride up a mountain with not terribly much to see...from the Tram you barely can see the Grand Teton and mostly just view the valley and two peaks of the less spectacular southern part of range. For a ski resort on federally-owned National Forest land, I'm utterly shocked (and disappointed) by the price tag.    My suggestion: if you are able, take the walk up instead of the Tram or go on a flat walk through Grand Teton National Park with better views of the mountains.    One saving grace...the operators were friendly."
105,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Olympic Valley, CA ",Jackson Hole Tram,"I love this tram! An epic state of the art tram rising 4,000 feet into the Tetons! I live at Squaw Valley, and like our tram too, but it only goes 2,000 feet up the mountain. I have ridden the Snowbird tram as well, which goes up 2,900 feet. To my mind, the Jackson Hole tram is the most dramatic and sophisticated! For the price of admission, you can also access the nearby gondola which takes you up to a restaurant. I loved sitting mid-mountain and watching this mighty tram rip up the hillside at an amazing 12 minutes! This tram is terrific! And the Grand Tetons are extraordinary‼️"
106,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019,not available,"Henderson, NV, ",Tram To The Top,"Spendy ride just to get to the mountain top, which might be quite windy and definitely colder than at the base. If you want to take lots of photos and hike around, or even hike down, then OK. But just for a quick round trip, I wouldn't. Rather ride up the nearby gondola where you'll find better food choices and it's a less time consuming hike down from there."
107,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Harrison, AR ",Tram-tastic,"Yes, this is a tourist item. If you haven't ridden a tram you must, the ride is so smooth and peaceful. For most it is standing room only, since there are just a few seats. The day pass does allow you multiple rides on the tram, lift, gondola so use it as much as you can to justify the ticket/pp."
108,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Mill Hall, PA ",Fantastic!,Rode the tram up to Mt Rendezvous. Smooth travel both up and back. Ride totally worth the view!    Tram operator very friendly and would point out sites along the way.    Would go again in a split second! ♥️
109,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Stuart, FL ",Why would you not do this?,"We thought this would be fun. It is, in fact, stunning. The trip often lets you see a deer or even a bear and when you step out on top it is even more than you imagined. Do not miss it."
110,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Friends,"Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, ",Gorgeous!,"If you are not sure...just do it! It is a quick 12 minute ride each way, quite stable and beautiful views!"
111,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Coeur d'Alene, ID ",AMAZING - DO IT!,This was the highlight of our trip! The hubby and I did it last summer and we brought the kids this time - they loved it as well! The views are amazing - we even got to see a bear below us on our way down. The waffles at the lookout are delicious - we need the recipe! It is definitely worth the ticket price - just be sure to bring a jacket if it's even remotely cool at the base - it's freezing at the top!
112,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Friends, ,Top of the world,You absolutely feel like your on top of the world. we had waffles while overlooking Teton village. Being so high up took a little getting used to
113,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019 , Couples, ,Nice Visit,This is worth the cost to travel up the mountain. A great view and fun even not in ski season. Grab a bite at Piste or one of the cafes at the bottom of the mountain.
114,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2019,not available,Highland ,I cried,"This was one of the most awesome experiences. The greatness of the mountains surrounding the summit was breathtaking. I was so overwhelmed with the beauty I got emotional. Don’t ask my why, but the experience was unbelievable. I’ve been to a lot of places as we have traveled the USA in our fifth wheel and we’ve done and seen a lot. I highly recommend this for adults and kids alike."
115,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Must see this view!,This was so great! We got the family pass in the summer and rode all three lifts. Must do! Grab a waffle and a beer at the top. So great!

117,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Friends, ,A bit expensive but a great experience,My friends and I took the tram to the summit and used the hiking trails. Great way to gain some vert but a little pricey at 40+ dollars
118,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Bozeman, MT ",Waffles!,"We took the tram up to the summit with two limited mobility adults, and one ten year old, and one adult. Two of us hiked to the peak and enjoyed the views. The waffle restaurant was a great stop for them to rest and us to grab a very tasty treat before making our way down. It was too much of a walk from the tram to the gondola for our handicapped so we only got to use one part of the ticket, making it pricey. Maybe they could offer a handicapped rates for the tram only since that is more easily accessible?"
119,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Great way to see the view,Felt it was a bit pricey but a nice way to enjoy the breathtaking mountains. You get the opportunity to use the same ticket for two shorter rides. Go early enough to enjoy at least one other one.
120,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Orlando, FL ",Awesome Views!,"This was a very cool ride to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. Beautiful views at the top, with a small restaurant that serves waffles. A bit pricey, but if you book online you can save $7. The price also includes the Gondola ride, which was basically a private car up another nearby mountain. If you’re lucky, you can see animals below on your ride."
121,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Inverness, FL ",Fun!,Enjoyed the free gondola ride and dinner outside. Several artists were working outdoors. Great view!
122,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Waffles at the top!,"We bought the family pack online and saved a lot of money over the prices you pay if you simply show up without tickets. We were able to get on the tram right away and enjoy the 12 minute ride up to the top. Although there were several others on the tram, it was not crowded and we had plenty of room to move around. The views are great and you learn about the area on your way up. We were one of the first ones off the tram and went straight to Corbet's Cabin and ordered waffles. They have several different varieties and they were all good. There are no utensils though, so you eat everything with your hands.    Our tickets were also good for the gondolas and the ski lift. We went up the ski lift because it is a fun and different experience from the tram. We didn't have time for the gondola unfortunately. They have a mountain bike course close to the ski lift and people were taking their bikes up the ski lift and then riding back down the course. You can rent bikes and gear at the shop nearby. I wish we would have had more time for this because my kids really wanted to do it. There were also several other activities in the area. I remember seeing a rock climbing wall and a bungee trampoline. You could spend a the better part of a day here."
123,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Rochester, MN ",A must do!,"Amazing!!!! Must do while visiting Jackson Hole. Eat the waffles at Corbin’s on the summit. Hiking trails available at the summit. Also, if you’re brave you can ride the tram to the summit and go para gliding!"
124,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"League City, TX ",on top of the world,tram ride up was 12 minutes. the waffles on top were YUM! the walk and views up there were breathtaking!
125,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fayetteville, AR ",Gorgeous view,"Pricey to ride up for a few views, pics, and waffles. I accomplished all 3 in 15 minutes with my free access I received from the Teton Club as a timeshare owner. You can ride free after 5 pm but the last tram down is 5:30 pm ( or you can walk down to Gondola on summer access road or hiking trail, it stays open until 9 pm or if you feel extra gung ho walk the trails or access road all the way down). I'm glad I went but if i would have paid $40 to ride up for a few views and a waffle to go, I may not feel the same. It's up to you and your budget what it is worth. I went up before 10 am and I noticed the crowds everywhere in Teton Village or Jackson Hole is much more manageable before 10 am and are crazy busy at 11 am."
126,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Columbus, GA ",Amazing View!,"The view is worth a ride to the top! You can hike up there during the summer, too. Corbet's Cabin is super casual with to go waffles. Great place to see Jackson Hole!"

The views are gorgeous and you must get the waffles!! I really loved the waffle with the brown sugar butter inside. It made for a fun mid morning adventure."
128,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019,not available,"Peoria, IL ",Butt clenchingly fun!,"Wow, that was a rush of a ride and we are so glad that we did it. Being on top of that mountain and to have imagined skiing down it with snow was mind boggling. Not being a skier we certainly gained a ton more of respect for these folks that ski down that mountain slope. Their price could best reflect the time of day you go up according to the time you go up. And, their definition of KIDS on their board was misleading. Family pack indicates parents and four kids for x amount while there is no definition of what age is a kid. For us with three children they are our Kids so whats their deal?"
129,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Couples, ,Favorite part of our trip!,"I honestly didn't know what to expect. I purchased our tickets online before our trip to save a few bucks. Of course the scenery on the ground is beautiful, but riding the tram up and seeing the view at the top is incredible! There really is no comparison. The tram ride was quick and smooth. We visited Corbin's Cabin for a famous waffle - it did not disappoint. So delicious! We then decided to hike down to the gondola instead of riding the tram back down - best decision ever! Now for this GA peach, this was not an easy hike down. The terrain was rough, the trail was not well marked and still covered with snow in areas, BUT this was the most fun adventure of our trip. The decision to hike down was last minutes, but thankfully, my husband bought his CamelBak. I wouldn't recommend hiking down without something similar. it took us around 2 hours to reach the gondola where we road down the rest of the way. then we enjoyed lunch in Teton Village."
130,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Bentonville, AR ",Great views at the top,We read the reviews and thought this would be a fun way to see the area. The first day it was cloudy and so we opted to wait. So glad we did as the views the next morning were spectacular. We also road up with folks paragliding off the top. That was an added bonus that was fun to watch. We learned the ticket prices are a little cheaper if you book online. The Teton Village Ski area was fun to explore.
131,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Everglades City, FL ",Great views,"Worth doing this! The views from 10,000 ft are amazing! And there is a fun Waffle House on top ( expensive though!!)  You can hike from the top. There are various trails but going down is very steep and rocky at the top."
132,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Couples,San Carlos ,"Fun, but watch the weather","We went up there in July. They charge up to a certain point and then it is free to ride up the tram. Caveat, it gets cold up there. We weren’t really impressed by the menu and just went for a drink."
133,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Mobile, AL ",View from the top!,"This is a good way to see the entire Jackson area, from the highest point.  We went around 10:00 AM on Sunday. Lines were manageable and quick.  At the top, we enjoyed beautiful views."
134,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Queens, NY ",Great ride! Awesome views!,"On a recent trip to Grand Teton National Park, we stayed in Teton Village and took the Tram one morning up to the top of the mountain. Although it was overcast at the bottom of the mountain, the tram took us above the clouds for some spectacular views.  The whole trip, back and forth, will take about an hour, however, if you wish to stay for a meal (we did not) you can stay up there longer.  I would recommend this to anyone in the area of Teton Village."

138,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",One of Our Favorites,"We were a party of 13, with age ranges from 7-72. We were here on June 18, and there was still quite a bit of snow on top. People that were doing the hikes up there really needed to be prepared to be walking in snow.    We bought the tickets online while in the parking lot to save $10. We didn’t have to wait very long and were able to get on the next tram that came. It was 72 degrees at the base of the tram, and 44 at the top and SUPER windy. Be prepared by taking layers with you. There was one family that was not prepared, and rode the tram up, stepped off and realized how cold it was, and rode the next one back down. When we first arrived it was super windy, very cold, and drizzling. We went up to the top of the world hike to the lookout on top, and it was soooo cold. We felt like we were going to blow right off the top. We then went into the little restaurant where they serve famous waffles. We took some pictures outside of the restaurant, but the rain wouldn’t let up. Went inside for awhile and ordered some hot chocolate, waffles with Nutella, and waffles with brown sugar. They were really good, I have to admit. The last few summers we have gone to other places where there are these types of must get items, and I have been let down by them. Not here! These waffles were really good!    Then I realized the rain stopped and I went outside again. It was a little warmer, so I decided to go back up to the top. It was much warmer this time. I saw Grand Teton which was really cool to see it from this angle. We were so lucky because there was rain in areas around us. I even saw a lightning strike which was a little scary to be so high with the lightning. After more pictures and videos, we went back down the next tram.    We were hoping to see wildlife on the mountain while up and down on the tram, but we only saw a deer. We were hoping for bear, but we didn't see any. The views are amazing from the top, and this was one of our favorite things to do in the area. I would guess that this took us about 1 1/2 hours from the time we arrived to the time we left."
139,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Raleigh, NC ",A view beyond description!,"After a smooth ride to the top of Rendezvous Mountain, you will find amazing views, a chance to stretch your legs, and delicious waffles! A must when visiting Teton Village."

143,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Middleton, WI ",Exceeded Expectations!,"I thought this might be a nice diversion so I persuaded my exhausted family to give it a try. When we saw the price, we almost turned away. But it also doesn't take much for us to decide to splurge on vacation, so we did it anyway.... and it was really awesome.  Getting on the tram was a painless process. The tram operator on the way up was great at both pointing out scenic areas and wildlife but also at putting some guests who were nervous at ease. I stood the whole way up because the car was pretty full, but it still seemed to fly by. Before we knew it, we were above the snow line. Stepping out at the summit was so neat! We immediately climbed the steps to the top, which aren't many, but I would advise against doing what we did and hang around a few minutes to acclimate. The altitude really made me breathless after those steps.  Walked around a bit, made a stone cairn as others have done, got some hot chocolate and a waffle at the cafe up there, and then it was back down.  The views up here are just stunning and on the way down, we saw a grizzly cub running on the mountain. If you came to see snow covered mountains, then despite the cost, you'll be happy you did this."
144,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Lawrence, KS ",Beautiful views and fun ride,"We didn’t have to wait long and it was a gorgeous ride up and smooth. Go for the traditional waffle and cocoa up top, delicious. :)"
145,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019 , Couples, ,Great Views and late snow,"The Tram is a fantastic place to see the Grand Tetons. On a clear day most of the valley is visible. A snowball fight is never out of the question. We had a few snowboarders on our tram. Great time, great views."
146,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2019 , Family,"Greeley, CO ",Buy tickets on line and save,At first glance this looks a bit much for a ride up the hill But with the Tram ticket you also get to ride one of the chairlifts and the gondola. I recommend the chairlift then the gondola where you can get lunch eat outside with wonderful views of the valley. Then take the Tram to have a waffle for dessert at Corbin’s cabin in the summit. So with all of that the $34 was well spent. Years 5 and under are free

148,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Columbia, MD ",Awesome view,"Simply a great experience. At 10,000 feet, the entire valley of Jackson Hole is laid out before you, it’s a fantastic Jew of the Snake River as it meanders through the valley. And at the top, some incredibly good waffles await. Don’t miss this."
149,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Mrs,"Great experience! Got to ride all day with purchase of the ticket -on the tram, chairlift and gondola- waffles at the top are a must too!"

The ride was Beautiful, the conductors were very nice, and informative! And at the top, magnificent! Plus, it’s a really nice place to get WAFFLES!!! I loved this and definitely recommend it."
151,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,Louisiana ,"Nice, but crowded","Positives: nice view, could ride. Goes fast to the top of the mountain. Preferred the smaller gondola. LOVED CORBINS CABIN AT THE TOP!!!!"
152,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019,not available,"Springfield, IL ",awesome,wow it was wonderful and i went on a day that was snowing and 20 degrees below 0 on the summit of the mountain
153,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"San Antonio, TX ",Great experience!,Felt like we were on top of the world. Loved the experience because we got to see snow. Cute little restaurant at the top that serves waffles.
154,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Great view but pricey,Took up family 6 - waffles great but windy and cold- didn’t stay up long. The pass is good for day but June weather wasn’t agreeable. Very expensive but spectacular view
155,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family, ,A Must Do in Teton Village,"If you're in Teton Village, you have to do the Tram. I'd also suggest doing the Gondola as well as the ski lift with your same ticket. Although the trails were closed at the top of the Tram due to the weather (time of year we went - early June) this trip, my prior trip we really enjoyed the hiking. Views at the top are awesome. Got to watch paragliders take off which the kids found enjoyable. Had the waffles at the top... overrated in our opinion but it's something to do while up there. On the ride down we got to see a bear and her three cubs. I'd definitely recommend doing a Tram ride."
156,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Charlotte, NC, ","It was fun, but it was also expensive","$98 for a family, or $37 per adult...it's expensive. No way around that.    We decided to do it based on recommendations from friends, and while it was expensive, it was a neat experience. The tram takes you from the bottom of Rendezvous mountain to the top, about 4,000 ft up from ground level; 10,000 above sea level. The views at the top are incredible, and cold (bring a jacket). Corbet's cabin is really the only attraction at the top of the mountain in the summer. The waffles and hot chocolate were good, but nothing I'd go overboard over.  Just note for those that are afraid of heights, while the tram ride is fun, and super smooth, it does swing slightly when it comes through the tower points, which can be unsettling for those. You do have an opportunity to see wildlife while riding the tram, we saw a black bear on our way up."
157,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019,not available, ,Nice ride but pricey,"It was very smooth but the cost is crazy for a less than hour visit up top. Also, couldn’t get waffles bc the system was down. They wouldn’t let you pay in cash either. It was crazy that they wouldn’t do old school math instead of using the register. I heard many complaints over this on the ride back down."
158,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Surprise, AZ ",Amazing views of the Tetons,"We had reservations for a boat ride on Jenny Lake for our second day in the area, but after seeing how bad the parking lot was at Jenny Lake, and fighting the construction traffic to the park and the traffic jams in Jackson we decided to stop at Teton Village instead - a low stress drive from where we were staying. The first thing we did was take the tram up to. Amazing views on the way up, and spectacular views once you get to the top. We wandered around on top to take in the breathtaking scenery. It was one of the highlights of our two week road trip."
159,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Columbus, OH ",Worth the Price,"Get your tickets online, you save $7 per ticket. Also, This ticket is good for one day use of not just the big tram but also, the smaller gondola lifts on the north end of campus that take you up to different restaurants and look outs. The tram leaves every 15 min on the quarter hours. We went up June 13 at 11am and it was about 50 degrees up there and beautiful, but very windy on the west side. There was alot of snow still, which was fun to walk in and see. We walked down the back side trail to as far as we could until the snow stopped us. Actually, all the trails were closed due to snow at that point. But the views are unbelievable, and the snow, although blocked trails, was just stunning to see up there. We all got waffles and although their reviews were so so, we all thought they were great! It wasn't too crowded when we were up there, but I asked the workers there and they said on busy days, they make about 500 waffles!"
160,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Port Orchard, WA ",Fun Fun & More Fun,"It was fun to visit Teton Village & especially to ride the state-of-the-art tram to the top of the peak. What a beautiful and exciting journey! I know sometimes the cost of an attraction like this can be a deterrent, but it cost big bucks to build a safe, comfortable system like the aerial tram. Plus, let's face it, most of us would not otherwise get a chance to enjoy the wonderful vistas that jump out at you along the way. There is something so refreshing when reach the top and enjoy a view of the world you never imagined. The day we went up, we got to watch the para-gliders set up and take off, so that really added to our enjoyment. I think the customer service of this venue is very impressive. We received friendly, cheerful assistance at every step along the way. Well staffed and every employee made us feel welcome. Short drive from Jackson. Free parking. Nice."
161,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples, ,Went to the top of the mountain,Such a view once you get to the top! Feels like you are on top of the world! You can stay up at the top as long as you like catching another tram down so no rush to get on and off.
162,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples, ,A Must See and Do,"This was totally out of my comfort zone, but beautiful and amazing. The tram makes you feel safe and protected. The restaurant at the top is a must try for waffles ."
163,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Keller, TX ",Worth the trip!,Gorgeous views! Definitely save the money and buy passes online. They have a great family pack-deal for two adults and four kids. Ride is smooth and amazing views. Waffles at the top is a must!! Rides come every 15 minutes so you never really wait long! So glad we went!
164,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Rosharon, Texas, United States ",WOW,This was a super cool experience for us as well as our teens. Beautiful view while you are going up to the summit. Beautiful view for miles while you are up there. The Waffles and coccoa was a nice treat.
165,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Pittsgrove, NJ ",A must do activity while visiting Jackson Hole and environs!,"The twelve minute ride up to Rendezvous Mountain covers over 4,100 feet. The views are amazing, and this time of year there was still a snow line. It's really worthwhile to buy online since it's substantial savings. On our day, the weather was formidable in the afternoon so we didn't book our morning tickets until we were in the parking lot and sure we would beat the weather. Once on top, its almost a necessity to experience the gourmet waffles in Corbet's Cabin. Your made to order waffles are served in aluminum foil; I got the English lemon and my wife the Nutella. They are especially good, but one wonders why waffles and not say hot dogs? Once you taste them you wouldn't want anything else from the top of the world. The ride is smooth and each car has its own narrator. You can see Jackson below and come to understand while it was called ""hole""."
166,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Fort Smith, AR ",Vacation,"A must do/see activity while at the Grand Tetons. You access the Tram at the Teton Village which we drove up to Moose and took the Moose/Wilson Rd. (390) from there back down to Teton Village without having to pay the National Park entry fee. We had already purchased the Tram tickets/wrist band while in Jackson Hole, Wy. Saved some $$ there. With this purchase we were able to ride the Tram and the gondola. Very nice, fun ride. Beautiful view!!"
167,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ","Breathtaking views of the Tetons and the “Hole""","Nothing different from any other aerial Tram/Cable car rides as far as the ride itself is concerned. However, the views from the top are just spectacular and awesome."
168,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Gardiner, ME ",Pricey but worth it,"The ride up Rendezvous Mountain is fantastic and the view from the top can't be beat. Take some time to enjoy it up there, including a drink (hot or cold) at Waffles. Paragliders were out in full force and we were fortunate enough to see a couple take off, with one of them doing a fly by before going on his way. The trams go every 15 minutes so you can take as much or as little time as you want. It seemed a bit pricey at $40/ea but we felt we got the value for it."
169,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Orlando, FL ",Pricy but worth the experience,"Although a single day pass for a family can be a bit expensive, the views and experience at the top of the mountain offset the cost."
170,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Awesome Views,Non-skiers: A pleasant ride to the top with great views all around. Still snow on top the last week of May. I wish we had tied the waffles.
171,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019 , Friends,"Santa Cruz, CA ",Top of world,We went on the tram on a beautiful morning. I didn’t know what to expect. The tram operator also was a tour guide. The view was amazing. We saw a moose and a bear on the way up to the top. Once we got there we had breakfast at the Waffle House and walked onto the snow apex to watch paragliders jump off the cliff.
172,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Summer Adventure,"Worth the family pass for two adults and three kids. Don't forget a light coat, wear something that grips it is going to be a bit muddy and snow on the top. Pack some waters so you don't have to spend a ton when up there, and don't forget to buy you a waffle at the top. We loved the one with brown sugar the most. Worth it. If you are patient you can catch someone taking flight and get some great photos, or if you are daring enough you can glide down from the top. Bonus points we saw some staff ride the trolly back down the mountain by sitting on the very top of the highest point of the cable box - that if you could buy it would be one heck of a ride."
173,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Caputh, UK ",Day in Jackson Hole,"View down to the Snake River from the top of the lift is amazing, as is the view along to the Grand Teton. You can make it as short or as long a trip as you like, with plenty walking off the top. Really friendly staff. Very reminiscent of the Mannlichen cable car in Wengen, Switzerland."
174,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2019 , Family,"Columbus, OH ",Breathtaking Experience,"#1. It is kind of pricey  #2. It will test your nerves as the gondola reaches the top (and as you look at your surroundings)  #3. Wow, what a view and something you will always remember. It was literally breathtaking.  #4. I had a boot on my left foot and I felt completely comfortable. There is plenty of area to walk around up at the top with pushing things.  #5. The little restaurant did have amazing waffles. My son had one and it was awesome!    We were up there for probably 30 minutes and it was a great experience for everyone in our party (ages 9 to 47)."
175,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019 , Couples,"Renton, WA ",Good experience!,"Kinda pricey even with the $7 online discount. There was snow at the top, so no trail hiking. BUT we got to see a few paragliders! There is a program for tandem paragliding here. There is also a waffle restaurant up there. The tram runs on the quarter hour, weather permitting. The ride is about 15-20 mins."
176,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018,not available,"Saint Louis, MO ",Amazing Views!,"Tram is very large and feels quite safe. Once you're to the top, it's breathtaking....and very chilly! Plan to spend plenty of time at the top since you'll likely not see views like this again."
177,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019 , Couples,"Liberty Lake, WA ",Do it!,"It was exciting to think about it before we embarked on this short adventure, and it turned out to be exactly that - exciting! One interesting detail - we looked up their ticket prices on line, and it stated $27 for a senior, but when we were purchasing our tickets at the office onsite, we were told that discount was only for online purchase and we were supposed to pay full price $32. After a little bit of talking, the guy was nice and gave us our senior discount - thanks for that. After that everything was just wonderful. The ride was smooth and it was fun to observe the whereabouts under us trying to spot a bear or moose that often wonder in those places. Then it was so amazing to find yourself in full swing winter with tons of snow, 22 F, and pretty windy. We saw some famous crazy skiing slopes like Corbet, etc., and finally, we enjoyed the most delicious hot waffles in the tiny cafeteria ""on top of the world"". All of the staff was super friendly and accomodating. What a fun activity! Thank you!"
178,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019 , Family,"New Kent, VA ",NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...BUT FOREVER MEMORIES WERE MADE!,"True story. We caught the tram around 11:00am and the winds were so strong, the tram had a hard time docking at the top. It seemed a little touch and go there for a bit. We went into the restaurant at the top to eat waffles (a must do) and when we decided to leave, we were told the winds were too strong to get the tram down off of the mountain! The tram runs back and forth in 15-minute intervals but in our case, we waited 2.5+ hours to get down! It was a little scary in that you didn't really know if or when you'd get down! But the result of this unfortunate incident is what made for the best memories! We made friends, talked with people we wouldn't have otherwise, played with the small children to keep them entertained in such a small space for so long and had a blast! I wouldn't have traded one minute for anything. After all, it's these unusual events that often make for the best memories. In regard to the tram personnel, they were helpful and communicative. The guy who ran the restaurant was giving the children snacks. We played games and just hung out. We were told this has rarely happened so it shouldn't scare anyone away from taking the trip. If you are concerned about it, though, you might want to ask the tram operators about the wind speeds that day. Otherwise, all is well that ends well :)"
179,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019 , Couples,"Baltimore, MD ",Snow in May!,Fun racing to the top enjoy a coffee drink or cold beer with your waffle! Snowball fights and making angels in snow. Breathtaking views from the top!
180,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019,not available,"Evanston, IL ",Despite White Out...,Despite the white out at the top of mountain I’m glad I took the tram up. What we could see was very cool and the waffles were delicious.
181,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019 , Friends,"Chicago, IL ",Awesome Activity!,"My mom and I rode the tram up, and it was such a fun activity! It was cool to watch the change in weather from the base to the summit. It was way too snowy and windy to hike the top, but we did enjoy some really delicious waffles up top. I felt like the tram was worth it, even if all you can do is snack on some yummy waffles - we got the lemon and the brown sugar and butter and they were both so good!"
182,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2019 , Friends,"Boise, ID ",Wonderful views,May 18 was quite bad weather and yet the ascent into winter was exhilarating. We appreciated the hot chocolate at the top after briefly admiring the views.

We caught the early tram every morning for a week whilst taking part in the Steep and Deep Camp.  Great place to talk to people on your way to the high slopes and back country. Spent early morning in Corbetts Cabin but missed out on the Waffles, will have to go back just for them"
184,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,Paradise  ,We loved this!,This was the highlight of our trip to Jackson. Be sure and take some cold-weather gear because it is very cold at the top and usually breezy.

186,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Apr 2019 , Family,"Kimberly, ID ",Worth the Visit,"We weren't skiing just visiting the area. The new Tram is wonderful, I miss the old smaller one but the large one is more accommodating. The views are to die for and well worth the time and money to see."
187,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2019 , Friends,"Portland, OR ",Spectacular View & Waffles!,"Its wonderful to be able to view the Teton Valley from 10,400 feet and not have to ski down double black diamonds. An added bonus is the made-to-order waffles at the top. The tram is state of the art and while crowded on the way up with expert skiiers, you will have it nearly to yourself for the ride down viewing many of the runs that make Jackson Hole famous."
188,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2019 , Family,"Little Rock, AR ",Great ride to the summit!,"Great way to look down over Jackson Hole! The 10 minute ride to the top is not cheap, so you might as well have waffles at the top. Great photo opportunities and the guy in control makes it a fun ride."
189,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Gillette, WY ",Impressive and Terrifying,"I rode the tram a couple of times, and I was terrified because I have acrophobia!!! I rode the tram the first time to say that I did, and then, 40 years later, I rode it again so my granddaughter wouldn't have to ride alone. The sight is impressive to say the least. The cost factor is another issue, but if you are a climber, a skier, hiker, etc., then ride the tram so that you can say you did. From a Skier's perspective, the tram to the bottom used to be the steepest in the U.S. I am not sure if that is still the case."
190,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2019 , Friends,"Hamburg, NY ",Ski it from the top!,"Rode the tram to ski from the top. The lines were reasonable (15-20 minutes) and the Tram atmosphere is hard to beat. That is assuming you don't mind being jammed in with 100 other people. The ride up is quick, and the views are spectacular if you are able to get close to the outside of the cabin. If you are not a skier that's fine you can ride up and down to enjoy the atmosphere and scenery. Keep in mind it will likely be colder and windier than at the base. Be prepared!"
191,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2019 , Friends, ,Slowest way up,"I’m sure the tram in the summer is nice but in the winter the lines are very long.  100 people at a time are crammed inside, with their skis poles snowboards and backpacks . You don’t even need to hold on as there is no room to tip over.  Yes, it’s the only way to the bowl at the top and to the hike-to runs, and there IS a very good Waffle House at the top but it’s just not worth the ride.  Worst time to take the tram is 9 AM when the lifts open. It’s a bit better later in the day but don’t expect more space. One can’t even enjoy the view as one is packed in like sardines."
192,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018,not available,"San Antonio, TX ",It's a long way up and down,"We stayed in Jackson Hole and decided to take tour around the area. We picked the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram. It takes a little while to get to the top but not excessively. It is 10,450 ft at the top. You get out of the tram and the wind tries to carry you off the mountain. The tram stop is not the top. You have to get off, walk away from the tram and onward to where you climb a number of steps to the summit. Better get your breath before you try the steps. At the top you find a couple of large mounds which are the actual summit which you can carefully climb. You can see a great deal of countryside from that high up. The Corbet's Cabin is up there just below the summit to the left of the tram stop. You can buy hot and cold beverages, sandwiches, snacks, etc. The Waffles too. have a seat inside or out on the deck overlooking the valley. It was September so there was no snow, not that we were disappointed. Walking around was a bit of a chore since the altitude takes it out of you. On the ride down we saw a black bear running across from tree line to tree line. Didn't see one at all during our tour of Yellowstone over the previous 5 days."
193,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2019 , Friends,"Laguna Niguel, CA ",Weeee,Get near the windows for a beautiful ride. The towers create a little roller coaster. Music is good to settle the nerves before they warn you it’s for experts only. It’s is all good and beautiful coming down too.
194,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2019 , Family,"Richmond, VA ",Outbound Trams Packed to Capacity in the Winter,"I was unable to ski while at Jackson Hole due to a earlier ski injury, but wanted to see the mountain (and fortunately had a season ski pass to cover the cost). The max capacity is 100, and that’s how many people are on board for the trip up the mountain. At the top is a small restaurant that sells delicious waffles, and both warm and cold beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic). There are rest rooms there as well, but no running water. On the ride back down there were only about 10 people on board, so I was able to enjoy the fabulous view and take photos. I’d love to visit Jackson Hole in the summer and ride the tram; the adult fee is around $35 during peak season."
195,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Waltham, MA ",Ohh that line - ugh,Unfortunately the line even in the quietest part of a weekday was still 45 minutes long.  The good part is that the view is great when it’s not foggy or cloudy. It’s worth going up once on a clear day. And we did find great snow on some nice challenging terrain.
196,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2019 , Friends, ,The view at the top is breathtaking,Quick trip to the top! Don't forget to grab a waffle at Corbets Cabin it's a must in Jackson Hole!!!

198,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2019 , Friends,"Sioux City, IA ",Great view and great skiing but you may have to wait.,The tram takes you to some of the very best skiing on the mountain and certainly delivers outstanding views. The wait can be long and you have to decide how long is it worth while others are poaching powder at lower levels. It can feel very tight on busy days but all in all you should take the tram at least one time and if it happens to be a quiet day...then go as often as your legs can take.
199,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2019 , Family,"Panama City, FL ",Worth it for the View,"Okay, here is the downside...riding up, to say you are packed in like a sardine is being conservative. But, the trip is relatively quick, and the view from the top is amazing. Corbet’s Cabin at the top is a cool place for a cup of coffee or hot chocolate, but be warned—they stop serving waffles at 2:30 pm. Riding back down, you will have the tram to yourself because most everyone else will be skiing to the bottom."
200,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2019,not available,"McDonough, GA ",What a View...not a view!,"We paid the $34 fee to ride to the top and back down. We were about the only tourist in the bunch as most of the people going up were either snowboarders or skiers. The tram holds 100 people at a time and you stand in one of those cattle herding lines. It moves pretty quickly but the around 15 minutes per load seemed long with two small children and it was very cold. Make sure to dress warmly. It was fun that Nature Valley had a young lady there throwing bars up to the folks. You switched from being a cow to being a sardine for the ride up. I mean you cannot move and unless you get on the edge, you can't see much. We just stayed on (It was below zero at the top). It was awesome going down. Stunning Views! Lots of activity to see, as well. We even saw a moose and her baby."

205,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2019 , Family,"Christchurch, New Zealand ",Fast and convenient,"We rode up the tram to ski off Rendevous Mountain, but if you just want to see the views it is worth it. The tram fits 100 people, which means the line moves quickly and you don't end up waiting for more than 2 trams.

First this aerial tram is HUGE, it holds +-100 people. It climbs ~ 4000' in elevation over a 2.5ish mile ride. It is super smooth!    At the top there is obviously breathtaking views of the steep slopes, ski paths and the valley.    The restaurant is known for waffles and they were great. Light and fluffy unlike any other waffle. Try the peanut butter and bacon one...I know...just do it.    Enjoy the ride!"
209,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2018,not available,"Charlotte, NC ",Must see attraction,Even with no snow this is a must visit for the view at the top and also the waffles that are waiting for you. Unbelievable views that can't be beat while at the top and the guides were very knowledgable on the way up and down. The little waffle house at the top made the whole trip worth while even in the cold weather.

211,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2018 , Family,Naples ,Good view,What you can expect from a tram.  Friendly service - packed.  They sell tickets for aerial tour but they just cram you with skiers so you don’t really enjoy the view.
212,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Redditch, UK ","Great summer experience, but not value for money","Value for money doesn’t seem to mean very much anywhere in Jackson Hole, and that follows here as well. A single ticket to ride the Aerial Tram cost $48 each (although we did spot a $5 discount voucher in the local tourist newspaper, so keep your eyes open for these).    However, we were looking forward to the view at the top, and we were not disappointed. It’s a great panoramic view up there, and the tram itself is a super ride. Included in the price was a trip up their Bridger Gondola for a different, not quite so impressive view, and we also went up the Chairlift that was running – mainly just for the ride. It is, however, the Aerial Tram that is the main attraction, and the other ones were just sideshows.    The ride and the view are special. It just loses a star for value."
213,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2018 , Family,"Lake Forest, IL ",Works class skiing at its finest,"Skiing Jackson Hole at Teton Village is world class skiing at its finest! The snow in the Tetons is dry, light and usually deep, with downhill terrain to challenge the most advanced skills. And due to the remarkable lift capacity there is rarely any wait to get back up the mountain. The slope side accommodations are outstanding, with ski apres activities for the whole family."
214,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018,not available, ,This is the tram that takes you to the top of the mountain.,We went up the mountain to see the sights. There was a unique restaurant there that was called the waffle house. They make the batter then they send it up the mountain where it is more that 5000 ft above sea level. They say it makes the waffles more light and delicious.  The only problem I had was they had no running water??? So how do they wash their hands or the dishes???  But over all it was a great experience.
215,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Lawrenceville, GA ",Great experience and spectacular views,"First of all, I recommend that you look for internet coupons or pick up a coupon at your hotel for a reduced price for the ride. My wife and I rode the aerial tram during our visit in late September of 2018. The views going up and at the top were spectacular, including a bear sighting on the way up. Once we got to the top, we walked around the area and were rewarded with spectacular views, even though we did have smoke from the fires in northern Montana. In my opinion, the hazy skies gave more depth to the views and only added to the experience. The small building at the sight sold delicious waffles, coffee, and souvenirs. Definitely worth the cost and I highly recommend it."
216,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Solo,"Philadelphia, PA ",360° View and Waffles,"From the summit of Rendezvous Mountain you can enjoy a stunning 360° view of the surrounding mountain range and Corbet’s Cabin offers a variety of delicious waffles. The tram ride itself comes with amazing views as well, it is a little pricey but still worth it. But tickets online and save $8 per ticket!"
217,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Auburn, NY ",A MUST!! Didn't think it was worth price - UNTIL we went up!!,"The Jackson Hole Aerial Tram was one of the last things we did during our stay in Teton Village in October. In fact, we rode it on the last day of the season. Parf of the reason for our holding off until the end was the price - it is $40 per person - which lets you ride all day but was still $80 for my husband and I. We decided our trip wouldn't be complete without that view and experience, so we went ahead. The operators of the tram are great - they provide educational information and humor during the approximately 12-14 minute ride up the mountainside. The ride itself is really very nice - great views - comfortable - there were just two areas where I noted a 'swinging' of the tram - just slight - and staff tell you about it as you approach. At the top, we exited the tram and were awestruck with the views!! We knew instantly that this was DEFINITELY worth $80!! We walked around the platform and over to the snowcovered mountain peak - there was a set of stairs that led to the very top of the peak - the stairs were snow covered and really difficult to navigate but of course everyone did! All passengers were friendly and collaborative with each other - taking photos for others - all smiles!! It was COLD up there - we were glad we wore lots of layers and brought hats and gloves. The views from the very top peak were stunning - no photo can do it justice. We stayed there about 30 minutes then walked down the stairs and into a little building to warm up (still on top of the mountain). Corbett's Cabin sells hot drinks and waffles!! The waffles are delicious and reasonably priced at $7.75 each! Lots of options for toppings. Great place to site and warm up. After our coffee and waffles we went back up to the peak and took in all the views again before we rode the tram back down to the base. You can ride it multiple times (you get a wristband). We walked away with a memory/view of a lifetime! So glad we did it!"
218,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Gilbert, AZ ",Currently Closed for Season. Call first,The whole resort is now closed until winter season. Call before you go. It is still worth it to go up to the hotel and walk around. There are lots of bike and walking paths
219,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2018 , Friends,"Santa Clara, CA ",Worth the Trip!,"Friends and I enjoyed this tram trip to the top of the mountain. There are hiking trails for those a bit more adventurous, but we were content to wander around the viewing area. Note that it is a 4,000 ft climb, so be sure ot wear sunscreen,. i got a sunburn from the high altitude!"
220,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,The view is worth the Trip,"This tram takes you up to around 10,400 feet high where you can then have the best waffles you have ever tasted while you have a incredible view."
221,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Solo,"West Chester, PA ",Awesome views,"If you're visiting Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park, be sure to take the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain for breathtaking views of the entire area."
222,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2018 , Solo, ,"A little pricey, but you can save money by buying on line.","In my opinion the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram is a bit pricey for what you get, but the views from the top are gorgeous."
223,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"St Helens, UK ",A disappointing experience,"However it was free after 5 pm so no complaints. The view looks across the valley at 9,500 ft up about 2,000 ft above Grand Teton Village. It does not give any views into the Teton Park or it's peaks as they are on the same side of the valley & out of sight around the corner. lots of people do go up as there is a bar and restaurant as it is a skiing area in winter."
224,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Champaign, IL ",Wonderful,It was well worth it. The views are fantastic. We saw 3 moose sleeping on the way up. Smooth ride! Nice little gift shop and place for hot drinks.
225,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Scottish Highlands, UK ",A must do experience!,We just happened to go to see if the tram was running and so glad we did! Very well organised service with friendly staff. The experience and the views are well worth the cost as you won’t get the same experience elsewhere. Hot chocolate and waffle warmed us up nicely after our walk around the summit area.
226,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018,not available,"Fort Lauderdale, FL ",See Jackson Hole From The Air,"Jackson Hole is a very nice town to visit on your way into Yellowstone but you have to stop and take a ride on the Aerial Tram to the top. When you arrive at the top you must, I repeat... you must stop for a waffle. You will probably want to order a few at a time because you can not eat just one. I can honestly say they are the best I have ever had. That was the highlight of the ride but the view happen to be spectacular. We even got the chance to see and take pictures of two guys jumping off the mountain hang-gliding. We then took a walk to the other side and took the smaller gondola down.. The town below has some good bars and restaurants to stop in and have a drink or two. Worth the trip."
227,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Family,"Wake Forest, NC ",Chilly in September,Great views. Fun and comfortable ride. There are several nice trails of varying length. Very cold in September. 36 degrees the day we went & even colder with the wind. We tool advantage of an amazing opportunity to paraglde - there is an adventure center at the base. Fun experience for both adults & my kids (9 & 11)
228,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Family,"Boston, MA ","Smooth ride to 10,000 Feet!","The tram is an experience to see the mountain from high above. The ride begins with safety instructions and some notes from the operator of what you are passing over, where to look or what to expect.  Once at the top, there is much to explore from the waffle house, to the stairs to view from the top of the world.  The view back down to the village is a nice shot with the camera as well.    Note: at the top, it is not uncommon to have some altitude sickness - worth paying attention to how you're feeling!"
229,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Family,"London, UK ",Stunning views but take a jumper,Amazing views from the top but freezing so take warm clothing. Great waffle cafe at the top. Not cheap but worth it.
230,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",Spectacular Views,"My friend and I rode the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram up and back on Friday afternoon, September 29, 2018. Although the ride was short (about 12 minutes each way), it was exciting to rise from about 7000 ft. to about 11,000 ft so effortlessly! Our tickets, which cost $34 each (senior rate) felt pricey, but since I'm not a skier, I've had very little experience being carried up a mountain! So I was willing to splurge. Probably never do it again, but I'm glad I did it once."
231,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,Houston ,Great views,My wife and I recently took the tram. Beautiful views at the top (and during the short ride). We did some walking at the top but not tons (as air a little thin). We also shared a waffle (I guess the restaurant on top is famous for these). All in all we were at the top for a little under 2 hours. Definitely recommend as part of your visit to Grand Teton.
232,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Vineyard Haven, MA ",Windy at the top,The tram goes every 15 minutes in September and is worth doing. If you buy tickets on line you save about $5 each.  Great views from the top even though there was a fire in the area and it was Smokey. I didn’t know I was afraid of heights until we got to the top and the wind was really blowing!
233,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"West Hartford, CT ",What a view,"This is a must do on your visit to Jackson Hole. Rising to 10,500 feet provides for a spectatular view of the Tetons. it is simply worth the trip. it is a view that cannot ve had anyplace else."
234,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Indian Trail, NC ",Ride to Rendezvous Mountain for waffles at 10000feet,The smooth comfy ride to the top is very rewarding. The views on a clear day are spectacular. There are also waffles and coffee at the top. Why not? It’s not as though I’m going to be here everyday. Very good experience
235,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Decatur, GA ",Go on top of the world!,"If you are staying in Jackson Hole, by all means take this trip up to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. A little pricey, but worth it for the view, hiking at the top, and more. A must see for your trip!"
236,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Austin, TX ",Convenient and fast,We used the tram to ascend to start our 5-day Teton Crest Trail backpacking trip. We purchased our tickets online at a discount. We had plenty of room with our large backpacks. I enjoyed conversations with the guys giving tandem paragliding flights; they use the tram to ascend the mountain with their large parachutes. The views were awesome.    I definitely want to return during ski season.
237,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018,not available,"Montgomery, TX ",Smooth Ride!!!,"This tram ride was flawless, so smooth and steady. In just 12 minutes, the Aerial Tram glides skyward 4,139 vertical feet. The summit offers staggering 360-degree views of the Tetons, Jackson Hole valley and surrounding mountain ranges.    This was a great experience during our stay in Jackson Hole in late September. Loved it!"
238,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Outstanding informative scenic ride,A must do outing in Jackson Hole! Whether you are traveling up or down to hike or just taking in the scenery it will not disappoint.
239,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"New Haven, CT ","Gorgeous views, great hiking and WAFFLES!",It may be $40 round trip but it is worth it! We rode the tram up and hiked the top of the world to rock springs to Codys bowl and then hiked back up. It was filled with such different terrain and there are sea fossils all over the place especially in the bowl. You don't even have to break any rocks to find great specimens of shells. Top it off with a delicious waffle before you go back down again. The waffles are pricey but mine was the most well earned and best tasting waffle ever!!!
240,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Linthicum Heights, MD ",A great experience,"So as your are going up the gentleman on the Tram gives you some background information which is interesting. At the top you can eat some deliciously amazing waffles,enjoy a breath-taking view, and have a great hike if you wish (we did). We finished at the other tram, enjoying a glass of wine and an amazing view! What a day!"
241,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Dallas, GA ",Breathtaking Views,"This tram takes you a little over 10,000 feet in the air and the views from the top are amazing, fun thing to do if in Teton Village"

243,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Placitas, NM ",Quite a sight,"This is a short excursion to the top of the mountain to observe Jackson Hole, meaning the whole valley and the circle of mountains.  Unfortunately, wild fires left the mountains shrouded in smoke.  It’s very chilly up there; hiking trails for the bold."
244,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Family,"Denver, CO ",Fun ride and a great hike to the gondola,"If you are anywhere near the ski resort, take the time to hop on the tram. The views  on the way up are breathtaking. My wife and I took our two grown children from the tram and hiked down to the gondola. The journey is mostly downhill and was one of the highlights of our trip to the Tetons and Yellowstone."
245,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Family,"Brooklyn Park, MN ",Stunning Views and Excellent Waffles!,"The only reason I didn’t give this five stars is because of the price. Adult tickets are $40 each. We brought our five-year-old and one-year-old with us, and they really liked it. It is much colder at the top of the mountain and it is at the base of the tram. It is also very windy up top so make sure to dress appropriately. Corbet’s Cabin has excellent waffles. Definitely worth a stop."
246,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ",Should Not Be Missed!,"If you spend any time at the Teton Village, there is no way you should not ride the tram. It is a truly exciting and breathtaking experience.    Also, you have to try the waffles sold at the top of the mountain."
247,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Bowie, MD ","Pricey, but worth the experience","Tickets are $40 on site or $35 online - we recommend just buying online. The big tram ride up is about 12 minutes each way and the views are truly worth the ticket price. Included in this ticket price are unlimited rides up and down until close and rides on the smaller tram to the mid lodge area. (The smaller lift is about a 10 min ride each way.) When you get to the top you have to stop and get a waffle at Corbet’s Cabin! (Waffle pictured with whipped cream is the English Waffle, it has a lemon filling and the plain looking waffle is the Italian Waffle stuffed with Nutella! Both were delicious.)"
248,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Couples, ,excellent ride to the top,we took the tram to the top so we can hike the trails. it was a wonderful view and saw a moose on the way down.

250,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Torrance, CA ",Great views but be ready to walk and be cold!,"You'd thing 'June'... Can't be that cold. Well at 10,000+ feet up, it is! The ride up was very smooth (as was the ride down). Upon reaching the top, you have incredible views to enjoy. And if you really want to get up to the peak, it a windy hike up another 100 feet in elevation, but well worth the effort (Remember, the air is much thinner up there!).  Enjoy!!!  BTW, Good luck finding a place to eat with reasonable prices"
251,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Sykesville, MD, ",Wonderful View,The Jackson Hole Aerial Tram offers a wonderful view of the entire Jackson Hole valley and mountains. We saw a resting moose on the right side coming down. The operator pointed it out about half way down.  This trip is expensive but we got a hotel and a senior discount that helped a bit.  There is a per-recorded message that gives some background information on the tram after you start the trip up. This is helpful and something that is not offered on many European lifts!  The summit is very windy. Watch out for your hat!
252,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Henderson, NV, ",Great Day!,"The aerial tram takes you up to more than 10,000 feet in 12 minutes! The ride was nice and David made it extra enjoyable with his information and sense of humor. We enjoyed the view and did a small hike. It was windy and 15 degrees cooler than below (54 degrees) and we needed a jacket so be prepared. Bring water too! There are plenty of trails to hike and they are posted at the top and pamphlets with all the trails at ticket office. You'll find Corbet's Cabin at the top offering their famous waffles. They had drinks and snacks too. There were hang gliders launching from here and was really great to watch. On the way up the mountain David told us our ticket was also good to ride the Bridger Gondola and Teewinot Chairlift but know this is only during certain times of the year but a great deal!!  I would like to emphasize from the ticket office to everyone we met who was working this aerial tram was noticeably friendly and helpful and made our experience so much nicer. Please know they offer military discounted tickets."

World famous waffles at the top at a restaurant - fast food type. We saw paragliders and hang gliders take off from the summit.
256,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Family,"Richmond, VA ",View is worth the ticket,The tram takes you up to the top of the mountain where you can look down the ski slopes or down the mountain in opposite direction. Temperature is 10 degrees colder so bring a jacket. Waffle shop was disappointing so don't plan on more than light snack there. Can see the famous Corbet's coulior ski run.  Tram ticket is for all day and includes the smaller older tram if you want another angle view. Parking is free and all staff was helpful and polite.
257,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Family,"Wyckoff, NJ ",Totally cool!!,"Awesome ride up the mountain to 10,000 feet where there is a cute place to get coffee and a waffle or buy some goodies. The views going up are amazing, we even spotted 2 moose! You can hike all the way down, part way down, or take the tram back down, and you'll hear some cool stories and information as you travel. AWESOME."
258,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Family,"Bridgewater, NJ ",Expensive but fun,"We rode up before the crowds around 9:30am. The ride up was fast at about 12 minutes. Once up, the views were limited because of the haze. We walked down the path for a bit and then had a drink at the cafe at the peak before going down. We were up there for about 1.5 hours. It was quite expensive but a fun thing to do. Also, it was quite cold up there!"

It's the longest non stop tram ride with over 15 miles of cables! Tram operator was very informative. Once you reach the top, you have a breathtaking 360 degree view of the mountains and valley...it's VERY windy at the top. If you get hungry you have to go to Corbet's Cabin Top of the World Waffles and get their fabulous homemade waffles and a cup of coffee or hot cocoa!"
261,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Family,"Chesapeake City, MD ","Up, up and away",A bit pricey but the view was so worth it.  Waffle at the top was worth it also. Even with the smoke haze you could still see far.

263,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Solo,"Jackson, Mississippi ","Buy the ticket, take the ride",Worth the 35 bucks. (Includes gondola) Great views from the top and access to a lot of hiking trails. I rode the first tram up and hiked back down to the gondola for the ride down. Awesome patio area at the gondola.
264,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Austin, TX ",A must Do in Jackson,We went in July. Take a jacket! It was July and when we got to the top is was in the 30's because a storm had just blown in. We went up and it was so cold we c=had to turn around and go back on the next Tram. We did hang out in the little canteen for a coffee which was interesting.
265,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Family,"Springfield - Delaware County, PA ",Wow wow wow,We loved the view from the top! We went early in the day and were happy we did. It was still fairly cool out and not super crowded. The Tram operators are very informative and nice to chat with about the Tram but also the Jackson area.  We had waffles at Corbet’s Cabin - delicious!!! We hiked a bit and took in the fantastic views!!!
266,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Couples,"Osage, IA ",Glad we went!!,"We did the Tram during our last trip to Jackson. We wanted to go when the weather was good so the views were good, so we did not purchase tickets ahead of time (which is cheaper). The cost of the TRAM was more than I anticipated but I feel like if you are doing a trip to the JH area, it’s worth it. The views are spectacular and my SO still talks about the peanut butter waffle he had at top of the world waffles!  If you are scared of heights, take note that the TRAM does do some swinging and when you exit at the top you do walk on a metal platform that you can see straight down. I didn’t have any problems but my SO isn’t as great with heights and the platform about made his knees buckle from under him."
267,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Couples,Alabama ,Stunning Views,"This is a must do experience. The trip on the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain offers spectacular views of the surrounding area. Standing on top of the mountain is a totally rewarding sight. Beautiful views in every direction. It was a sunny, fairly warm day, just perfect for incredible views. The ride up and down in the tram was excellent. While we were on the mountain top we began talking with Josh Smith, a tram operator from Albuquerque NM. A very well educated and interesting young man with a keen sense of humor. My husband has some mobility problems so when we were ready to descend Josh had us enter first from a different door so my husband could sit on the way down, we really appreciated his thoughtfulness. Josh kept everyone in stitches all the way down, love his grand sense of humor. He is an asset to the company. Thanks for a great time Josh."
268,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018,not available,"Depew, NY ",Fun but expensive,This was a fun experience to do once but it’s expensive. I purchased online for the discount and the family price was still $89. The team operator was interesting and provided useful info. We did not get any waffles at the top but they smelled good. The top is windy and 20 degrees cooler than Jackson Hole so take a jacket or sweatshirt.
269,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Family,"Indianapolis, IN ",WOW!!,"It's expensive. Probably too expensive, but we are glad we went.  Beautiful views at the top. Para gliders, trails to hike, snack shack. Drinks and waffles. Very good!!"
270,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Warminster, PA ",Great way to start a Jackson Hole vacation,Views of the Grand Tetons were spectacular and at the top it was fun to watch the para gliders take off. Waffles at the top are worth buying. Take plenty of water up with you because a bottle of water at the top is about $5! Be sure to also ride the mini tram up which is nearby -separate ride up to a different location. Gets you closer to the ground and any wild life. One ticket pays for both which was a nice surprise to us because we did not know that when buying the tickets. Buy tickets on line before you go. Saves you about $5 a ticket!
271,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Family,"Lawton, MI ",WhattaView,"Our love of Jackson Hole rose to a whole new level from the vantage point of Rendezvous Mountain. It helps get the area in perspective. Warm clothes and binoculars were helpful. Some of our group ate waffles, others who weren't hungry enjoyed the smells. Some took a 3 mile hike to take the gondola down. Others just looked around and took the tram back down. We saw a black bear and a napping moose on the way down. Just glimpses. This is absolutely a must-do for this area."
272,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018,not available,"Aumsville, OR ",Great View,"My husband & I took a ride on the JH Aerial Tram. It was a beautiful day, as well as a beautiful view. You can see the beautiful Tetons every direction, as well as the town. I would recommend taking a bottle of water with you, if you plan to stay up at the top very long. The food was a bit pricey, bottled water was $5, which I felt was a little steep. I would definitely recommend taking the tram."
273,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Memphis, TN ",Summer Vacation in Jackson Hole,"I go to Jackson Hole often. I love taking the Tram up to the top of the mountains! It about a 12 minute ride up and down the mountain. The views are amazing! You can eat at the top of the mountain. Waffles only in this little shack of a restaurant. It's so much fun! This should be at the top of your list to do when visiting the area. It is located in Teton Village which is about 15 to 20 minutes from Jackson Hole in Wilson, WY."

On the way up our guide/operator pointed out a bear in the shadow of the trees. We walked the ski trails down and around to the tram (last mile uphill), about 4 miles. Great views of flowers, meadows, and mountain sceneries. We spotted a Marmot on the side of the trail and many butterflies and grasshopper."
279,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Richmond, VA ",Rendezvous Peak!,"The aerial tram at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in the summer offers fantastic views of the Grand Teton, and the beautiful valley below. If it is a little chilly, check into the waffle shack. The smell will hit you as you exit the tram at top, and it is hard to keep away. You may also get lucky to see a paraglider set up to glide down the mountain. You can ride the tram down or choose to hike back down."
280,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Oakton, VA ","Gorgeous views, great tram operators/guides",Took the tram up this summer - takes 12 minutes each way. Guides were funny and informative. Great photo opps. It's a little pricey but order online in advance to save - you can do so the same day. There's also a family package that's worth it if you have 2 or more kids.
281,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Glorieta, NM ",Great option for last day in Grand Teton,"We recently visited Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. While in the Tetons, we had planned a hike to Taggert Lake but discovered the parking lot at the trail head was full and cars were parked for a quarter mile in each direction on the park’s main road. We decided to bag the hike and go to Teton Village. We bought tickets for the aerial trams and ski lift. We rode the chairlift over the mountain bike trail, took the Bridger gondolas to the restaurant on top of the mountain where we enjoyed lunch and panoramic views of Jackson Hole. We topped it off with the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. It was a nice way to spend the afternoon and enjoy beautiful vistas of the Jackson Hole area. This was totally unplanned, but ended up salvaging our day. By late afternoon, we headed back to our camp site and found the Taggert Lake parking lot had emptied out, so we stopped and took the hike planned for earlier in the day. The day ended up being a winner for our last day in the Tetons. We are used to traveling during the off season when crowds are smaller, but by being flexible we discovered something we had not planned and had a great day."
282,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Zionsville, IN ",Do it,Great views and trails at top. Teton Village is very nice. Hard to image coming to Jackson Hole and not riding the tram.
283,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Greatness,If you have 2 kids or more then you can get a family ticket price. Worth every penny. The ride was amazing!!
284,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Solo,"Utopia, TX ",Beautiful vistas,Wonderful ride up and back. Breathtaking views. Well run operation. Would recommend this activity for the whole family.
285,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Lincoln City, OR ",A must do!,"If you are visiting the Jackson Hole Resort, this is a must do! Buy your tickets on-line for a discount, or clip a coupon from the local paper. Great views from the top. There is a lot of area at the top to walk around, pretty easy walk, and I would recommend you do that because you will get differing views (compared to just looking around from where the tram lets you off). As expected, stand at the front window going up and down for best moving ascending//descending views."
286,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Burlington, VT ",A must do if you are in Jackson Hole,"We rode the Tram to the top and hiked the Rock Springs Trail. The ride is smooth, the view is breathtaking, and the hiking was amazing. We did several hikes in the Teton and Yellowstone area and this was my favorite hike. The hiking map was a little unclear and there are a few spots along the trail that could have used trail signs (especially when the trail is covered in snow) but that really did not take away from our experience. We visited the waffle house since the reviews indicated that they were amazing, we felt that they were just ok and it would have been better to bring our own lunch or eat at the base before our hike."
287,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Redwood City, CA, ",Great way to see Valley,"Took the tram ride to the top and got a great view of the valley. Ride was very smooth, except for the bumps when crossing the support pole exchange. Not much seating but plenty of space to take great pictures. The top is well worth the ride."
288,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Baltimore, MD ",Accessibility and inclusivity should be a priority.,"When I bought the tickets in person, I told the agent I had two senior citizens (age 85+) with me. That would have been an EXCELLENT time for her to mention the massive amount of stairs on the main access as well as the elevator alternative that is in the OPPOSITE direction! But she said nothing and we stupidly trusted the “tram” signs.    We walked our less-mobile family in the direction of those signs and found an extensive ramp that certainly implies full accessibility. But after going almost all the way, we turned the corner and encountered two huge sets of stairs. Ridiculous. We had no choice but to go forward on those stairs or go all the way back down to the bottom for the elevator. Neither was a good choice.    It would be SO easy for them to post handicap access signs or to simply be proactive at the ticket desk. And each team car should have signs for handicapped seating as well. At an average $40 per ticket, 50 people per car, and 4 cars per hour, they’re pulling in more than $50k a day (and that’s BEFORE you factor in the outrageous food and drink prices up top). For that much money, I expected better.    It’s worth complaining too about the price of water up top: $5 a bottle? The same price as beer?! And why would the sodas be cheaper than the water? Highway robbery. And fix the stall doors in the bathroom. It’s not too much to expect them to stay closed while you’re relieving yourself."
289,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Bethlehem, PA ",Breath Taking,"Having had tram rides before in Vermont and New Hampshire the Aerial ride in Jackson was great. Ascending up the mountain and stopping at the top, (10,400 ft ) the sights below are breath taking. At the top it was quite windy but it was a bright sunny day which just made for a perfect experience. At the top they have a snack shack where you can get waffles and various other snacks including wine and beer."
290,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Omaha, NE ","Awesome, but expensive","We took advantage of the free tram rides at Jackson Hole on the Bridger Gondola after 5:00 pm. It was a very warm day at the bottom of the hill but it was much cooler when we got to the top. It was a perfect day with great visibility so we could see the entire valley. The view is worth the ride. However, when we got to the top we wanted to get something to drink. We ended up spending $25 for 2 soft drinks, a small thing of pretzels and some M&M's. So be aware that the free ride is great but plan to pay at the top. We would do it again but bring our own snacks."
291,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Phoenixville, PA ",On our list to do every year!,What’s not to love (unless petrified of heights). Six summers in a row we’ve taken the tram to the top of Rendevous. We love taking a hike down the crest of the hill and finding remnants of snow from the winter season. Nothing like snow angels or a snowball fight in July! Of course views 360 degrees are majestic and spectacular!
292,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018,not available,"Boulder, CO ",Great view - good waffles,Fun diversion with beautiful views and delicious waffles. Very family friendly. Active folks can hike up and ride the tram down for free.
293,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family, ,Great Views,"My son and I took the tram up the mountain one afternoon. The views were tremendous. The ride up and down was great, too. You'll want to buy your tickets online, rather than at the window. You'll save money."
294,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Jersey City, NJ ",Great Views...Snow in July!!!,"Thought the price point was high, but did enjoy the ride, the views, and the hikes around the tram. And making a snowball in July was fun!"
295,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Dallas, TX ","Breathtaking view, a little expensive.",The view is incredible though it may be expensive for big families such as ours. The kids were scared going up in the giant cart but when they got to the top everyone was all smiles
296,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family, ,Do not miss it!,"We had a great time. The views are spectacular. The tram pilots are engaging. A smooth ride to the top, spend some time soaking in the beauty of the mountains and valley, have a waffle, and a smooth ride back down."
297,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Madisonville, TX ",GOD IS SUCH AN ARTIST!,"The views from the top of the mountain are breath takingly BEAUTIFUL! The tram guy was very funny! My favorite line was referring to how he knew the cows in the field where the best He said, "" they were OUT STANDING in their field, so they must be the best!"
298,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Pittsburgh, PA, ",Fast and easy way to the top,"If you are looking for some great views, maybe a waffle and the easiest way to the top than this is the place. We used the family pass to save a few bucks. Got to the top had a waffle and then hiked down the mountain via Summer Road-to Wild Flower. During the winter in is running skiers to the top and is much more crowded"
299,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Tucson, AZ ",Great view,Great views of Teton Village! The ride up was great and you can see some wildlife during the ride. Quite nice at the top but prettychilly even in July.
300,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Melbourne, Australia ",Best view in town,Have ridden this tram car several times on previous visit and did once again. Great facility with very modern tram car which is just a engineering feet. The ride is smooth and quite quick to the top where the real view of the entire area is experienced. A must do when coming to the area
301,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,Ohio ,Free rides after 5:00 lead to great views,"We spend the late afternoon in Teton Village, enjoying the kids playground and activities (rock wall, jumping). We all enjoyed watching the mountain bikers work their way down the hills as well. Capped off our visit with an evening tram ride up to the top and a quick snack & drinks on the patio."
302,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018,not available, ,"Wow,what a ride",The views going up and down were amazing. The tram gives everyone a great view since it's windows are all around you. It was more crowded on the way down since it was the final trip. The whole valley was just all laid out before you. Highly recommend this ride.
303,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Kingwood, TX ",Something to do,We took the tram to the to top of Rendezvous Mountain. The ride was enjoyable and the view was good looking down on Jackson Hole (can't see the town of Jackson itself). It was very windy and cold at the top and we didn't stay outside very long. There's a little building and restrooms where we got some hot chocolate before we headed down. We were looking for something to do for a couple of hours and this fit the bill. Pretty expensive however.
304,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States ",AMAZING SIGHTS,"This was so much fun! The TEAM was professional, friendly and knowledgeable! When we got to the top, it was super windy and cold. When we got off, we could smell something sweet in the air. To our happy surprise, there is a little bakery up there that makes delicious waffles and hot chocolate .. perfect for the spot!!!!!"
305,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family, ,Awesome!,We loved this experience and heading up the tram after 5 pm was free! It’s about a 20 minute round trip ride if you don’t get off at the top. We did disembark and enjoyed dinner at the top. Views were amazing!
306,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Trussville, AL ",Enjoyed the trip,We had a wonderful experience. Highly recommended to all that are planning to visit. Can’t wait to to go back in the fall.
307,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Friends,"Bayfield, CO ",Worth it,"Although it is quite expensive, the tram ride was absolutely worth it. The views are breathtaking and it’s truly a unique experience. It is very smooth and we all felt quite safe and secure."
308,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,Maryland ,Must do activity if staying at Grand Teton National Park,"Jackson Hole Aerial Tram during the summertime is a must do! We were staying inside Grand Teton NP and needed something fun to do. After the Snake River Float trip, the guide mentioned the Tram. Jackson Hole is located off the inner park road and if you get off at Moose Wilson Road, its a straight shot there. Beware, the road has a section of gravel only. Many people have seen wildlife (Moose) along the road, but we didn't see any. The Tram family pass was $89 (save $8) if you book online. Valid for a full day of unlimited tram rides. The Tram carries 100 people and runs every 15 minutes. We had to wait about 30 minutes because of the crowds. It's about a 10 minute ride to the top of Rendevous Mountain. Once you get there the view is excellent. That day we were there because of the clouds, we had to wait 30 minutes before they could take us down again."
309,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Nine Mile Falls, WA ",Good ride but pricey,Be sure to buy your ticket on line to save money. Your ticket allows you to ride the gondola as well. It should not cost 35.00 to ride.
310,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"O'Fallon, MO ",Something different to do,"We roads the tram and the gondolas. Fun experience for all of us. Beautiful view and saw a bear when we were on the gondola. Don’t forget to bring layers. We saw a couple with shorts and T-shirt’s only, and they were quite cold when we got to 10,450 ft on the tram!"
311,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Ringgold, GA ",Great!,"This is certainly a not-to-missed ride to the top of Rendezvous peak! The trip is fast, smooth, and the view at the top is incredible. Go!"
312,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Blown away!,"I titled this ""blown away"" because that's what happened at the top of the mountain! The wind was so strong the day we went, I thought we were going to be blown off the mountain! That was the only reason I gave this four instead of five stars. The tram ride itself was great. Your ticket will get you multiple rides the same day, if you so desire."
313,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2018 , Family,"Seymour, CT ",Very cool experience,A must when visiting the Village. Breath taking views and an easy and relaxing ride to the summit. Even non thrill seekers will enjoy the ride. See great views and get out at the top and grab a hot chocolate or t shirt at the gift shop.
314,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Waycross, GA ",Do not miss this!!!,"This was an awesome ride to 10,500 feet!! It was beautiful and not scary as I thought it would be! The views from the top is wonderful! Do not miss this trip---so worht the cost!"
315,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Colleyville, TX ","You can see forever, on the top of the world.","This is a must if you are visiting the area. It is the only way short of a helicopter that you will see this view at this height. In June there is still snow pack. The ride up is comfortable and the trams run regularly up and down. On the top of the mountain there is the world famous ""cabin"" where they serve delicious waffles, warm drinks and beer, among other options. There is a 360 fantastic view of the area. Hikes are available, but take a map if you are going the 7 pulse trek down.    Don't bypass the opportunity."
316,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples, ,Amazing.... worth every penny!,The view is worth the time and money!!!!    The tram operators are knowledgeable and friendly! Glad to answer any question!!    My pictures cannot do the view or experience justice!
317,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018,not available,"Earlysville, VA ","Honestly, we had not planned on doing this. Glad we did.","We began our packed week in Yellowstone. 10 hour days. So, for Jackson, I arranged for a morning safari and a sunset float. I assumed we would ant to spend the remaining time in Jackson wandering and relaxing. Well, I am delighted that we took the time to take the tram up It takes 30 minutes up and back and as much time as you wish to stay while up there. It's a beautiful view, you learn a few more tid-bits about the area, and you can get some wonderful photographs. We celebrated a milestoone anniversary while on vacation, and we had someone click a photo of us at Artists Point at the Yellowstone Canyon. It wasn't nearly as good as the one we took up on the Teton. Go!"
318,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,SC ,Get on top of the world!,"It costs a lot of $$ but when you reach the top of the 10,450 ft mountain it is very cold but mind bogglingly awesome in the true original sense of the word. The view for us on this cold day was for miles and miles. There is a cafe/bar on top but we got their late so production of waffles had stopped. Worth your $$ and time. Note it is not in Jackson you have to go Teton village."
319,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,Mississippi Gulf Coast ,Awesome view!,Definitely worth the trip to the top of the mountain.... and what a view! Take advantage of using your pass for all 3 tram rides. Great and fun ride!
320,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Henderson, KY ",Great ride!,"Exciting ride to the top of the mountain. The views were stunning! There was a cafe to purchase waffles, coffee, and drinks to enjoy."
321,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Couples,Tallahassee ,Beautiful views,"This is a comfortable aerial tram with nice commentary on the way and down the mountain. Once you are at the top, you take in the views and can visit the Corbin's Cabin to buy waffles and a beverage (recommended). The views are beautiful, as you would expect. Spend as much or as little time there as you like."
322,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family, ,Top of the mountain,"Although this seemed a bit pricey at first, after we went up with our 7 and 10 year old children, it seemed like the way to go. We would have never made it to the top of a mountain otherwise. The view was amazing! And being that we weren't around long enough to acclimate to high altitudes the team gave us an opportunity to stand on top of the mountain! Team operators were very knowledgeable and able to answer all our questions. We even stopped in to have waffles while on top. There is a trail to hike back to the bottom, if you are so inclined. We chose not to, as we had a whiny 7 year old with us. I do like that the tram ticket is good for the whole day."
323,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Oklahoma City, United States ",Fun Ride,Loved the ride up to the top of the mountain. What I really like is being able to go up as many times as we like. We went up in the morning for waffles and then again in the afternoon/
324,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Glenwood, IA ",Great view of the valley!,"Was here on a group visit. Took the tram to the top to the Waffle House. Beautiful views of the entire valley. Although the tickets were prepaid via our group, I am not sure that it was really worth the price for the only thing we did was spend a few minutes viewing the valley and about 20 minutes in the waffle house."
325,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017,not available,"Fort Smith, MT ",A view of a lifetime!,"Watching for moose if you are lucky as you make your way up the Mountain to over 10,m000 feet. The view is memorable and you can walk around up top in the other seasons but it is still cold. So take a jacket. Not to be missed it and very worth the cost to use the Tram."
326,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Council Bluffs, IA ",Exhilarating!,Oh my gosh that was so much fun and totally worth the time and effort. The ride in the tram was smooth and comfortable. The views were stunning. I highly recommend this activity!
327,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018,not available,Wilmington NC ,Great views and better waffles,"We rode the tram up to the top on a glorious, clear day. The views were spectacular. They say the car will hold 100 people during ski season, but I wouldn't want to find out personally. Maybe 35 people in our car and it was comfortable. Be sure to stop in and have a waffle. (Not included in tram price). I am not a huge fan of waffles but these were absolutely delicious. Split the lemon with whipped cream with my husband, and we fought for the last bites."
328,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",Rendezvous Mountain Grandeur,"So. The round trip lift ticket for summer is $38 walk-on price. Nothing is inexpensive at Jackson Hole. But this is a bargain!    The views from the top are breath taking and it’s why Jackson Hole is a world class destination. It doesn’t matter whether you ski or not, a tram ride to the top of Rendezvous Mountain gives you the thrill of being on the Teton Crest.    Watching the paragliding is mesmerizing. Views of the Snake River and Jackson Hole are fantastic. The Teton Crest includes being able to see the top of Grand Teton.    Bring a jacket for the breezy conditions on top. Savor the view we could only dream of prior to the tram. Sit and soak for an hour and be awed!"
329,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Galena, OH ",Welcome to the Top of the World!,"I hate trams! But must admit, this was very smooth and the view - while frightening for a person like me with a fear of heights - was amazing! I am so glad I went up. This is a very well run and modern tram system - I don't know how they made it but it is fantastic!"
330,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018,not available,"Keene, KY ",So fun for all!,"Our family of 5 all loved the smooth ride to the summit! We enjoyed the cd played on the way up that gave great information about the area. The views from the top were wonderful (and cold!), but worth it! The tram workers were all kind and professional and made our experience even better. The waffles at the top were awesome!! A must do experience!"
331,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family,"Riverside, CA ",Outstanding views but very cold,"We recently took our family group to the top of the tram. First, the cashier was very helpful. When we showed him we were unable to purchase the family package on line along with the 6 adult tickets we were purchasing he gave us the online price for the whole group. (You will save buying online). The weather was partly cloudy but very windy which meant temps in the 20's at the top. The view was remarkable and made the cost worth it. You can check the web cam online for the current view at the top before you buy your tickets. If the view is full of clouds wait until another time."
332,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Newark, DE ",Great views from the top!,"My family was staying in Teton Village in early June, so we went up on the first aerial tram on Sunday morning at 9am. Note we pre-purchased adult and senior tickets online to save on ticket prices fairly significantly (~$7 each). When we arrived at the ticket window all I had to do was show my ID to pick up our wrist bands. The ride up takes 12 minutes and provides great views (and commentary) on the mountain and surrounding area. At the top, there is a viewing platform and just steps away is Corbet's Cabin which has drinks and waffles, perfect for a cold, windy day at the top! We were excited to do some hiking on the trails at the top, but quickly found the area snow packed and in fact our aerial tram had several skiers and snowboarders! We were able to walk a ways down the summit trail and then turned around. We still had a great time and the trip was definitely worth it, but if you're interested in hiking early in the season, this is not possible. Note at the top there were also people offering paragliding down to the valley below, so if you're interested that is definitely available too."
333,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Chapel Hill, NC ",It it what it is - a tram to a great view,"There isn’t that much to say about the Aerial Tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain from Teton Village. It’s a comfortable ride, takes about 12 minutes, on a clear day offers *tremendous* views of Jackson Hole and the environs, and it’s pretty expensive. Trams depart every 15 minutes. We’re glad we went. If you’re a skier (I am), it reminds you of many other mountain tops on which you’re dumped when there’s snow on the ground. For my non-skiing wife, it was a bit more special. I wouldn’t go, however, if there’s any compromise to visibility. The view’s the thing..."
334,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Family, ,Beautiful views and hikes,The tram is a great way for all ages to see the views from the top of Jackson Hole resort. We would have liked to hike down from the top but we ran out of days on our trip! It is much colder at the top so dress appropriately.
335,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Couples,Pennsylvania ,Worth the price,"Visited while staying in downtown Jackson. 20 minute bus ride to Teton Village ($3). Cost for tram varies based on season/age. ($30-40). We were given wristbands and could ride all day. View from summit is great. Pick a clear, calm day if possible."
336,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Pensacola, FL ",Takes you to the top!,"Best way to get to the top of the mountain. Enjoy a coffee and a waffle at Corbet's, walk around some of the trails then take the easiest route back down the mountain."
337,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018,not available,Kent ,Brilliant experience!,"This is an amazing trip up to over 11,000ft in the Grand Tetons - I am pretty rubbish at heights but it was so smooth even at the pylon passes. We went when it was very quiet - only 10 or so in our tram - apparently they hold 100!  It really is worth booking on line to save money. We watched the cloud from our hotel and when we saw it was going to clear, we booked online and ten minutes later were on the tram. The views are just jaw dropping - worth every penny."
338,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Business, ,A must do in Jackson Hole!,"Beautiful, panoramic views of the Teton Mountains and surrounding valleys. Save room for waffles at the mountain top snack bar with the best views anywhere!"

342,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Friends,"Longueuil, Canada ","Spectacular, but a bit expensive","Nice and spectacular ride, but maybe a bit expensive when you are many for going only to the top. Of course, later in the season you also have access to the gondolas and maybe then it's a good price, but in May. Apart from that, a must."
343,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Couples,"Delray Beach, Florida, United States ",Nothing Short Of Spectacular!,"For me, this was an experience of a lifetime. This is a must do! Access to the mountain top and views that you can get no other way. Beyond beautiful. The hot apple cider at Corbe'ts Cabin was amazing. Did not try the waffles but they smelled out of this world delicious! I will never forget it."
344,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Couples,"Raleigh, North Carolina ",A must do!,"We loved the Tetons! However, we couldn't hike very much do to access and ability.

346,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Couples,"Lake Wales, FL ",Fantastic,"This is the easiest way to get to the top of the world. Comfortable tram, great views and a speedy ascent. We were lucky to be visiting here just a few days after this opened for the season. The views from the top are great. If you're lucky there will be paragliders taking off from the top of the mountain...some tandem....wow. Stop by the gift shop at the top and have an $8 waffle...all in all a great experience."
347,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Couples,"Chandler, AZ ",Great views,"The ride was smooth and the views were amazing. Waffles and hot cocoa at the top were good, too. Can't imagine what this would be like when it was busy season."

I went up and was so glad I did. Gorgeous scenery for miles, the whole Jackson Hole is visible! There was still skiing going on up at the top here in May. There is a small cafe up there that specializes in Waffles! They also sell alcohol limited to Irish Whiskey & Baileys type."

350,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017,not available,"New York City, NY ",Good transportation--just a little too expensive on the day we went!,"My son in law booked us tickets on the Aerial Tram--a conveyance holding about 100 persons and taking us up to the top of Rendezvous Mountain--a hugely popular ski area with some very challenging trails by reputation (but we weren't there to ski; it was midAugust and we wanted the most unobstructed view of the total eclipse on August 21, 2017. The tram ride was about 10-12 minutes and took us about a mile upward (elevation about 10,800 feet). During the ride, we got a wonderful birds eye view of the Jackson Hole environs and as a bonus, we could see the partial eclipse start while we were cued up to board. Everything went smoothly as silk..boarding and unboarding great in both directions. As a bonus--ability to view environs for 50-75 miles in every direction so that the eclipse was mind boggling. I'm sure that skiers have thrills in the winter, but perhaps not so electric as those few minutes. Of course, the tram prices were much higher for this particular ride, but we all thought that this one time it was worth it."
351,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2018 , Family,"New Bern, NC, ",Closed today,We were disappointed to find that the tram was closed today as was most of the village. Afterward we were told by our concierge in Jackson that things there wouldn’t ramp up again until Memorial Day. This is heavily advertised in the brochures and we did not see anything saying that it would be closed in May.
352,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2018 , Friends,Atlanta ,Jackson Hole Aerial Tram,"You can ski to your hearts content or until your legs give out! Awesome Tram, takes you from the bottom of the mountain all the way to the Tip Top! Couldn't ask for more!"
353,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2018 , Family,Alabama ,Smooth ride,"Smooth and beautiful ride up to the top. Pricey at $33 for a non-skier's pass, but worth it. Be prepared for gale force winds and frigid temperatures (in March, at least) when you get to the top, and pay attention to the closing time for the snack shop at the top. We left on one of the last trips up and missed the snack shop by just a few minutes. No waffles for us, but the views more than made up for it!"
354,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2018 , Family,Florida ,Loads of Fun and Awesome View,"We did the tram as sightseers and you really get mixed in with the skiers but it’s cool cuz it’s such a fun experience. Get a spot right at the window. These full up fast with a max of 100 passengers. It’s about a 8-10 minutes ride to the mountain top and well worth it. Beautiful scenery, and even more beautiful at the summit. Be sure to get some hot chocolate and waffles at the top. Best hot choc I’ve ever had!"
355,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2018 , Friends,"atlanta, United States ",Way too crowded,I am not a fan of tight quarters and they jam you in like sardines in the tram. And most days you have to wait WAY too long. Certainly not as good a system as the trams I have ridden at other ski resorts
356,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2018 , Family,"New York City, NY ",fast to the top!,Take the tram to get to the top of the mountain for spectacular views and yummy waffles! There's a tram every 9 minutes and it's a beautiful and efficient ride.
357,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2018 , Business,"Oviedo, FL ",crowded but a great view at the top!,"A must do! Whether the summer, fall, winter or spring, the view at the top is stunning. There is a waffle restaurant up top that smelled delicious!"
358,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2018 , Couples,"Birmingham, AL ",Fun ride to the top...ate lunch and had drinks at the bar! People watching...,Just home from Jackson Hole trip. We took an afternoon and went to Teton Village. Took the gondola up to the restaurant and bar to eat lunch and have drinks.  Enjoyed the people watching...beautiful afternoon!
359,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Friends,"Reston, VA ",To the Top!,"Join up with 99 of your closest friends for a quick trip up to massive snow fields.  With 100 riders loading in every ten minutes, the line moves pretty quickly.  We skied during a popular week, with an average of 5"" of fresh per day and never had to wait more than two tram loads to move into boarding position.  The ""Conductors"" always play good mix tapes to get you in the mood for a great run.  The views of the Tetons to the North and the Couloirs to the South are breathtaking.  ""If you don't know, don't go."""
360,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Friends,"Columbus, OH ",Fun trip to the top!,"Just returned from our trip to Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. We took the tram to the top of Rendezvous Bowl. The ticket price was included in our ski pass, so no additional cost if you are skiing or boarding. The runs at the top are for experts only. All black or double black at the very top. There are a few blue runs, but only reachable from a black or double blacks. They do warn everyone that this particular mountain peak is for experts only. If you are not an expert skier they advise you to ride the tram back down. The line moves pretty quickly as it accommodates 100 people and their skis or snowboards. It is however a very tight squeeze. Everyone is packed in shoulder to shoulder. Definitely not for those that are claustrophobic. Once the doors shut, you really can’t move too much and you become close friends with those that were strangers minutes earlier. Unless you are standing near the windows you can’t really see anything. It takes about 10 minutes to reach the top. We rode it twice and the second time we were lucky enough to be near the window. There was good visibility that day and took in some great views of the mountain."
361,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2018 , Friends,"Annapolis, MD, ",100 person Tram at Jackson Hole!,"They squeeze 100 people into this tram that takes u to the summit at 10450 feet  A decent amount of non skiiers use this to just see the summit and go to Corbets Cabin which has $6 waffles and drinks and views for days.  Maybe a 10 min ride up probably less maybe 8 mins fast with amazing views. U get crowded in like squeezed in but that's what u have to do.  Trails after are amazing u can just to the black diamond to blues which are easy to get down, but awesome trails which go for ever."
362,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Family, ,Nice way to check out the mountain,Nice way to get back down after a long hike from the base .Beautiful views of the entire valley. Would highly recommend.
363,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Couples, ,Famous tram,"This tram takes you up into the Teton mountains, awesome resort, but really the most hype is concentrated on the backcountry terrain. We had a great time exploring some of the Jackson terrain and it lived up to it’s reputation."
364,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Family,"Moorpark, CA ",A 10 minute ride with great views of Teton area and mountain,Only issue I had was it took an hour to get up to the summit and it was snowing hard and windy. Not worth going up unless you can ski down the black diamond run at top which is OK if snow is soft as they do not groom. They do have good waffles and hot ciders and hot chocolate at top in winter. It took 90 minutes as I came back down because of weather but views are spectacular.
365,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Friends,"Avondale Estates, GA ",Go get a waffle!,"Even if you don't ski the black diamonds, get to the resort 30 minutes before opening and take the first tram up to Corbett's Cabin. Order a waffle, grab a seat, and take in the magnificent view from 10,450 feet. Then, take the tram down and spend the rest of the day on the Magic Carpet! :-)"
366,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Couples, ,Get on before 2:45 pm for sightseeing,"If you're not planning to ski down from the top, make sure you're in line for the tram by 2:30 p.m. The tram closes at 4 p.m. and that will give you enough time to ride up, take pictures, and ride back down. The restaurant at the top closes at 3 p.m., so if you want waffles you need to be there before that. The view is incredible and worth the packed tram ride."
367,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Solo,"Farmington Hills, MI ",A thrill for skiers,4000 ft vertical rise above the mountain resort in Teton Village...that’s how high you go with 99 other crazy skiers for a thrill of a ride with majestic views for hundreds of miles and then cones the black Rendevous Bowl...tough but fun skiing in one of the best skiing resorts in the US...don’t miss it
368,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Hammond, LA ",WHAT A VIEW!,"Don't miss this experience! Go up and have waffles and a hot drink! Even though we are not skiers, was one of the highlights of the trip!"
369,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Family, ,Stop at Tetons Village,We visited on a snowy day and he village was packed with skiers and snowboarders. The wait for the trams and lifts was very long. A beautiful place to visit and a good place for skiers.
370,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Friends,"New York City, NY, ",Take the tram to the top for a wild ride down!!,This famous tram goes all the way to the top in about 12 minutes! It fit 100 people..packed like sardines. But it goes by quick. And there is music. And you need to get psyched up to get down the diamonds and double diamonds. There is Corbet waffle cabin at the top. And awesome views of the hole on a clear day.
371,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Auburn, AL ",Top of the Mountain breakfast,This is great activity for the whole family. We chose the early time to catch the unique breakfast on top of the tram line. Great. Views were fabulous.
372,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Couples, ,Expensive but worth it!,"If you are riding the tram during ski season and you are not skiing, note that this is the same tram that takes experienced skiers to the top of the mountain at 10k feet. So they really cram a lot of people in the tram on the way up. If you are trying to get good pictures, get next to the window, otherwise you won’t be able to see at all due to the amount of people on the tram. The fun part is when you get to the top of the mountain. Note: it’s a huge temp drop at the top, so be sure to wear extra layers.The view is beautiful and there’s a cabin serving waffles there. Also we usually get altitude sickness but thankfully didn’t this time because we brought some oxygen canisters and used them while going up (it’s a 4,000 climb in 12 min). The price was steep at $33 each and parking was $20 but it was worth it just for the ride down. There were only 5 of us riding down (as opposed to being crammed on the way up). The ride down was fun and the view was fantastic. Worth the price for the views!!"
373,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Family,"Denver, CO ",Waffles at the top worth the wait!,"We waited about 35 minutes to ride the tram on a Saturday in February. The line went out to the merchantile. Loved the views of Corbets, waffles at Corbets Cabin and snow ghosts at the top. It is expert terrain. Half of my family skied down Rendezvous Bowl and my youngest and I rode back down to catch some more blues."
374,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2018 , Family,"White Lake, MI ",Worth the wait,Only way to get to the top of Rendezvous Bowl and Corbets. The wait looks worse than it is. The wait probably averaged 30 minutes during the weekdays we were there. Believe it holds 100 skiers and is not packed like some large trams I have been on in Europe.
375,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Scottsburg, IN ",Best ever,"We really enjoyed the area, we recommend you take the tram to the top. Don't get distracted on the way up. You will miss something below you."
376,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2018 , Friends,"Madison, WI ",Jackson 2018,"Probably one of the best mountains I’ve ever ridden when it comes to terrain and variety of experience. Once you get to know the area, you have thee options. Ride Jackson, Teton pass , or grand targhee. After a snowfall, Jackson is only good for a day ( unless you’re willing to hike inbounds), Grand targhee is good for 48 hours, and sometimes gets snow when Jackson doesn’t ( check mountain weather.com). If all else fails , the pass is always fun. Take turns driving other up, or take s nice long run down glory bowl. There’s always snow, sometimes you have to work for it."
377,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2018 , Friends,"Oxnard, CA ",The prices definitely takes you for a Ride! - January 2018,"The Aerial Tram at Jackson Hole takes you all the way to the top which is at an elevation of 10,450 ft (3190 m). It takes about 9 minutes to get there (base elevation is 6,311 ft/1,924 m) along the 12,463 ft (3,799 m) length.    Skiers/boarders with a lift ticket can use the tram to access the backcountry areas, a couple bowls, and a lot of black runs. You can also buy an aerial pass to use the tram if you just want to go to the top for the view. Note: the top is usually much colder and usually windy so dress accordingly...you've been warned! That being said, everyone's packed in together on the tram. The few times that we used the tram, it was packed and unless you got in quickly to get next to the window, there's not much of a view because of all the people.    It's always nice to see things from above... as long as it's not a cloudy day. Personally, I didn't think the view from the top was all that great. I've also been on a couple other much nicer trams (Squaw Valley & Palm Springs). Maybe I've been spoiled and just seen too many good ones (views). So being available for use with my lift ticket, it's okay. But I wouldn't buy an aerial pass just to see the top view. Especially considering the price (varies by age, by the time of the year, and group size)...which is pure gouging in my opinion. Go online to see the prices. If I were wrong, I think they'd offer a money back guaranty if customers didn't feel the ride/view were worth the price...hey JH, challenge on!"
378,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2017 , Family,hollywood ,Tram,This was a non ski winter vacay. So the tram was a must do for us. Up to the summit. Stunning views. We ate at Waffle House. Pricey. Would recommend not eating there if not skiing. Eat at Rendezvous Restaurant instead .
379,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2018 , Friends, ,Great view and amazing skiing here,"Five stars . Great staff, great powder , some of the best skiing ever. Highly recommend if you are a beginner or a pro."
380,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,___________ ,Cool experience for the whole family,"Instead of taking the tram, we took an early evening ride on the gondola (free from 5-9 PM). Same views, but a cozier ride in the smaller cars."
381,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2018 , Family,"Medford, NJ ",Take the tram!!,"Even if you are not a skier take a ride on the tram for spectacular views of the Teton Range and mountains surrounding Jackson Hole. In winter or summer, take a ride up to Corbet's cabin for a unique breakfast of rolled pancakes. Rustic but very unique. You will feel like you found a treasure very few will ever discover."
382,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2017 , Couples,"Milton Keynes, UK ",Aerial tram - Awesome,"This is a must do when in JH. We got to the mountain resort just before 9am as this is when the tram starts running. It was a beautiful, if not freezing day, clear skies. We joined the queue just after 9am, we had to wait about 20mins before we got to ride up, we were crammed in, but it’s less than 10mins to get to the top. From stepping out at the top, the views were breathtaking. Worth the money to get the views, simply stunning. The waffles at Corbet’s Cabin are a must and a hot choc to warm up before going back outside to take in the views. As we only went up to get the vista, once all the skiers/snow boarders had set off, we could wander around taking snaps without having to fight for a view. We timed it well going up on a clear day, definitely worth the money. As we weren’t hitting the slopes we didn’t spend long up the top, as it was soooo cold that day, but we got some great pics.."
383,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,Carlsbad ,Family of Five loved this part of our visit -- tram free and restaurant food was great,We took the tram up to restaurant for dinner and spotted wild life both going up and going down which added to the fun. View at the top was awesome and food and drinks fit the mood well. Loved the ambiance!
384,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2017 , Family,"Orlando, FL ",Went first thing in the morning and enjoyed waffles!,"We took our two kids (ages 7 & 9) up the Jackson Hole aerial tram. We went right at 9am, and there was a very short line. The tram can hold about a hundred people, and it takes about 9 minutes to reach the top. There are two trams that run next to each other. The views were gorgeous at the top. We stopped by Corbet’s Cabins for waffles before taking the tram back down. Definitely glad we made time to take the tram up and grab some delicious waffles before a day of skiing!    Tip: I would try to go as soon as it opens if you can. By the time we got back down, the line was definitely much more crowded!"
385,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2017 , Friends,"Denver, CO ",Easy ride but crowded!,Squeezed like sardines into the tram after waiting for a bit. Well worth the ride. Absolutely breathtaking views at the top. And can't forget about the runs from up there! Must go!
386,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2017 , Couples,"Rigby, ID ",WOW JUST WOW,Amazing views. Awesome at the top! Worth EVERY penny! This was a trip I won't forget because of this Tram!!
387,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Fabulous Sightseeing OR Skiing!,"One of the top, if not THE top tram in the US. >4K vertical feet. Views for dozens of miles and mountain ranges. Views over the Snake River plains below and buttes north/west of Jackson. View of the airport from high up. Saw 2 grizzlies under the tram when on it in September earlier this year. Bring jackets almost any time of year, especially in summer as it is easily 20-30deg cooler at top. Definitely a top attraction beyond the 2 national parks & wildlife sightseeing."
388,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Camarillo, CA, ",Alternative to climbing the mountain,"Alternative to climbing the mountain. Sure, I’m going to climb the mountain! I read about complaints about the cost. This is a once in a lifetime experience. Definitely worth every dollar.the view going up and from the top are incredible.    Recommendation, budget for the ride, or simply splurge. It’s a great ride."
389,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Denver, CO ",Stunning Views!,"This is worth the price! Absolutely stunning views!! We went in July and it was freezing and very windy at the top, so we didn't stay all that long, but it was worth it!!"
390,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Prince George, Virginia ",Great views,We went on a Sunday after it snowed. It was foggy when we started. About half way up we broke through the clouds and had spectacular views of the Grand Teton Mountain rance. It had snowed the day before which made it that muck more beautiful.
391,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Solo,"Manhattan, KS ",Mountain Top Viewing,"A quick ride to the top of the mountain, you'll be able to overlook Jackson and the surrounding areas. When I was there, there were parasailers taking off from the mountain."
392,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Beverley, UK ",Amazing Views,"We had pre booked tickets for the Ariel Tram before we left home, and although when we first arrived in Teton Village it was cloudy so we decided to look round the Village first in the hope that they would clear! Lucky for us they did and boy what a view it was up Rendezvous Mountain, amazing, we had waffles at the small café at the top, I would definitely recommend them. What we hadn't realised when we bought our tickets was that it also covered the two other rides. One of which was a chair lift which was used mainly by people taking mountain bikes up and riding down, it was worth a go if only to watch the bikers. The other was a gondola which went up to the Bridger Restaurant, again the views where fantastic and by then it was so clear and we could see for miles."
393,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",Great experience but 30 bucks!,"It was a great experience, but I think 30 bucks is overpriced. We had a great weather that day so the view at the top was enjoyable. However except the view there is no much to see at the top. You can get expensive waffles but that's pretty much it. It was too late that day to hike down the mountain."
394,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2017 , Couples,Chislehurst England ,Don't miss this if the weather is clear,Expensive but worth it!  Fabulous views from the top. The cloud can roll in and obscure the view but in a clear day this should not be missed.  We visited just after early snow which was about a foot deep at the summit so check your footwear!  There is a coffee shop at the top
395,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2017 , Family,"Nashville, TN ",A Must-See In Jackson Hole,"Don't walk, run to get on this thing. The views are epic. Remember, there is a family pass for two adults and four children for one price!"
396,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2017 , Family,"Winona, MN ",Awesome Experience,My family loved the tram ride. Jackson Hole experienced early snow this year and when we reached the stop it was very windy and cold. Make sure you are prepared for conditions at the top. Great little cabin where you can get waffles and hot chocolate when you get there. Amazing views of the valley and we even saw moose. Highly recommended stop on our trip.
397,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017,not available,"Atlanta, GA ","Summer or Winter, a fun ride","I took the Aerial Tram in summer and it was a great way to get to the top to hike around; the cafe is nothing to write home about, but the cell service is awesome! The view heading back to Jackson Hole is enjoyable."
398,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Clinton, OH ",Outstanding Vistas,Dress for the weather. It was 32 degrees in mid-September and there ws snow on the ground (premature for the season) . got to appreciate the skiing potential of the area.
399,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Penn Valley, CA ",What a view you will feel like you are on top of the world,"The ride is well worth the trip. We bought our tickets online and saved $5 per tickets. The views were out of this world. The tram takes you to the 10,000 foot level."
400,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Greensburg, PA ",Coil views,Very neat. Fantastic views. Worth the $30/pp we paid end of September. Saw elk and deer on the way up. Small place to get a snack and souvenir at the peak.
401,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Los Gatos, CA ",Wonderful Experience,"My wife and I joined other couples in going up the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram in Teton Village. The Aerial Tram ride takes about 10 minutes one way and was running every 15 minutes when we were there. The top is Rendezvous mountain at roughly 10,400'. From the top, you get a phenomenal view of the entire Jackson Hole area, the Tetons, the Snake River Valley, Grand Teton National Park and the staggering summit of the Grand (Teton). We went in mid-September and there were no crowds or lines but a little snow on top. There is a small cafe (Corbet's Cabin) at the top. They are known for their waffles but sell other snacks and drinks. In addition to the amazing views, we saw moose and bears on the way down from the summit. They even slowed the tram to let us see the bears below us. A wonderful experience."
402,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Olmsted Falls, OH ",View,I'm terrified of heights but my boyfriend talked me into going on the tram. It was worth it. The view was wonderful from top to bottom. Wear a coat and good shoes because the top is slippery.
403,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Ballycastle, UK ",Dramatic,Loved our trip in the tram. It takes just 12 minutes to take you too over 10000 feet. It's a very smooth ride and the views are stunning. You may catch glimpses of wildlife as you make the ascent. It's cold on top so bring appropriate clothing. It's also glarey so bring sunglasses. Ts snowey so wear wslking shoes/boots. There's a cafe and toilets on the summit.  It's great fun.
404,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Kellyville, OK, ","Smooth Ride, Awesome Views","The tram ride takes about 10 minutes, with some narration, to the top. The ride is smooth with minimal rocking when passing the towers. The trams can be crowded, especially in the summer. Be prepared, the weather is much different at the top than it is in the village. When we were there, the temp at the top was about 57 degrees. There are hiking trails and a restaurant at the top. It feels like you can see forever up there, especially on a clear day. You can (almost) spend as much time at the top as you want before heading back down. It's possible to see wildlife on the way up and down."
405,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Rockford, IL ",Amazing views,The views are amazing and make it well worth the price to take the tram. We would list this as a must do activity when you are in the area.
406,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Family,PA ,Stunning - top of the world views,The tram takes you to the top of Mt.Rendezvous for some stunning views of the valley and surrounding mountains. The tram ride is very smooth and quick. Our tram was not crowded and it was easy to move around and get to see out a window on the way up and down. Travis was our tram operator; he was knowledgeable about the area and the tram. I am not a fan of heights but this was an easy ride and the views are so amazing that you kind of forget you are standing on the top of a mountain! Well worth the admission price. There is a small cafe/restaurant at the top but we did not partake of the food but it smelled really good.
407,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Miami, FL ",Fantastic Winter Wonderland!!!,"There was no snow in the valley, but you go up to 10,450 and that all changes. There was a ton of snow on the very top and it made me want to go skiing! Stunning views of the mountain range close and far. At a distance, you can see Teton Village and farther out, I presume Jackson. It was truly an amazing experience going up the team and walking up to the peak. A definite must do!!!"
408,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Swedesboro, NJ ",Amazing,Views are unparalleled. it takes you on top of rendezvous peak @ 10450 ft.  the tram is and feels very safe. they are also nice and clean.

410,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Cambridge, UK, ",Tram takes you to the summit of Mount Rendezvous quickly and safely,The view from the top over the Tetons and the Snake River Valley is truly stunning. Teton was experiencing its first snow of the season when we visited and it was 46 F in the village but 30F (below freezing!) at the top so dress appropriately.
411,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Issaquah, WA ",Not to be missed,"I would not miss this for any reason, well worth the cost, though we were not there to ski the view from the top is majestic, staff is fairly friendly, there is a small cafe at the top (the day we were there it was about 35 and the wind was blowing at 40 miles an hour with snow at the top) we went to warm up, had a hot adult beverage (which was delicious) and took the chill off. Not to be missed!"

I did that last year and it was a blast. This year I decided to take the tram to to top of mountain (not free!!) and hike down. I loved this version too. On the tram you get a great view of the ski resort and may even see some wild life. You can hang out on top, do some hiking or get some waffles at the Courbet's Cabin!"
413,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Pahrump, NV, ",A must do,The tram is an absolute must do trip. It is a 12 minute ride to the top and there you are provided with fabulous views in all directions on a clear day. The area at the top is broad and some hiking opportunities are available for a short hike or to take off on a backpacking trip. Be sure to get some waffles at the nearby Cabin......drinks are also available for purchase. Definitely worth the trip up!

415,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Indianapolis, IN ",Provides the BIG Picture!,"The Tram provides views of the entire Jackson Hole area and you can see for miles on a clear day. While afraid of heights, the tram, given its size and smooth ride, allows one to manage any fear easily and the view from the top is worth it! The area atop is broad and you can move about to your comfort level. Definitely a must do."
416,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,Illinois ,It's a Must See,"The tram lets you see the full surrounding area without doing a hike, now that's awesome. It's got a little place at the top to get a waffle and/or something to drink. If you're up to a few extra stairs the views at the very top are spectacular so don't forget your camera!"
417,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Belmont, MI ",Visit to Jackson Hole and the Grand Tetons,"Jackson Hole is a great place to visit! A trip to nearby Grand Teton National Park results in beautiful mountain scenery as far as the eye can see. There is plenty to do including shopping in downtown Jackson Hole and visiting the beautiful Jenny Lake at the foot of Grand Teton. At Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, one can ride the aereal tram and ski lifts to the top of the mountain for beautiful views of the mountainous countryside. Hang gliding is a popular activity from the top of the mountain and mountain biking and hiking trails are favorite activities in this area."
418,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Mathews, VA ",Fantastic way to see the area,"This was a fun and comfortable tram ride. Once you arrive, there are hiking trails and lots of photo opportunities. There is even a little snack bar with picnic tables. We walked around and enjoyed a beer after. This is a must-do."
419,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Jefferson City, MO ",Beautiful,Not much to do up there but you have to do it! The ride up and back is smooth and relaxing. Once at the top the views are spectacular even on a not so good weathher day. Make surw you dont miss it
420,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Irmo, SC ",A must do in Jackson!,"Taking the Tram to the top of the mountain in Teton Village was a great experience! We didn't do this on our last visit due to lack of time and so glad we did on this visit. Lots of area to walk around when you get to the top, beautiful views. The tram is very smooth, just a few little bumps and offers gorgeous views going up and down. The tram holds up to 100 people, limited sit down seating but hand grips hanging from ceiling and poles to hold on during the ride. You can get discounted tickets online and some Jackson brochures have a $5 off coupon. Highly recommend!"
421,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Elmhurst, IL ",Amazing View,"The tram tickets are a bit e pensive if you are not skiing. We were able to buy them on line and save $8 per ticket. The view is amazing. Unfortunately when we went up someone had cut an electric cord so there was no available food or drink. Plan to stay on top and do some of the hikes. Bring a jacket, it's cold up there."
422,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Dallas, TX ",Waffles good - watching the parasailing good.,Yes we paid $7.75 for a waffle with Nutella - you just shut your eyes and pay the exorbitant price to try something different and it was really delicious! Glad we did. We were able to watch the parasailing take off from the top of Rendezvous with their very brave clients in tow - that was a treat. The views were okay - somewhat limited due to the smoke from the Montana fires. I wouldn't go up the tram again. Once was enough. The gondola was shut down for the season unfortunately - we'll try that next time.
423,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017,not available,"canton, MI ",Overrated and overpriced!! Don't waste your $$,"Better views from summits inside the park. We were expecting awesome views of the Teton from atop Rendevous mountain but was sadly disappointed!! Had an okay view of the valley but nothing special compared to views from inside the park itself.    Didn't think it was worth the price they charged. Although the tickets are unlimited, the last tram is at 5:30 so unless you purchase tickets early in the am and do 2 trips, then definitely not worth it. Also there's really no need to go up more than once. There is really nothing up there except for a small store or a place that sells souvenirs and random waffles or something. Nothing special from the outside so didn't even bother going in."
424,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Lovely view but probably better when not so smoky,"Loved the views, both in transit and upon arrival at the top. Bring a hat and be prepared for sustained winds! We hiked around a bit and enjoyed what we could see thru the smoke. Coupons are available in newspaper and in literature rack near bathrooms so get one and dont pay full price cuz it is a little overpriced imo."
425,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Warwick, RI ",Loved it!,"We loved everything about the tram ride. It was smooth, fun, adventurous, the employees were personable, the music was upbeat, and of course the VIEWS!!!"
426,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Annapolis, MD ",Quick trip to view the scenery before for a float trip.,Great trip ; fantastic waffles at the top . Views are spectacular . The tram is comfortable and we were the first trip of the day so we had the seats in front .
427,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017,not available,"Fort Washington, PA ",One Time Adventure,"We visited Jackson Hole Village in the summer. We are not skiers and I do not like these types of ""lifts,"" but we thought it would be a great view from the top of the mountain. My oldest daughter is not only claustrophobic, but also afraid of heights, so she was really not thrilled about this adventure. The ride was smooth and only takes 12 minutes to get to the top. They did have to stop the Tram for a few minutes because of ""vibrations"" on the line. Five minutes felt like 2 hours, but the guide was very reassuring. The wind was blowing through the small open windows, so the sound was not helping my anxiety.    The view from the top was very nice, but we took the next tram down. The trip down was much easier with no stopping along the way. It was very nice, but once was enough."
428,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Orlando, FL ",Views are with the ride,Although it was hazy because of wildfires in Montana it was still worth the ride. Wish I could still ski I would like to take on the slopes in the winter.
429,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Friends,"Teton Village, WY ",Awesome!!!,"Fun in all seasons for entire family. Phenomenal views, smooth ride, effortless altitude gain, and sometimes wildlife (moose, bear, fox, etc.) sightings. Over 10,000' at top! Ride up in off-season and either hike or ride down to base. Heavy use in winter ski/boarding season with its access to entire mountain plus adjacent back-country. Also fun to watch hang gliders take off of Rendezvous Peak."
430,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Great vista from the top,"Climbing to over 10,000 feet you may see wildlife on way and enjoy spectacular views of the Tetons ."
431,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Millersville, MD ",A MUST DO attraction,"Tram up to 10,000' is a MUST  buy your tickets on line before you go -saves some money honeys! take your confirmation number to the window & ride the tram to the top. Must try the waffles....high altitude makes them fluffy! Also if you buy the pass for the day - on line - you can ride all the trams.  Views are sooooo worth it! The gondala was free after 5 pm & happy hour at the top is also worth it. Big Sky Country!"
432,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Birmingham, AL ",Teton Village Gondola Ride - Well worth the trip!,The Gondola in Teton Village will take you to a lovely restaurant on top of the world - with indoor and outdoor seating. It's free to ride after 5:00 p.m. It was our favorite happy hour place!
433,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Scottsdale, AZ ",Great view and great way to hike the Tetons!,"If you really want a unique way to view the Tetons the Tram is the way to go! $5 off coupons can be found all over! Your fee is good for all day so do a hike for the day, take the tram down and then go back up for sunset cocktail"
434,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2017,not available,"Brookeland, TX ",Great view!,"Neat experience! We met hikers that were traveling up with us, not to return for a week, as well as watching a guy parasail from the top."
435,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Family,"Aberdeen, UK ",Take good footwear,"We took the big tram up to the top, had a waffle snack at the small restaurant, then hiked down to the smaller gondolas to get back down to the bottom. The hike was about a couple of miles and not advisable for young children or less able bodied. It's quite rough terrain with scree slopes and a potential to fall. I would recommend it but make sure you have adequate footwear for the walk. Views were spectacular and we saw marmots, eagles and chipmunks on the way. There's a Café at the smaller gondolas for cold refreshments. Good exercise and worth spending a few hours of our holiday there."
436,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Family,"Leicester, UK ",Wonderful views,"Fairly expensive, but still worth the trip. Incredible views from the top and a very smooth ride. Make sure to do it on a clear day for the best views."
437,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Newport, OR ","Off season, no line, worth the time on a sunny day...","Sept, is usually considered ""shoulder season"" for travel. This is true for Jackson Hole area as well. No line to wait in, Very scenic IF it is a clear, sunny day (little to no clouds). We enjoyed the areal view at the top of the tram which provided ample photo opportunities. Be sure you find out what the tempurature is at the top of the tram and dress and/or bring clothes that will make your time enjoyable."
438,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Jacksonville Beach, FL ","Tram up, Gondola down","The best hiking option is to take the tram up, hike DOWN the Cirque Trail, and take the gondola down. It is a tough, steep, and uneven hike even when walking down. I felt VERY SORRY for those attempting to hike the other direction, uphill."
439,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"New Orleans, LA ","A must, expensive but worth it!","No trip to Teton Village is complete without taking the Tram. It is an amazing engineering feet. And, the views are without compare."
440,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Washington DC, DC ",Great view - go after 5:00 PM in Summer,"There are two tram type lifts, the one going to a lower level ends up at a very nice restaurant with great views. We took that - it was free after 5:00 PM at least in the Summer. The view is exceptional. I took the other one years ago, and it has an even better view, but is never free. These are very expensive for Summer entertainment unless you take the free one after 5:00 PM. I assume the rates are much higher during ski season."
441,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Family,"New York City, NY ",Excellent day hiking,"We spent the day here with our 16 and 20 year old daughters. We caught the aerial tram up and hiked around the summit. It was a cold overcast day up on the top and we were glad we had worn layers. As we hiked and the sun came through, it got quite warm. The views were spectacular and we just wish we had booked to do the paragliding too"
442,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Kettering, UK ",Well executed,"The tram team were very well organised for the Eclipse, staff were very friendly and embraced the eclipse atmosphere."
443,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Vienna, VA ",Fun mountain top hike,"Took the tram to the top of Jackson Hole resort and, as you'd expect, the views are breathtaking. I have skied in the Colorado Rockies for 30 years and didnt think I could be impressed by mountains but I was wrong. I realize now why the Grand Tetons are singled out as far as ""must see"" sites are concerned.    We then did a nice 5 mile mountain top hike from Rendezvous peak to the peak the Gondola serves. It was a tough one for city folk like us but well rewarded with a few beers and snacks at the Gondola looking out over the valley. Simply beautiful."
444,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Family,"Nashville, TN ",Expensive,"The tram is a great way to get to the top of the mountain, but it's super expensive for what it is: I bought a day pass because I was going to ride the gondola up to near the top, then hike The Cirque trail and hop the team down. It was $42 for one adult. Too much!"
445,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017,not available,"Greater London, UK ",Amazing views,"We took the tram the day before the 2017 solar eclipse and so the whole area was super busy, but we arrived fairly early and beat most of the queues.  The team is a fabulous example of well thought out engineering and the ride up is breathtaking and on arriving at the top, the views are outstanding! But... we're in our 50's, probably not the fittest individuals and actually felt a bit unwell at the top and think it may have been the altitude...  So still worth the amazing views, but we literally had a quick walk round, cup of coffee at the really friendly coffee shop / cafe and then came back down... its much more designed for the serious trekker (summer) / expert skier (winter)."
446,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Nashville, TN ",View at the top.,great ride up the mountain. Had time for hot chocolate and cookie. wonderful view from the top. very glad we took the time to enjoy this attraction.
447,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Solo, ,Breathtaking view,"First time I experienced sth like this... Riley was our guide, it takes around 15 mins to get you to the top. Theres famous corbets cabin where you can get waffles"
448,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Phoenix, AZ ",Incredible experience,"A fifteen minute ride in a spacious gondola with panoramic views of the Teton Village and Jackson Hole, followed by an unreal view of the Grand Teton and Teton Range. Dress warmly even during the summer, you're going to be at over 10,000 feet."
449,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Couples,"Blackstone, MA ",The views are amazing,"My wife and I went up on this tram on May 20th. We did a float tour in the morning, then had a great lunch in Jackson Hole, then went up on this tram. The tram runs like every 12-15 minutes and holds up to 100 people, so (depending on when you are there), there is not a long wait. When we boarded the tram, it was 55 degrees, 12 minutes later when we got to the top, it was 20 degrees and there was a wicked wind chill possibly bringing the temperature into the negatives. The tram waits for 2-3 minutes before descending and where I only had a sweatshirt on, my wife and I ran around the platform, took a bunch of pictures, then got back on the tram for the return ride down. It was pretty overcast the day we were there, but it didn't take away from the beauty of the surrounding area."
450,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Miami, FL ",A view you can't miss,"Ride to the top of the world! Many trails to chose from: the cirque trail takes you to the lower gondolas ( at Piste) with an array of landscape, flowers, wildlife and peak views!"
451,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Hugo, OK ",Beautiful views,"My husband and I rode the tram to the top one afternoon. There was a short wait at the bottom while waiting for the tram to return from the top. It was a large tram with huge windows, there were a few seats to sit on. The views were nice on the way up, but the view at the summit was fabulous! A definite go do when in Jackson Hole."
452,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Business,"Oklahoma City, OK ",Beautiful ride to the top of the ski area!,"We took the tram later in the day, about 4:30, and there was no line. Great views of the mountain as well as the valley... small place to eat at the top. Instead of taking the tram down, we hiked the two mile Cirque trail to the top of the gondola and it was incredible, not challenging at all, but you should have good shoes on. Had drinks and appetizers at the restaurant at the top of the gondola and took the ride back down. The gondola is free after six and runs until about 9 PM as it services the restaurant."
453,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Solo,"Lake Placid, NY ",Do this - go! Super cool! Amazing views at top.,"Just go, don't think twice. It's worth the price and you get amazing views at the top. Only advice is to check the weather before you go up to make sure it's not cloudy or rainy."
454,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Frankfort, IL ",Not for the Faint of Heart!,"If you are looking for a little adventure for a group of all ages, this the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram is a must. The views are spectacular and the summer is the best time to visit. Once you get to the top just and enjoy the 360 degree views and a little refreshment at the restaurant."
455,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Cuenca, Ecuador ",Amazing 360 degree views!,"A feeling of being on ""the top world""  Amazing views of the valley, the Tetons and mountain ranges with snow spots still in summer!    The best waffles with sugar butter are there and you just can't miss them!    A must do family adventure at Tetons Village!"
456,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Eagle Rock, MO ",Loved the views,Just a short wait and we were there in late afternoon. Our host was very knowledgeable and entertaining. The views were spectacular.
457,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Lenexa, KS ",Excellent Tram Ride,"If you want to feel as close to the top of the Tetons without actually hiking the Tetons, taking this tram is the way to do it. There were a few ambitious teens (from a hiking or track team) who had hiked all the way up (kudos to them); my husband and I were less ambitious and took the 12-15 minute tram up. It was a great view along the way and once we got there. After you get off the tram, you can hike a bit (it's really just going up some steps) to get to the summit of the mountain we were on (if I can do it, anyone can!).    Spectacular views. Also, after all that effort, reward yourself by going to the little cafe that specializes in waffles. You won't need syrup. Really. I mean it. We had the brown sugar ones (that had been split, with brown sugar butter spread in between and then put back together for a final toasting). You already feel from the height you are in heaven and once you have the waffles you will truly feel like you really are there.    Great views on the way down as well. So glad we didn't blow this off. Amazing view and ride."
458,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,Nebraska ,Definitely Worth the Price,"The tram is high priced but totally worth it. And once you get to the top, t here is a waffle restaurant and hiking trails. There is so much to see. If you are lucky, you might even get to see some wildlife on the way up."
459,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Family,"Houston, TX ",Fun way to travel to lunch!,"We were on a family ski trip, although 2 of us did not ski, but enjoyed the area and took care of the 18 month old. We took the Tram to lunch one day to enjoy the view and a nice lunch. Beautiful views!"
460,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Staunton, IL ",Great Family Adventure,Definitely worth purchasing these tickets online for the discount. Great lounge and restaurant at the top of the gondola tram. The aerial tram takes 12 minutes to get up and down and runs every 15 minutes. Views at the top were amazing.
461,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family, ,Must do!,"The Tram is fantastic! Smooth, scenic ride that takes you to the top of the world! Close enough, anyway. Views are amazing! Waffles and beer while overlooking the Tetons...Priceless Memories!"
462,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Phuket, Thailand ",Loved it,Pass on the waffle shop (gag) but there were terrific views accented by parasailors who jumped off the cliffs and soared into the sky ( in the morning.). The hiking was fantastic too. Bring oxygen.    We will do it again.
463,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2017 , Business, ,Grand Teton,"Close to National Parks,great customer service and lots of entertainments at the Teton Village for everyone!"
464,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Medford, NY ",Amazing Views of the Grand Tetons,"My husband and I took the Aerial Tram to the ""Top of the World"". The waffle house at the top was really good. Seeing snow, eating hot waffles, and taking in the views was awesome. We asked at the info desk how long the hike was from the tram to the chair lift , which would bring us back down to the mountain and we were told it was a 3 mile hike DOWNHILL. You walk along the ski trail and the views were absolutely breathtaking! Unfortunately, the hike was much longer and the first 3 miles were DOWNHILL, the last 1 mile was UPHILL to get to the chair lift. IT was HOT and trudging uphill for the LAST mile was rough. We laughed it off as we hiked uphill.  The views were great, the path was safe and wide. The beer when we reached the chair lift was well deserved and the deck / patio area at the chairlift was very comfortable as well."
465,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family, ,"""High""light of Our Trip","Our family took the tram up early in the morning, ate some scrumptious waffles, took in the scenery at the peak and spent the rest of the day hiking the mountaintop. It was an experience to remember and well worth the cost. This is a must do when you visit Jackson Hole and we are excited to come back and experience it all over again!"
466,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Iowa City, IA ",One of our favorite things to do...,"This was an amazing experience for our whole family. The tram ride is smooth and provides amazing 360 degree views. Once you are at the top, you need to try the waffles, even if you get one and share...they are amazing. The hot chocolate was wonderful as well! Dress warm for the trip up, it was very chilly the day we went (40 degrees). When you are ready to leave, you can choose to take a trail to the gondola stop down the mountain a ways or take the tram down. We then took the gondola ride up the mountain and saw lots of wildlife. It was a little rainy so we did not do the ski lift. While there, you can go on guided bike trails, hiking trails, and can even parasail. It is a great little spot with tons of activities. Book online, it is cheaper."
467,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Exeter, UK ",Great trip,We were unsure of doing this but it turned out to be an excellent adventure with amazing views. You can paraglide from the top and is sometimes cheaper if you arrange with the guys st the top rather than pre-arrange. The cafe at the top is run by a bunch of surly staff who clearly wish they were somewhere else but it's worth a cup of tea.
468,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Fort Worth, TX ",Amazing Views,"Had heard many times ""you have to do it."" So we did it, booked online saved 8 pp. it gives you unlimited rides same day on three different trams going to different heights. The view atop is amazing and breath taking or maybe it was the altitude! Even at 34.00 it was a cool thing to do."
469,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Ringgold, GA ",Amazing!,This is such a great way to go up the mountain and see the incredible views. They charge you a lot but you have unlimited trips the day you go. Be sure to buy your tickets on line because it is much cheaper.
470,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Mount Laurel, NJ ",Well worth the trip,Just amazing views! Buy on line and save $8. Wear warm gear for the top. Bring binoculars for the view. There are trails up there too. A must stop for your JH experience.
471,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Venlo, The Netherlands ","Beautiful views, great trails!","We visited Teton village today and enjoyed the tramway a lot. The views are great, especially towards the mountains. We walked the cirque trail from the endpoint of the tramway towards the gondola. This was mainly downhill and a beautiful trail, very much recommended!"
472,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017,not available,"Farmington, MO ",This is a MUST DO!!,"Wow. Guys. If you are unsure on whether to do the Tram - let me tell ya - do it !! We got there at 8:30 AM on a gorgeous, sunny July morning and bought our tickets . $85 for our family . Took the first tram up the mountain. Views are beyond spectacular - ride is smooth and our tram operator chatted with us all the way up. We even had a paraglider that we got to watch take off from the top !! We took the short hike at the top, stopped in the store to look around and headed back down. All together we spent about an hour in top. The ride down was amazing as well. Also - your wrist band allows you to ride the chairlift (10 min or so roundtrip) and the gondola ride - do these also - they are all right there together in Teton Village !"
473,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,Missouri ,WOW! Don't miss it!,"This was definitely our highlight in the Jackson Hole area. I'm NOT a fan of heights, but I'm so glad that, with my wife's encouragement, we took the ride. The views of the valley and the mountains really are spectacular. The ride itself wasn't bad at all either. Our tram operator was very good at giving folks a heads up when we went over the towers causing the carriage to sway a bit - nothing too bad. It took me a bit to get used to the movement of the carriage but after that it was OK. The views from the top are amazing also. We had several people that went up with us that did tandem parasailing back down. It was fun to watch them take off. And yes, the hot chocolate and waffles at the top are good. A cup of hot chocolate and a waffle will set you back about $10 - for my wife and I easy to share both. It is a bit chilly up on the top. However, we were on a relatively calm and warm day at the end of July. It was about 60 degrees (F) at the top. We stayed about an hour at the top. If you have trouble walking, there are easy walking paths that avoid lots of stairs that will take you to some great viewing spots."
474,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017,not available,"Mount Pleasant, SC ",Love aerial trams,The view of the resort valley was beautiful as was the view from the top of the tram. Food was available in the building at the top and a place to sit in the sun. The trails were not clear of snow but you could walk down some of them for a way. Alpine wild flowers were out. A pleasant afternoon jaunt.
475,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017,not available,"D'Iberville, MS ",YOU CAN SEE FOREVER,What a great ride. It was a little crowded but we still enjoyed it. When we arrived at the top you could see forever. It was a clear and beautiful day. I bought my tickets in advanced so we did not have to stand in line. I would recommend it to everyone.
476,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Fun but on the pricey side,"We had changed plans the day we ended up in the Teton Village due to weather and water conditions (too rough for rafting), so we booked the aerial tram. It ended up closing due to high winds right after we purchased our passes, so we switched gears again for the day, but knew we wanted to come back for the tram the next day. The staff at the ticket window were very accommodating, they just changed the dates on our wristbands and we were done! When we came back the next day, it was so worth it! We took the tram up first thing in the morning, what amazing views! We ate breakfast at the top of Rendezvous, and some clouds rolled in at the top. No worries again, we took the tram back down and it was sunny and 70 in the valley! Using the same wristbands, we took the gondolas as well, which don't go as high up as the tram, but are just as fun because they're smaller and you can open the windows for some great photos. By the time we hung out at the top of the gondolas and came back down, the clouds at the top of Rendezvous had cleared, so using the same wristbands, we took the aerial tram back up. My 10 year old daughter got the greatest kick out of both of these experiences, if you have a day and can spare the funds, its a heck of a lot of fun! From an engineering perspective, the tram is an amazing feat!"
477,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Dubuque, IA ",Awesome!!,"I read reviews and wondered if it really was going to be worth the price ($250 for 11). They had a family package that makes it a bit cheaper, we did this. The ride up and down is 12 minutes each way of beautiful views. We spotted a moose on the way up! We got waffles at the top, pricy but we're good. Our kids enjoyed watching the gliders jump from the side of the mountain. Many hiking trails to enjoy. Include it in the tickets is gondola and ski lift rides!"
478,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Naples, FL ",Breathtaking views!,"This is a must do when visiting Teton Village in the summer! The tram glides peacefully along, and the views are spectacular from any vantage point. When we exited at the top, I was taken aback at how far we had gone. We were able to take great photos from many areas on the mountain top, and there is even a higher area which one can climb (via steps) to see the full 360 view. There was still snow on this mountain top when we arrived, which made it quite special. The tram drivers are quite nice and areas of interest, such as the scary triple black diamond run, are pointed out. We even saw some animals on the slopes. So glad we had this adventure!"
479,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,The Netherlands ,"I love mountains, and these views are INCREDIBLE!","I don't know what it is about mountains that make me love them so much. I just feel better when I'm in mountains... is it the altitude, fresh air, views, or what? I have no idea. Don't get me wrong, I love beaches and forests too, but there's just something magic about mountains, no matter what continent I'm on. Going up this tram was the very first thing we did once we got to the Jackson Hole area. Even though the weather changed and clouds rolled in while we were up there, we were exhilarated and stayed as long as we could. There was beauty every single direction you faced. We had a snowball fight, built a rock cairn, walked to the very edges to look down, and ate waffles in the little restaurant. (I think the ones we had were lemon. The kids didn't like them, but I thought they were fantastic!) Even the ride up and down is interesting. We saw a mother and baby moose, a number of hikers, and some amazing ski runs... ask the tram operator about the one named after Mr. Sands. You won't believe anyone would be crazy enough to ski that part of the mountain! It was really just gorgeous and gave me a sense of wonder that I only feel in the highest places. I honestly would go back every day if I could."
480,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Goodyear, AZ ",Spectacular Views,"We took the lift up the side of a mountain to an elevation of over 10,000 feet. There was still snow on the ground in July. The views of Jackson and the Snake River were awesome. It takes about 15 minutes to go to the top and another 15 back down. Once at the top you can stay and take as many pictures as you want. You can then take any tram back down. Be sure to take a jacket as it is always about 20 degrees cooler at the top than the bottom. The cost was well worth it. We saw much wildlife on the way up and down. Sadly, though, no bears. The guide told us he usually sees bears, elk, deer, and sheep all the time."
481,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Fargo, ND ","My kids (7,9,12,14) say it's much better than hiking!","10 minutes and you're having a snowball fight! It's terrific. We made the mistake of taking a kid with a bad cold on this and his ears hurt so bad that we ended up in the walk-in later that day. This is a very commercialized area with everything costing money to do. However this tramway was well-worth the price. It also included two other lifts up the mountain. We could not find a place to find a picnic, as there are many restaurants and stores and such at Canyon Village and it's not really set-up for that. But Grand Teton national park is close by."
482,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017,not available,"Louisville, KY ",Fabulous views!,The views from the top were stunning. Wish we had had more time to do some hiking. Worth the ride up! Kids loved it too.
483,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Tampa, FL ","Long ride to the top, so worth it!","Taking this tram ride all the way to 10400 ft was slightly intimidating for me being deathly afraid of heights, however, it was great! the ride was very smooth and they play a recording all the way that makes it feel like you are at Universal Studios the whole way. the view is amazing and once at the top, the metal platform is a little scary, but it's fine. there are even ski poles available to walk with if you like. The trails at the top of the mountain are a must. and it's quite a bit cooler up there so take a jacket. the snack shop at the top is great and the wafflles they serve are piping hot with brown sugar or nutella or strawberry topping...yum! we are so glad we went"
484,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Carmel, CA ",Really nice way to see the area,Was the first thing we did when we arrived at Teton Mountain area... very comfortable ride to top of mountain where you can see forever.
485,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Dunedin, FL ",Quite a view,"Not advertised, but ask if there is a military discount. If you are eligible the savings is great. A good ride and view. With luck you may spot moose and bear. View from the top is terrific."
486,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Charlotte, NC ",Great ride but extremely expensive,"This was a very nice experience for our family but also very expensive. The views are amazing. The ride itself is nice and doesn't take long. However, the only con I had was the price. Way too much and won't do it again."
487,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Tallahassee, FL ",Wildflower hikes & riding the tram,"We had the best day riding the Tram, hiking down to the gondola through fields of wildflowers. Then riding the gondola down, back up on the chair lift followed by more hiking down to the mountain base. The views from the top are spectacular and the kids loved seeing snow in July. I think this may have been the favorite hike for the kids. Also- the waffle shack at the top of the tram is totally worth it. The waffles make for great street food as they are filled, folded over, cut into 4 wedges, and wrapped in foil."
488,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Friends,South Dakota ,Amazing views,"Absolutely stunning views, great way to see the mountains up close for us non hikers! On the ride up we were fortunate enough to see a bull moose. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable and kept us entertained.We didn't try the waffles at the top but heard others talking about how great they were."
489,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Pearland, TX ",Don't miss this !,This is really the highlight of our visit to Jackson Hole. We purchased a family pass in town for $87 and it included 3 different trams/ lifts to the top of the mountain. Go try the waffles at the top of Rendezvous Mountain after you get off the tram. Fantastic! The chair lift was fun as well as the gondola. You could easily spend a day here. Plenty of activities for the kids too. Really fun !
490,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples, ,Tram,"I don't like heights. This was awesome,did not bother me at all. View was beautiful. Waffles we're not as good as I heard, but worth getting. If you are here, try it"
491,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Washington DC, DC ",Quick visit to Rendezvous Mountain,"We took the tram up to the top of Rendezvous Mountain one afternoon just as a storm was rolling in. The staff was fantastic at informing us of the options of boarding the tram to come back down, or watching the storm from Corbet's Cabin. After it started snowing at the high elevation we chose to come back down before the rest of the storm rolled in. It's a fantastic view from The Top of the World up there and we highly recommend it to everyone to take the tram up and explore the area!!"
492,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Buford, GA ",Excellent time,The tram was an excellent way to see the scenic side of Jackson Hole. It only took 15 minutes to get to the top and the views were amazing the time. I would suggest going early in the morning because the lines to get longer throughout the day!
493,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Olive Branch, MS ",Tram and aerial view,Our kids loved the tram ride and enjoyed having a view of the Grand Tetons up close... They took lots of pictures and enjoyed Hot Chovolate and snow in the middle of July.... AMAZING
494,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Wichita Falls, TX ",Awesome,Took the Aerial Tram to the top and it was awesome! Definitely a must do if you find yourself in Jackson Hole.
495,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Orland Park, IL ",Fun and fab views!,"We took the tram to the top on a warm July day and just wow, it was gorgeous. My hubby and kids loved eating waffles at the restaurant up top too!"
496,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family, ,So fun!,"I'm glad we bit the bullet and paid to do this. The views are unbelievable. I mean, you are on top of the mountain!!! It was quite windy, could have used a jacket. We felt like the price was somewhat high but we were glad we decided to buy the tickets and ride up."
497,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,Nebraska ,"Loved the Tram, Waffles Not So Much","We visited Jackson Hole in June and took the tram to the top about 9:30 am. Take layers. It was about 45 degrees at the top. Beautiful views! We thought it was a bit pricey until we realized it was good for some of the other lifts at the resort and was good for all day. We planned to do some hiking on the mountain so that was perfect. On our hike down from the smaller gondola a hiker did say they saw a grizzly on the trail. We saw deer. Loved the tram and trails. But one traveler tip... and just our families opinion. The waffles at the top are not world famous by any means. Pretty much a medium sized, thin waffle sandwich with some jam or Nutella slapped on and wrapped in foil for $8. Enough for me to eat but not for my husband and teenage boys. Had we known this, we would NOT have planned to have our breakfast there and then go hiking for a few hours. If you eat there...take an extra snack or eat before hand. They do sell hot cocoa, bottled water, etc."
498,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,Italy ,So very fun!,It was BEAUTIFUL! The wind was blowing. I recommend layers. We hiked around and built a tiny little snowman.
499,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Bluffton, SC ",She didn't want to do it!!,"It is ridiculously expensive and mostly worth it. The views changed about 15 times while we were on the summit --- based entirely on the weather. I would love to do it again on a completely clear day (for the photos). Still, we experienced wind, sun, haze, rain, and lightning. Our departure was delayed over fears of a lightning strike. I am not crazy. It just made the whole thing more entertaining. My wife thought that it was a total waste of money and ending up loving the experience. If you can afford it just do it. By the way we interacted a lot with the staff and they were all great.    We spent more than two hours on the mountain because of the weather induced delays. That was great because our return tram was spacious. You could spend much more time (walking the many trails) or much less if you prefer a quick return. All good."
500,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Goochland, VA ",Awesome,"We loved this. It was not expensive, especially when compared to other Tram rides. I bought a family pack online and got a great discount (I think we saved $8/per person). Then we purchased one senior ticket for my mom. My mom is afraid of heights and still enjoyed it. On the ride up an informational CD is played which was nice. The top is awesome. We got waffles in the Top of the World restaurant, which I highly recommend just for the experience. It's $7.50 per waffle that is served in foil with no utensils. It's cool. It's all about the experience. My kids, who are 9 and 12 LOVED it."
501,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"West Hartford, CT ",fun for the whole family,"This was the biggest mountain resort the kids have been too, and it was awe-inspiring for them. It'll take your breath away."
502,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Jacksonville, FL ",Fantastic views,If you like mountain vistas with spectacular views of Jackson Hole you will love this tram. The ride is smooth with a short narration but the views will take your breath away when you step off at the peak of the mountain. Make sure to bring your camera.
503,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",Such fun,"The tram ride is brief and a bit pricey, but totally different from other activities at Jackson Hole. The scenery is splendid and you get to stand in snow in June. Please, please do not come this high wearing shorts and t shirts, it is cold and windy at the top, like 32 degrees in June. At the bottom it was in the mid 70's."
504,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2017 , Family,"Houston, TX ","A little expensive, but worth it",We were able to do the family pass and bought it at one of the stores around the town square - saved the $8 and didn't have to deal with the online purchase via the phone.    The kids were really happy to play in the snow in late June. It was a perfectly clear day and we got some tremendous photos (made it worth the money).
505,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017,not available,"Lizton, IN ",Pricey but cool,Our family took the aerial tram and gondola ride with the family pass. You can save $8 by buying them online. We went when it opened at 9 am and had breakfast at the top of Mt Rendezvous. Pricey but super cool experience!
506,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017,not available,"McKinney, TX ",Great way to spend an afternoon,Our group of 9 ranging in age from 7 to 70 all enjoyed this. Pricy but worth it. We didn't stay long at the top. It's pretty windy and cold so take a jacket.
507,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Friends,"San Jose, California, United States ",Beautiful View,"Rode ""Big Red"" to the summit of Rendezvous Mountain. The ride was smooth as we climb to 10,000+ elevation. The View at the top was spectacular and there's a small show at the summit with souvenirs and hot chocolate. The temperature dropped at least 20 degrees so be sure to wear layers. Once you arrive at the top, there's a short walk up some stairs to the actual summit. The tram runs every 15 minutes. This is really a ski area so at the base there are shops."
508,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",Quick ride to the top for summer hiking,This is a quick way to get some elevation before hiking in the Tetons. Also great on the knees instead of hiking down. So beautiful.
509,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Annapolis, MD ",What a blast for the whole family!,We had heard this was the fastest Aerial Tram in the USA and we wanted to try it. Went 2.5 miles up the mountain in 11 minutes to the top. It was 68 degrees when we started at the base and 34 degrees with snow at the summit. Great views! Restaurant open at the top. Our tickets also allowed us to ride the other two gondolas. This ride is a must to not only see the beautiful views but to marvel at the engineering behind the serial tram.
510,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Tampa, FL, ",Beautiful Smooth Ride to Top! Hint...Buy Tickets On-Line to Save Money,"We had the perfect day to ride the Aerial Tram to the Mountain Top. Tram runs every 15 minutes. Opens at 9:00 am. You will save $8.00 pp if you buy on;line at their website or $5.00 if you cut out a coupon from the daily Jackson Hole newspaper. We went up to top in Mid-June. 74 degrees in the valley below, 50 degrees on top. Still snow on the mountain tops, but a path was cleared to get to the absolute peak and some of the trails were opened in the area. Views are god-like spectacular. The tickets are good for one-full day. You can go up to the summit as many times as you would like, but have to wait in line again to do so. You can also take the gondola to the Rendezvous Lodge with the same ticket. Just do it if your in the Jackson Hole Area."
511,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Houston, TX ",Tram is a smooth ride and the view is awesome!,"The tram is very smooth and runs every 15 minutes and is on time! The view is awesome. Unfortunately, the mountain tops still had 15 feet plus of snow therefore the trails were not easily accessible...however they left it to our discretion. I wish they had told us that before we went up because we had planned on hiking all over the top but due to the trails not being visible to decided against trying it. The day we were on top there was not a cloud in the sky so it was beautiful to hang out up there for awhile. If you can't hike around it is a pricey trip but I would do it again when there isn't so much snow."
512,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Ashburnham, MA ",Beautiful Ride,Great ride up to the top of rendezvous mountain. The views are incredible. Runs like clockwork every 15 minutes. Buy your tickets online - saves $.
513,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Kansas City, MO ",Terrific ride and views,"We balked at first because of the price until we found out that it was for both the Tram, gondolas and the chairlift. We first rode the Tram to the top of Rendezvous mountain. The ride was very nice but the views at the top were spectacular. We had waffles and some hot chocolate with a touch of Jameson. We then rode the gondola up to the Deck@Piste. More great views and a wide choice of dining. The gondolas are free after 5 PM for the mountain dining.    We did not ride the chairlift."
514,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Lacey, WA ",Fast Ride To The Top,"Good way to take photo of the valley from 10,000 feet. Nice quick ride in large gondola car to the top. Very small restrurant at top but lots to see. Bring a coat as the temp is 30 degrees or so lower than the valley when we went. When you buy a ticket it is a all day one that is also good for the chair lift and smaller gondola at the Village."
515,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Illinois, ",Rare adventure,"The Aerial Tram ride is a rare adventure. It takes about 10 min one way. Buy tickets online - you'll save money.    The top is Rendezvous mountain at roughly 10,400'. From the top, you get a phenomenal view of the entire Jackson Hole area and surrounding mountains. There's signage telling you what's where.    We went in early June and there were no crowds/lines - but I understand during ski season or later in the summer it gets really busy with long lines. Up on top there are some trails to hike - everything angles down hill (because you are at the peak) - so be prepared to hike back up afterwards.    The last tram up is at 4:45; last one down is at 5:15. Glad I checked in advance, we took the 4:00 up - and returned on the 5:00.    There is a small cafe and store at the top. They are known for their waffles. There are interpretive boards out front."
516,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Fort Collins, Colorado, United States ",Vacation,"Fun, great views, lots of wild flowers. Trails closed at top because they are still snow packed, so don't go expecting to hike down, like we did. The time was still fun. It's nice to have a hot waffle and coffee at 10,000 feet. Best tip: You get a discount when you purchase tickets on-line from their website."
517,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,United States ,Aerial Tram a must do!,"We signed up for this prior to our trip and it exceeded expectations. Had no idea it went up 4,100 vertical feet. Great scenic views, smooth ride. Temperature difference of about 25 degrees. Still quite a bit of snow this year. Waffles were a fun top of the mountain activity and the hot chocolate was a hit. Handicap accessible as well. Plenty of activities to do at the base including ropes course, drop tower, bungee trampoline, biking and rock climbing. Beware that the wind and rain/snow can interfere so best to call ahead. Good family ticket deals online."
518,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Forney, TX ","Amazing! But...shorts at the bottom; coat, scarf, and gloves at the top.","We rode up and down on this thing twice, since rides are unlimited once you pay for the pass. Less than 100 dollars for three of us, and I felt that was more than fair. The first time, we got out and walked to Corbin's Cabin to spend some time at the top (15 minutes between cars). It was FREEZING at the top, but luckily we had brought all our heavy gear for the top. It rained, sleeted, and snowed while we were up there. Although we went into the cabin (where the smell of waffles was taunting us), we did not enjoy the waffles or a hot drink. As you can imagine, the tables were full and people were waiting. It has bathrooms, and was a neat place, though. The views are amazing from up that high! I felt a little unsafe in the winds, so I did not get close enough to the side to get the really excellent views. My SO and my daughter were very pleased with it, however. The second time, we just rode and stayed on. It was snowing furiously and everything was white when we went back up. We'll definitely go back next time we visit."
519,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Fairless Hills, PA ",I can't believe the view,"First, I am afraid of heights - that being said, don't let that stop you from doing this. The view is magnificent. It was a clear day today and it seemed like we could see forever. The true majesty of the area is on full display when you simply stand at the top and look around. Of course, I did treat myself to a waffle with brown sugar - a reward for actually going up there. The tram is a surprisingly smooth ride - and even when there was an unexpected stop midway on the way down today, there was nothing jerky in the movements. So just do it.. you will be glad you did..."
520,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Midlothian, VA ",Must take Tram...,"WOW, WOW, WOW... unbelievable views! This is a must. You won't be disappointed when you reach the top. Small hut at top a great place to relax before going back down."
521,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Toledo, OH ",Surprisingly delightful,We had an awesome time here. A bit expensive but you can use it as many times as you want. Amazing views from the top and a nice little hike on the mountaintop even though a lot was still closed in late spring. fantastic waffles. Guides were very good. Good spotting of wildlife in the tram.
522,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Fun ride to the top for a waffle lunch,"Its not the cheapest activity, but our family took the tram up to the top of the mountain to check out the views and have some waffles at Corbin's Cabin for lunch. The tram is very well run and a smooth ride (even in the wind), and the waffles at the top are a fun treat. (We liked the strawberry the best). Just be prepared for cold -- it was 37 degrees at the top -- so bring a coat."
523,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017,not available,"Arlington, Texas ",FABULOUS experience!,"I have a fear of heights, but felt very secure in the tram. This adventure was a highlight of our vacation. The tram operator does a great job explaining what you are seeing and the history of the area during the ride. The views are phenomenal. This is a new tram built in 2008 to replace the old one.    We had fun doing photos in the snow on the top with our daughter jumping up in the air. Be sure and use this as a photo opportunity. Other visitors are good about taking pictures for you. Makes lovely memories. Feels like you're on top of the world. Views are amazing in all directions.    Ticket prices seemed pricey, but it was worth every penny and we were so glad we did this ride. Be sure and go in Corbet's Cabin while at the top and get a brown sugar butter topped waffle. They were the best, light and airy waffle I've ever had and I don't generally even prefer waffles.    Be sure and wear shoes rather than sandals and bring a jacket so you can enjoy walking around. It was quite chilly and windy on top of Rendezvous Mountain."
524,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Boston, MA ",Next to Last Tram to the Top,"We took the 4:30 tram and the last one down is 5:30. 67 at the base and 41 at the summit. But very windy, so I'm guessing the wind chill was in the teens.    There is a cabin/snack shop at the top where you can get out of the wind.    But you go for the views which are spectacular. You can see into Idaho, and down into the Teton Valley including Wilson, Jackson Hole, the airport and Grand Teton National Park.    It is a bit pricey, $42 pp.    And don't miss the last tram...it's a long hike down."
525,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017,not available, ,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!,"Perfect day! We rode the comfortable Tram up the mountain. It was sunny and 65 degrees. Amazing views and we got some pretty great pictures. Spectacular scenery. The personnel working for the Tram were outstanding too. Just before we left, some paragliders came up, set up their gear and ran straight off the mountain. So cool!!!"
526,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ","Great View, but Expensive. You can SKIP this and go directly to Grand Teton..........","We visited Jackson WY on June 4 and decided to take the aerial tram based on the reviews and recommendations from TripAdvisor. We purchased tickets online in advance, so we paid 30 bucks per person instead of 37 at the door (it's before June 10, so it's the early season price). However, only the Aerial tram was operating. Neither the lifts nor the gondola were working at the time we visited.    The Aerial Tram ride is pretty cool. It takes about 12 min one way to the top and back. The operator/staff in the tram is friendly and will answer any questions from you during the ride, and the view from the ride is phenomenal. However, given the fact that we were there earlier in the season, there were not much activities going on both in the village and on the mountain top. We basically took the tram up to the top, walked around, enjoyed the view, took some pictures, and took the tram down. And again, because the lifts and gondola were not operating at the time we visited, that's pretty much what we could do while visiting Teton village. With 30 bucks for a round trip and a view, it's EXPENSIVE.    To be honest, there are so many things you can do in Jackson and Grand Teton National Park. There are plenty of trails you can hike, many beautiful lakes you can swim or paddle, and lots of wildlife and natural beauty you can enjoy more than just taking the tram. Did we enjoy our view on the tram ride? Yes! But is it worth to spend 30 bucks (now would be 34 to 42 bucks) to just enjoy the view on the ride? Definitely NOT! Had we known that it's just a tram ride, we could have saved the money and did more hiking in the Teton's. We might not reach the mountain top by hiking, but we are guaranteed to have some beautiful views on our way.    So what's my take? If you just want to do touristic things, go for it. But if you are young, energetic, and enjoying exercise, skip Teton Village and dive directly into the beautiful Grand Teton National Park and enjoy - the Aerial Tram ride should not be on your top priority on your visit."
527,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Friends, ,Logo On Window Blocks View,"The tram was crowded, I get that, but the bummer was a large part of the window had a Jackson logo - which BLOCKED good viewing potential. Yes, it was a ""screened"" logo, but it annoyed me. Remove the logo so we can see. The Tram operators knowledgeable, playing their tunes for entertainment."

531,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples, ,Spectacular Views,"My wife and I recently took the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram for a summer day excursion. It was a great experience. We traveled it during the morning hours. Tickets were purchased and good all day for the JH Tram, the Gondola and another lift. My wife needs assistance in walking and was able to use an elevator to access the Tram. The staff was friendly and very helpful with our needs. The ride up was smooth with no issues. The views were amazing! Once to the top, the weather was very windy and cool. Be sure to bring warm jackets, gloves, and hat! We explored around the summit, taking advantage of the donor walking poles! Snow was still on the ground there. We did need to warm up in he summit store. My wife did have some access issues to the store as there no step access to the store. That was the only negative of the whole experience. Restrooms were useful but not lavish, as you would expect at this high altitude. The views of the surrounding mountains and valleys below was special. What a treat, well worth the ticket cost. The ride down was again very smooth and event free! We highly recommend it!"

It is a little pricey, but if you purchase tickets online you can save a little coin. The ride up and back (we did this twice) was amazing. The views were out of this world. And on top of the mountain, there is still snow, which made the experience that much better. The hiking trails are closed, due to the snow, but that did not hamper our visit. The tram operators also added to the experience and answered all of our questions. We learned that the Fall is the best time to see bears on the mountain, as they prepare for winter. If we ever come back to the area, we will ride again."
534,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017,not available,"Houston, TX ",Amazing Views,"While the cost to take the 12 minute ride on the tram was expensive, it was well worth the cost. The views were amazing. We went on June 5 and unfortunately all trails were closed because of waist high snow. However, it was still worth the cost just for the 360 views."
535,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Saint Louis, MO ",Wonderful view from the Top of the World! (Teton Village),"Enjoyable, picturesque ride up to the top of Rendezvous Mountain.

Lots of opportunity for very amazing photos!"
536,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017,not available,"Sun City West, AZ ",Great views!,"I loved the aerial tram in Jackson Hole (hole here refers to a valley). The tram compartment was large and fully enclosed. The views were panoramic and exhilarating. If you buy your tickets online in the visitor center in Jackson (free wifi), you will receive a $4 discount per ticket. You might want to take a jacket for walking around up top. Don't miss the waffle cafe either -- truly legendary and just the thing after playing in the snow to go with hot chocolate or hot coffee with Bailey's!"
537,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Columbus, OH ",First stop!! Perfect way to start our stay!,"We headed up the mountain first thing on the morning after our arrival - such a fun way to start our trip! It really helped the kids to appreciate the grandeur of this beautiful place. The tram ride is safe yet thrilling. A little crowded but everyone was pleasant and allowed the kids to get to a window to see out. Once we arrived, we headed straight up the steps to truly take it all in: breathtaking views all around. The biting wind kept us from lingering up there, but it wasn't nearly as bad down by Corbet's Cabin, where we all stopped for waffles, of course. Then back out to play in the snow a bit before heading back down the an equally thrilling ride.    Be sure to bring a windbreaker and a camera."
538,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Couples,"Folsom, CA ",Views from the top are amazing,"I would take the tram again in a heartbeat. It allows you to see so much more of the mountains than in the ""hole"". (Jackson Hole) even though others we in the tram, it wasn't crowded so you could look out of all sides to see the valley and mountains. I loved being at the top and just standing still and fully engaging in the solitude of the mountain top."
539,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017,not available, ,Fun and must,"The rude is interesting, a little crowded at a time but over all great experience, the view was amazing throw the ride and up top, the waffle is pretty tasty."
540,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Solo,"Vancouver Island, Canada ",10K feet ride,"Very cool going up and down. At the top, skiers went to do back country skiing. Lots of snow. Views were fantastic. There is a small cafe and store at the top. They are known for their waffles. Cost was $37, a little pricey."
541,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Family, ,Do it!,"Expensive but worth it. The waffles on the top of the mountain are to die for, even in the springtime. It gets chilly on the top of the mountain, so bring a coat. Wonderful, sweeping views though, definitely something to do, especially in the off season."
542,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Couples,"Shakopee, MN ",Top of the world,What an amazing view on a sunny day that was breath taking. Loved the snow and watching the hang gliders. Walked out as far as we could until the snow got to deep. The tram ride up was enjoyable and was informative to the tram and area.
543,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2017 , Family,"Bossier City, LA ",Breathtaking Views!,"Take the tram to the top of Teton Village! You will see some amazing views! And yes, have waffles at the top of the mountain. They are amazing! This is a great attraction and should not be missed! Perfect for people of any age!"
544,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Family,"Berlin, Germany ",Beautiful view - snow in May,"We visited in May after the ski season was over. Weather was perfect sunny. We were wearing winter jackets so we were able to enjoy the snow and spend few ours on the peak - Snowball fight, observing the paraglider lunching. I have seen some ladies wearing flip flops and walking in the snow! Unfortunately all the hiking trails were closed so we had to return by the tram. Be aware of high altitude - and don't forget the sunscreen.    By the way... we didn't like the waffles. They were dry maybe due to high elevation."
545,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Friends,California ,Highlight of my trip!,Winds were 62 MPH. The sound was whistling forcefully through the Tram. But we made it to the top and laughed like crazy as our hair blew all around and we could hardly keep our footing. It was an adventure! Loved it! Gorgeous views!!!
546,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Family,"Houston, TX ","12 mins of fun to 14,000 ft! Amazing view. Worth every penny!","Wear a thick coat! It is cold! 12 mins to the top, get camera ready and get your camera ready! Priceless memories and million dollar view, it is a must do!  One price ticket, you cam ride up and down all day long. 29 dollars for seniors and I think 36 for adults, kid 4 year old ride free.  Enjoy the waffle up top... bacon peanut butter waffle is to die for!!"
547,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Friends,"South Portland, ME, ",Unexpectedly great!,"The tram is very expensive ($34 round trip) so I had doubts if it would be worthwhile going up in May but it turned out to be a really great decision. There was snow still on the mountain and after the 12 minute trip up, you have the fun of walking in snow and seeing the incredible peaks of the Tetons - truly impressive! Make sure you bring a coat up! They said it was a balmy 45 degrees the day we went but the wind chill made it feel much colder! The tram leaves every 15 minutes and allows about 60 people on this time of year so watch your time if you are cold and queue up early! We went up on the 4:45 pm and made it down on the 5:15 pm and felt satisfied with the time spent so don't worry if you get there late in the day! Well worth the views and seeing the crazy trails skiers ski on in the Tetons!"
548,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Friends,"Bradenton, FL ",Awesome,The tram can accommodate 100 hundred people and is a 12 to 15 minute ride to the top of one of the Tetons. Smooth ride and breathtaking views in all directions makes this trip to the top of the mountain an awesome experience. If you are a skier it's a perfect beginning for your dissent. If you were just a sightseer there is not much more to do at the top except drink in the view and maybe have a bite at the waffle house that is there. The dissent is equally breathtaking. Empty cars in the summer but must be packed in the winter. Enjoy.
549,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2017 , Couples,"Seattle, Washington, United States ",Gorgeous views and smooth ride even for fear of heights,Buy your tickets online and save serious cash. The views are spectacular and I am sure the trails are great but for us there was still a lot of snow.  The ride is very smooth and by staying on the end of the car nearest the mountain and looking out the side it did not feel overwhelmingly high.
550,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016,not available,"Westborough, MA ",A great way to see Grand Teton National Park from the top without climbing upg,"We took the tram to the top and did a couple of short hikes at the summit. This is an absolute must do in the area. The tram ride gives you great views on the way up and down, but its really worthwhile taking the short hike around the summit and the hike down to Corbet's Coulier."
551,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Family,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States ",Quick access to the summit,In late March the lines moved quickly and this is your best bet to get to the steep and deep fast. Great views except for short folks like me.
552,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Family,"Austin, TX ",Needs no review,Awesome ride and then terrain at top is obviously great. Easiest if you take a lesson and can use the lesson line.
553,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Family,"Sacramento, CA ",Do it for the views!,"If you're in Jackson Hole you absolutely have to check out the Aerial Tram. Even if you don't plan on skiing down, take the tram up and ride it back down - worth it to see the views!"
554,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Couples,"Los Angeles, CA ",Best Views of Teton Range!,On a sunny day: A must see. Go up. Worth the tingle. Amazing view and if you are hungry grab a waffle on top. Really beautiful.
555,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2017 , Family,"Stockholm, Sweden, ",Best tram in North America,"Reliable service despite windy conditions.The queues may seem daunting, but at relatively nimble.However, no pleasant experience if you are claustrophobic sensations"
556,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Couples,Australia ,Great experience,"The tram is a great experience. Quite a long queue but it moves and it is worth it. Experienced skiers enjoy the challenging descent but those worried about the challenge can take the tram up, enjoy the view from the top and then have the tram almost to themselves for the descent with more great views. On the way up the tram holds 100 people so you don't see much. Don't miss it when you are there."
557,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2017 , Business,"Basingstoke, UK ",Aiming High in Jackson Hole,"Often has a long queue as it opens at about nine. It takes you to the Cabin for breakfast or snacks, then the black diamond minimum descents. Must do look at Corbett's Couloir."
558,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Family,"Malibu, CA ",Great trip regardless if you are skiing or not,The view from the tram is worth taking even if you are not skiing. Views from the peak and a ride down provides a panoramic view of the entire valley.
559,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016 , Family,New York ,Spectacular views and fun hike,"We took the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain in October 2016. We were there on the day of an inversion, where it was warmer on the top than the bottom of the mountain. The tram goes up something like 5,000 feet in 10 minutes. The tram was packed but we didn't care. The views were spectacular for the first part of the ride, then we were in a cloud for about a minute where all we could see was white mist, then above the cloud was like a magical world with mountain tops all around and white clouds as the ground! We got out and had delicious waffles and coffee at Corbet's Cabin, then headed out for a four mile hike, then headed back down the mountain. It was a fabulous day! I would definitely do it again!"
560,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Friends,WorldWide ,The pinnacle of ski transportation.,"Luckily its only a 10 minute ride...cause I'm a little claustrophobic. Its a tight fit ""balls to butts"" to quote a local. The terrain and the views unleashed by this tram are second to none. simply awespme."
561,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Orlando, FL ",Fun visit up the mountains,"The Jackson Hole Aerial Tram is a great option to see the Grand Teton National Park area from the top of the mountains. There is a great view and the Tram is priced in line with most resort trams (granted that means it is pricey, but I have no complaints as I expected this before the trip). We visited in October and there was plenty of snow for us to play and walk in. There is a little waffle store at the top of the mountain. The food is OK, but the hot chocolate with Jameson was more enjoyable.    Make sure you do not forget your camera for some amazing photos. If you plan your day with an early trip, there are some great trails at the top of the tram that provide some additional great views and challenges if you are inclined."
562,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Family,"Hampden, MA ",Family trip,We took the first tram up 3-13-17 and regretted it unfortunately! Don't worry the Tram is awesome we just went to early. The previous day was warm ~40F and then 20F at night so the snow all froze over and was crusty. If this happens to you just wait an hour or two till it warms up and softens up the crusty stuff.
563,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family, ,"Okay tram, great views, perfect food","The tram, as other reviewers have said is a bit packed at times, yet is totally worth the wait. Did not need to wait very long but it was still a wait nonetheless, but w were a bit packed, but could easily see the gorgeous views all around. The ride was quick and smooth with no issues there. The gem of the activity is the waffles at the top, which were nice and warm and delicious, which was nice given that even in the summer it is still cold. Be sure to get the Nutella waffles, as they are by far the best thing there at the top."
564,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family, ,"A definite ""to do"" for the area!",Beautiful experience! Happy they offer a family pass so a family of 6 could enjoy the experience wo a lot of cost. Waffles at the top were amazing. We had the brown sugar ones. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area to visit.
565,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Family,"Hilton Head, SC ",Sardine,Gets you to top of mountain quickly thankfully bc they packed you in so tight that you can't turn around. Be sure to stay by windows.
566,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Granbury, TX ",Nice views from the top and during the ride,"Nice views from the top and during the ride. We enjoyed this attraction, though we did not have to wait in line at all. Nice gift shop in the building at the top. (Our visit was actually September of 2015 and the entire area was unseasonably warm.)"
567,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2017 , Friends, ,"Not great for skiing, nice views, but not worth the wait.",This tram was a waste of time. Almost an hour from start to finish and the terrain wasn't anything special. Save time and just use the lifts.
568,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2017 , Family, ,Fear factor for first timers!,"There is nothing like heading up to the mountain with skis in hand on the tram, full music blasting, and sheer rock cliffs passing underneath you. Often conditions on the base of the mountain are entirely different than those at the peak. So when the tram doors open to wind gusts of snow blowing in every direction, after several warnings (which are routine) but as first timers sends shivers down the spine, you inhale your nerves and exhale as you exit as if ready to conquer the world."
569,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Friends,"Memphis, TN ",Great views,"We really enjoyed the aerial tram. The views are gorgeous. As a bonus, they serve waffles at the top. I recommend the peanut butter with bacon waffle sandwich. Grab a beer at the top and enjoy the view!"

571,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Amarillo, TX ",Incredibly Cool,"The tram is iconic. In the winter it can definitely be intimidating and probably should not be used by less experienced riders and skiers, but it's not to be missed if only for the views that are provided on the way up. It's fantastic."
572,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Hollywood, MD ",What a view!,"Our group decided to head to the summit on the Tram on our last day at Jackson Hole. Some of us were skiing down and some riding back on the Tram. We felt pretty squashed in on the way up, so not as much of a view. But after some hot yummy waffles at Corbett's and a lot of snow and very brisk air (2 degrees and 30mph winds) we headed down. Not crowded at all on the way down and the views were incredible. The ride was part of our lift ticket and it is a must do no matter how you are coming down. Friendly and very informative Tram operator ... definitely enjoyed the experience!"
573,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Friends,"Miami, FL ",JH Tram,Great experience even for non-skiers or snowboarders...views are stunning and Corbet's Cabin at top...great waffles!
574,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Olympia, Washington ","Experience Jackson Hole at 10,446 feet","Take the tram from Jackson Hole up to the top of 10, 446 foot Rendezvous Peak for spectacular view. If heights make you giddy, the ride should still be ok for you as the tram is very stable as it goes up and down. In the summer there are seats, but we were told they remove some for winter visitors to increase capacity. There are one and two way ticket options. The tram line is state of the art. Allow enough time to walk around at the top and eat delicious to order waffles at Corbet's Cabin. After taking the tram I felt like I had experienced the Grand Tetons much better than by walking only in the valley, beautiful as it is. Enjoy!"
575,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Friends,"Charlotte, NC ",Great ride and view,Been coming here for years and even though I can ski down and also take a ride up to enjoy the view and take some pics. The new tram they have now is double the capacity as the old one(100 people can ride up now) Worth the money to go up just make sure it's a clear day to maximize your view.
576,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Friends,"Kemah, TX ",Best View of Mountain,Cannot go to JH and not ride this ! I was skiing so I got a great look of the mountain and the hardest run which is Corbit Coulair
577,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Greater London, UK, ",Expensive but worth it for the scenery.,We got a ticket one way as we walked back down which was excellent but tiring. Think it was 7.2 miles.
578,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Family, ,Spectacular ride to the summit!,The fastest way to the top! Be on the first tram of the day to grab fresh tracks on one of the world's best mountains!

580,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Eyota, MN ",This is a summertime visit review. Skiers you know what you are doing.,"We took the Aerial Tram up to the top and it was a beautiful ride up. Please, heed this review and do not walk down the mountain unless you are well versed on the trail system. Good grief, we wound up walking down the mountain on the gravely service trail and it sucked rocks. My poor feet. Find some decent trails to hike in the Tetons. There are plenty. Save your feet. Don't be a gringo like me and my family. Gah! Oh, don't forget your sunscreen either. The alttude makes a difference!    Just for the life of us couldn't find a decent trail down and the maps were vague. Live and learn, but definately check out this attraction!"
581,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Friends,"Ennis, MT, ",Most Awesome Tram in North America,Best Tram ride in North America by far. Doesn't matter if its winter or summer this bad boy is always running and provides not only the best alpine skiing anywhere but also views like no other.
582,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Family,"Jackson, WY ",A GOOD one time experience,"It's an incredible view, and ride. The price is a big outrages, but realize the cost of operation. Recommend to everyone at least one time."
583,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Family,"Saint Charles, MO ",Awesome ride up,"There was no snow in September, and even then the ride up the tram and the hot coco at the top was so worth it!"
584,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2016 , Family,"Weston, MA ",Love the Tram,Quick way to get to the top--only way to get to the top! I love ski runs from top to bottom and the conditions were awesome in Dec 2016 and Jan 2017.
585,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2016 , Family,"Orange Beach, AL ",GO EARLY ALWAYS CROWDED,"A great tram to get you to the very top of the mountain, but be prepared, always crowded and packed to the brim. Not for the faint of heart. Later in the day you are going to encounter lots of funky smells, sweat, body odors, gas passes so just be prepared. It is very popular and great scenery if you can get next to a window and can hold your nose! Stick to the gondolas, much more fun and less claustrophobic."
586,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2017 , Couples,"New York, New York, United States ",We were the only non-skiers on board,"There was about a 30 minute wait on line after getting our tickets (it's less expensive if you are just sightseeing) and it was pretty frigid during our visit. The thing to do up at the top (besides skiing down) is to get waffles, and everyone had raved about them so we were expecting really great waffles. They were really not great, although everyone was really nice. If you are not a skier and are going DOWN on the tram, it's important to know that you need to stand right on the platform when he tram comes in so you can get in quickly, it only stops for a minute before it goes back down and if you wait in the waffle house until you see the tram you will miss the descent. Besides waffles there's not much up at the Corbett Hut, some fruit, power bars, cookies and some trinkets, hot chocolate and other beverages (including alcoholic beverages)."
587,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2016 , Family,"Frederick, MD ",Great activity for non skiers,"We were traveling with my 90 year old mother and a non skier friend (you don't have a category that fits this group). This gave us an opportunity to see the mountains from another perspective. Although it seems expensive ($20), each ticket could be used for $10 in food at the top so we sat and had light snacks before heading down again. The gondola (we did NOT do the tram because there is no seating or food at the top) staff was very accommodating, stopping it so we could board safely with my mother. The $10 parking fee was annoying and unnecessary."
588,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2016,not available,"Baton Rouge, LA ","Tram trip to the top - Elevation 10,450 ft","We picked today for the ride up because it was a clear day. We arrived at the tram around 11:00 AM and waited for less than 30 minutes to get on board. It was a busy day on the slopes, lots of skiers and quite a few sightseers. The ride up was crowded, but fun - good music playing and everyone was having a fun time.    The view was incredible. The skies were clear, the temp was ~ 20 F and the wind was 20+ mph. Cold, but not unbearable, as we dressed for the occasion.    We had waffles at Corbert's Cabin - they were BUSY, the three ladies working were incredible. They worked hard to get everybody served.    The ride down was even better as there weren't many riders and we could wander around the tram and see in all directions. This is a great way to see one of God's majestic creations."
589,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Perth, Australia ",A must do!,We took the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain and it was a comfortable ride up and down. The views were spectacular and well worth the cost. It was amazing at the top.

591,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016 , Family,"Troy, MI ",This was so much fun.,"One member of our party is terrified of heights and went with us very reluctantly. She ended up going again later in the day as she enjoyed it so much. The driver attendant both time was so friendly and informative. You must have the Cabin waffles in the Cabin at the top of the mountain. They are just delicious and the perfect snack. Although there was no snow in the village we encountered about 6"" at the top. One driver was able to point out a moose on the mountain just below us."
592,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Fairfield, CT ",Really fun,We took the free tram there are two one that is free and it goes halfway up and there is a restaurant at the top of that part of the mountain where you can get drinks and food but it was so crowded we just looked at the fantastic scenery and went back down or you could take the paid tram all the way up to the top which cost quite a bit I think and we did not do that
593,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Nov 2016 , Family,"Reno, NV ",The most unreal views,"What a gorgeous ride, now this was worth the money, this is what Jackson hole was known for...if you have children this is the America you want to show them... Take them to the wildlife refugees while they are still with us and not bought out by the rich and famous from around the world...this is what I remembered from my childhood and this is why I came back..."
594,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,South Jersey ,Wonderful views of the Bridger Teton National Forest,"We took a shuttle from Jackson Hole to Teton Village to climb aboard the tram to the top of Rendezvous mountain. What a ride. I ran from one side of the tram to the other and back again looking for wildlife and views. I didn't get to see any wildlife but the views were wonderful. There are several hiking trails that you can take from the top of the mountain. We didn't, we just went into the snack shop and had a hot chocolate and walked around the top. This was June and there was still plenty of snow. A group of people were shoveling steps and walkways. They were in shirts while we were in warm coats."
595,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016,not available,"Houston, TX ",This is the ride to take!!,"Taking the tram is really great! at the end you can do the short walk to what they call ""The top of the world trail"" which is really a short trail with 360 degree view of the mountains and valley bellow. Also you must try the waffles and hot chocolate that they serve in the little place. If you want to do a great hike you can walk down to the restaurant where the gondola ends."
596,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Nov 2016 , Couples,"Brampton, UK ",Very informative staff,Enjoyed this on two occasions in one day. Buy a ticket and it lasts all day. Went up in the morning and couldn't see a thing for cloud at the top but in the afternoon it was beautiful. Staff were very informative answering any questions people put to them.
597,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Orange, CA ",Fun ride for a beautiful view.,The tram ride up the mountain is worth the price as the view from the top is breathtaking! Not much more to say!
598,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Lansing, MI ",Great Views,"We were hoping to do the three lift experience, but the gondola and chair lifts had already closed for the season. The views from the tram and the top of the mountian are outstanding. There is also a small snack bar at the top that serves drinks and waffles. The time of the ride is 12 minutes each way and the tram leaves from the station every 15 minutes, so you can stay at the top as long as you want.    Tip: The temperature at the base was 55 F and the temp at the top was 34 F, so make sure that you dress accordingly. They say that the temps normally are 10-20 degrees colder at the top of the mountian."
599,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Huntington Station, NY ",Awesome views,Loved taking this to the top. It was snowing heavily so we had some drinks at the cafe at the top and came back down. Totally enclosed tram.

I'm afraid of heights but I focused on the scenery. Absolutely breath taking, beautiful views. We saw 8-9 mule deer walking through the snow of our way up! I would definitely do it again."
601,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016 , Business,"Sun Prairie, WI ",A must do!,"This is an enclosed gondola that goes up the mountain. You get dropped off and can walk around. The views are spectacular!    There is a store you can go into and warm up. They have hot drinks and fancy waffles. It is fun and unique!    Tip: wear boots! I do not know what I was thinking - there was no snow at base of tram, but at top there was 22inches! And I wore tennis shoes..."
602,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016 , Family,nj ,awesome!,"We were exploring the area and ended up in Teton Village at night. I was excited to wake up and see what it looked like in the daytime. The hotel desk person recommended we go on the tram in the morning. It was a beautiful, clear day. The ride in the tram was breathtaking! Be sure to ask in the hotels in they have discount tickets. We got $5 off each ticket. It was much colder up top so dress accordingly. We had waffles and hot chocolate at Corbets- delicious treat! We then learned you can paraglide off the mountain. We would have done this if we had known! It was awesome to watch the paragliders sail by. FYI...I believe it closed for the season yesterday (we were there 2 days ago). Not sure when it opens for ski season."
603,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016,not available,"San Antonio, TX ",Fun,The views from the top on a clear day are wonderful. If you are a family with kids they will love it.
604,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"West Chester, PA ",Fantastic ride and views,Wonderful experience! My husband really wanted to do this tram ride--so we arrived early one morning--bought the tickets and went up to the boarding platform. There was no line to speak of--it was 11:00am on a weekday. The views from inside the tram were amazing--it was a clear and sunny day. Then at the top you can to up to the very top of Rendezvous Mountain and get a 360 degree view. Just beautiful! We are from the east coast--there aren't mountains like this there!! There are also trails to hike down (or up if you are energetic). Or you can just take the tram back down--like most do! There is a waffle house at the top-- great waffles--served cut in half with whatever topping you choose in the middle--then cut into thirds to eat like a sandwich! These would be wonderful if you wanted a pick me up when skiing!
605,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Doylestown, PA ",Highlight of Jackson Hole,We took the tram to the top for amazing pictures and sights that were incredible. I took a video as we ascended the 6 mile high ride. The view is spectacular and I am so glad we took the tram. This is certainly a must if you want to see the view from the top at Jackson Hole.
606,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016,not available,"Alexandria, LA ",Great mountain view!!,Went up twice. A lot colder on top then on bottom. The second time we went up it was 25 degrees and coming a little snowstorm. We loved it. Would def go back again!
607,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Blockley, UK ","Great ride, fabulous views","This is a great way to get to the top of the walls at Teton, or just go for a coffee or beer at the top and come back again. Smooth comfortable ride with nice commentary."
608,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016,not available, ,What a memorable ride!,Alex and Chris talked us into going up even thought it was 37 and raining. Boy where they right! So so worth it. I've been on top of many of a ski mountain in winter but seeing it without the snow was a totally different world. Loved it and sun did peek out for a while. Would you believe they are making Belgian waffles on the on in the world. Happy day.
609,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016,not available,"Moose, WY ","Expensive, but an Experience For Sure!","Besides the cost of the tickets (and the cost at Corbet's Cabin) I would highly recommend this activity to anyone visiting the area! You get unbelievable views and a very unique experience. If you only want to ride one way, you have the option of hiking the rest of the way (I recommend riding up and hiking down rather than the other way around, unless you're up for a very extensive hike!) The Tram operators are friendly, helpful and have some great stories."
610,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Whitesburg, GA ",Loved it!,"Great birds eye view of the whole area. Very smooth ride on a relatively new tram. You can see forever away on the top. If you are adventurous, you can walk down along a ridge line and see a different perspective. Saw people hang gliding off the top. A beautiful view!    A bit pricey but fun just the same."
611,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016,not available,"Singapore, Singapore, ",$37 for ride,"Since I have limited time to hike , I did not take the Aerial tram but walked about the vicinity    I would have love to tram up and walk down to base a journey of 8 miles to chance on the wildlife here.    The lift operates at nine am and is subject to weather conditions obviously !"
612,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Guilderland, NY ","if you are in the area, how do you not go up","It was a beautiful view going up, walking around the top and coming down. But, very overpriced. We went in September and it was in the 40s up there and very windy - bring the hat/gloves/jacket. You'll get some beautiful photos too."
613,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Forney, TX ",A must do when in Jackson Hole!,Great ride up a mountain in a tram. Get out on the top of the mountain and see incredible views. Took so many pictures of the beautiful mountains. I highly recommend this beautiful ride.
614,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Kimberly, WI ",Fun!,An awesome experience that is worth the price. The view from the top is incredible. this is once in a life time!
615,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Portland, OR ","Nice view, but not outstanding","We enjoyed the ride and the view was nice, but if you think you are going to get a great view of the Teton range you will be disappointed. The view of the valley is great, but I am not sure it's worth the price of the ticket. There is hiking at the top, but be aware that all the hikes are downhill from the top rather than up higher. Also, the10,400 feet altitude makes hiking a little difficult. When we came down, we did get a tour of the mechanical room of this amazing aerial tram and that was the most interesting part of the experience. The Swiss precision of this machine was fascinating and the engineer was clearly proud of it and happy to share the inner workings with those who expressed an interest."
616,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Milton, MA ",Incredible views!,This was awesome. 12 minutes to the top and you can see for miles. It was 20 degrees cooler at the top so bring a jacket.
617,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Cleveland, OH ",Go to the top and check it out before deciding on hiking down,"As most of these reviews have stated, the views are excellent and the ride is fun.    Their website, however, really sells you on taking the tram up, and hiking down. This may be good in July and August, but in mid September, it is highly questionable. To add insult to injury, the people who run the Tram are clearly encouraged to recommend bear repellent, at a jacked up price, of course. The temperature was in the mid 60s at the base. At the top, we had 35mph winds and a dramatically lower temperature, resulting in what the tram operator estimated as a wind chill factor temperature near freezing. He mentioned that it is often quite windy at the top. A good number of people, including my wife, were unwilling to leave the tram area at the top, because of the tremendous wind and low temperatures. No one in their right mind was considering walking down the mountain! In the summer, you can walk a shorter distance to the gondola stop, and take that down to the bottom. Unfortunately, they closed the gondola on Sept 1. That wasn't stated on the Jackson Hole website.    Although the people running the tram obviously cannot control weather conditions at the peak, they could easily have mentioned that we probably weren't going to be interested in walking down the mountain. Instead, they recommended that I buy a $50 can of bear repellant, that I had no other use for, and could not bring back on a plane.    Word to the wise- don't purchase the bear repellant until you have checked the conditions at the top. Buy your ticket, walk around the top, and take the tram back down. If you feel comfortable with the weather and the terrain (at the top, the only trail choices are those that are rated as black diamond and strong blue as ski slopes), then buy the bear repellant and go back up. Don't make that decision, however, until you have seen the conditions at the peak.    Jackson Hole could have done a much better job of informing people. I walked away really ticked off,and felt cheated, The attraction is good, and it is unfortunate that failure on the part of Jackson Hole employees created a somewhat negative customer experience."
618,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Minneapolis, MN ",Beautiful views,"Took a late afternoon tram ride, too late to have a waffle on top - darn it! Be aware that the tram can hold up to 100 people. There were probably 30 - 40 people when we rode up, I can't IMAGINE what more would be like! We were lucky enough to be by a window, so had fun watching the climb (and descent). I could feel the altitude a bit, but got my breath back quickly. Beautiful view of the valley! Ride is pricey ($39). Be sure to purchase on-line to save $7.00 per ticket."
619,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Hackettstown, NJ ",Fun trip to the top!,"We enjoyed our trip to the top of the mountain at Teton Village. The price is a bit much, but the view is amazing. Order your tickets online to save a few dollars ($32 instead of $37, I think it was). Just know that the temperature is about 20 degrees cooler up there and can be quite windy. The waffles at the top are a tradition, however they weren't available when we got up there (late in the day). They did have a couple of beers available, including a local brew which we enjoyed. I believe the wristband will allow you to make multiple trips that day, should you want to do that."
620,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Business,"Minneapolis, MN ",Breath Taking Views,I took the Tram up and walked down. It took 3 hours and 45 minutes to walk down at a brisk pace. My quads and calves were sore for several days from the winding downhill trails. The trails are not difficult but the slope is very steep and winding. The views are spectacular.
621,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016,not available,"West Fargo, ND ",Amazing Views!,A little expensive but worth it for the views. Lots of beautiful view from the journey up and from the top. Personnel was very friendly and knowledgeable. A must do!
622,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Solo,"Minnetonka, MN ","Worth it, for the views and quick hike ...","The tram ticket was a bit expensive for what it is (but so is a lot in this area), but it was very enjoyable. We had guides to inform us along the way and it definitely made the experience more enjoyable. It was snowing at the top with gusty winds, but it was great fun. It was cool to see the ski trails without the snow and it gets me excited for ski season. I recommend it if you have an hour or two to spare."
623,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Amazing Views!,This is a must when you visit Jackson Hole. I am not too fond of heights and I have ridden this twice now. The views of the valley are spectacular and well worth me facing my fear of heights. There is a great little waffle restaurant when you get to the top that serves yummy hot waffles and hot beverages that are perfect on the chilly winter days.
624,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,United States ,A bit pricey but worth the views,"My husband I visited the area for our second anniversary. We love hiking and had hiked a ways up near Jenny Lake, but the view were nothing like the ones offered at 10,440 feet elevation. This is a must do if you are in the area. The colors along the snake river are spectacular.    It is a quick jump from approximately 6,000 ft to the 10,000 of the summit via the tram. It takes 12 minutes to reach the top. Take a hike around the trail and be on the look out for wildlife. We saw a beautiful Mule Deer doe and buck.    Word to the wise... There are restrooms atop the summit, but use the ones at base level before making the ascent.    For the more adventurous there are a ton of trails that are accessible from the summit. Time did not allow for this trip but we plan to come back. It is 7.2 miles down from the top."
625,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2016 , Friends,"Windsor, CO ","Yup, It's a tram.",I was on this in the winter so I can't speak to the summer (non-ski) experience. Was it worth the long line and wait? - well... once yes... but would I want to hit it run after run - no. The terrain it accesses is fantastic but its a long line. If your mid-week and there is no line then by all means... but other wise I'd skip the top the work the regular lifts.
626,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Hesston, PA ",Worth the price,"First, the aerial tram is pricey about 40 bucks a head. What you get is a 12 minute ride about 10,000 ft up the Teton range in the midst of Jackson Hole ski resort . The tram is enclosed , top of the line technology and offers breath taking views on the way up and down. A small cafe at the summit along with access to other restaurants . You won't be disappointed , spend a little see a lot"
627,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Alvin, TX ",Great views from the top!,A must do for all sight seeing to the area. Gorgeous views at the top. Was a little windy at 47 degrees when I was there. I tried the waffle and it was good and hit the spot for an afternoon snack. The views from the top make this tram a must do for all ages.
628,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples, ,Jackson Hole Aerial Tram - lovely view,"We hopped aboard the aerial tram and climbed to over 10,000 feet to overlook the mountains and valleys of Jackson and the great Tetons - beautiful. Extremely windy and cold. High altitude made it hard to walk around (use to being at sea levle). Checked out the place - had coffee and then returned to ground floor."
629,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Family,"Washington DC, DC ","great views, and fun trip up the mountain",We took the tram to the top and hiked down over the course of an afternoon. Excellent views and very friendly staff operating the tram. I made a quick second trip up and back later in the evening cause we enjoyed it so much!
630,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Carlsbad, CA ",Please put this on your to-do list!,"This was the last activity on my itinerary before I left Jackson Hole and I’m very happy I did not skip over it! Here’s a tip: purchase tickets on their website for up to $10 off each ticket price.    I didn’t realize this before I arrived, but you can actually take 3 different lifts to the top of the mountain: Aerial Tram to Corbet’s Cabin (10,450’), Bridger Gondola to Gondola Summit & Bridger Restaurants (9,095’), and Teewompt Quad Chair (shortest lift). We ended up taking the Aerial tram to Corbet’s and then hiked to Bridger Gondola, which was about 2.5 mi away using the “Cirque” trail (strenuous/moderate). We stopped into Corbet’s Cabin immediately after exiting the tram because it was FREEZING at the top and I needed hot chocolate and waffles to give me that extra boost of energy. It worked!    There’s really nothing else to do at the top, besides eating waffles, so I highly recommend walking to the next gondola station. For those who have a fear of heights: This cable car is legit. I felt safe the entire time we went UP…and the entire time we went down. Take in the scenery and be sure to take lots of pictures."
631,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Palm Beach, FL ",Love the ride to the top,"Don't miss this ride to the top, the view it's amazing. Once you get the ticket, $37 per person, they put a band on your wrists and you can use it all day long , at least in summer when we went. Don't know the price in winter. You'll have access to the gondolas and chairs as well. Once on top, hike one of the trail, it's a challenge but fun at the same time."
632,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Laramie, WY ",Great views miss the old tram though.,It was fun to see and ride the tram without skis. Beautiful views of the Tetons. I still miss the old tram.
633,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Westport, CT ",the highlight are the tram operators-ours had 20 yrs experience! fun,It's an expensive trip but worth it-it feels unreal that the Tetons and surrounding area could be so beautiful.
634,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Magnolia, TX ",Loved it!,This was a great experience. We ate waffles at the top and had not lines to get on. Staff was friendly.
635,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Tel Aviv, Israel ",Wow!!,"Easy access, senior fare and awesome view!! Take your coat any time of the year!! Missed having a drink at top because of late in season."
636,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,North Carolina ,Nice Ride,"We got there for the first ride of the day, and there was only one other person on the tram - definitely recommend getting there early. We had read the great reviews about the waffle shop at the top, so we planned to have breakfast there. We were very disappointed. The waffles weren't that good, and they were folded in half and placed in aluminum foil, so you ate it like a sandwich. We would have given an excellent rating except for the waffles."
637,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016 , Family,Auckland ,Great views of the Grand Tetons and surrounds,"The Ariel Tram is quite big and can hold a lot of people, average 9-10 minute ride up and down. Fantastic to take photos and lay a claim of climbing an over 10000 feet mountain in a tram, there are trails and you can walk down or up if you have time. It can get quite windy and nippy so might pay to dress appropriately.    There is a waffle spot but we did not try that,"
638,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Longboat Key, FL ",REALLY REALLY HIGH!!,"This aerial tram (only a few years old) is very well thought through. It goes to the top of the Teton's and that is extraordinarily high. Views are breathtaking. In August, temperature dropped 30 degrees. Fun way to spend an hour or so."
639,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,Florida ,Amazing mountain views,We took the tram up to Rendevous Mountain. Initially I thought it was pricey even though we bought our tickets online and saved ten dollars per ticket. But boy was I wrong. The view is worth every penny. It's an experience I will never forget!! Not to mention the out of this world waffles - we had the butter n brown sugar and the Nutella! Without a doubt the best I ever had:). I did feel a little lightheaded when I got out of the tram. But felt better within a few minutes. This is a must do attraction at Teton Village.
640,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",very nice for the ride and the view. Don't forget to taste the wafels,In the summer it is the perfect ride to see the other side of Teton Village. We enjoyed the journey and the come back.
641,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Chicago, Illinois ",Challenging hike,"This is a perfect Sunday morning option. Waffles at the top of the tram and then a hike down. If your knees aren't strong, I wouldn't hike all the way down. The mountain flowers are amazing. We hiked down in June. We carried water, wore caps, lightweight gloves, fleece jackets, and hiking shoes and used hiking sticks. There is no way I would do this without hiking sticks. Bring a camera too, you'll use it. We got to see lots of wildlife too."
642,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2016,not available,"Hemel Hempstead, UK ",What else is there to do in Jackson.,"Actually, it quite expensive. Please go online before hand and save yourself $10 each. Great views from the top and your ticket allows you to use all the lifts as many times as you want."
643,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,"Hemel Hempstead, UK ",Must do in Jackson,"This is a must do if you are anywhere near. Views up top are spectacular. Not much up there except the views and a waffle place where we had a lovely hotel chocolate and coffee and a seat with a view. You can hike to the gondola which takes you back down, or hike the other trails which plenty were doing. We chose to go back down on the aerial tram and did the gondola separately all on the same ticket. Tip - book online beforehand and save $10. We did this outside while waiting for it to open."
644,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,"Covington, KY ",very high!,"I'm afraid of heights, so wasn't too keen on this tram. the other 5 in our party loved it. I must say it was a smooth ride up, but way too high for me!"
645,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Pewaukee, WI ",The tram is worth it,We paid $58 for 2 of us but I would still say it was worth it-----for us the view from the top was only so so because of smoke in the valley from forest fires---but the ride up and down is amazing----if I had a full family I might say it's too expensive --only thing on top is the view----and some go off hiking---and corbetts cabin for the overpriced waffles
646,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"South Bend, IN ",Top of the Tetons,This concession takes you to the top of the mountain and affords visitors a 360 view of the area. Absolutely gorgeous!!! Ride up takes about 12 minutes and is not cheap but worth it. We hiked down to the gondola for the ride back and had a beautiful walk down the mountain with wildlife (bears) and stunning views!! For the less adventurous you can ride the tram down as well. A fantastic way to see the top of the Tetons!!
647,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,"Houston, TX ",The only way to see the views!,"We spent the day in Teton Village. From taking the aerial tram up to hiking down to the gondola. Beautiful hike through rocks, meadows, flowers, trees and enjoyed a beer on the patio.    Then the group split up. Some did disk golf, some did bikes, some did the rope course, some did bungee....all in all excellent day spent."
648,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,Wigan ,See the beauty of the Tetons,"We spent a great morning on the three tram rides (all part of one ticket) in the Teton Village, the Big Red Tram journey took us very high into the Teton Mountains . If you suffer from altitude sickness you might need to think about this trip as many people seemed to be affected at the summit. The views are fantastic and the top of the Bridger Gondola is a great place to relax in the sun for half an hour. Really enjoyed our half day on the trams."
649,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Friends,"Charlotte, NC ","Spectacular view, not for the timid hiker","The ride up was great. You should check for the weather at the top. It was definitely cooler but the real factor was the wind which was blowing at 35 mph, which defiant  Yeah made it cold My group wanted to do some hiking and there are paths and trails. They voted for,the trail. I would have been more comfortable on the path as the trail was steep and narrow in areas. We hiked from the tram to the gondola. Also when planning your trip,you should check to see if tram is operating as it was closed to public for private events 2 days while we were there."
650,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Philadelphia, PA ",Breath taking and rememberable,It is completely worth the $40 to go up. The view is stunning and the staff working the tram are energetic. I suggest taking the gondola up to the big restaurant and having a couple cold ones on the deck!
651,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Woodbridge, CT ",Spectacular views!,Well worth the ticket cost for the fun ride and the absolutely amazing views from the top of the peak. You can hike from the tram down to the gondola as well for some mountain trekking fun. Or you can just take the team back down.
652,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,North Carolina ,Great day out,Buy your ticket online - $32. You can go up and down the gondola/tram/ski lift as many times as you want. Wonderful views and a nice restaurant at the top to have a glass of wine and chill out taking in the views.
653,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",So much fun!,"We hiked (with kids) from the Gondola to the Tram. Trails were v poorly marked though, and the liftees (at the Gondola) had no clue. Saw lots of marmots and moose on our way down. Loved the waffles at Corbet's."
654,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Blue Ridge, GA ",Super fun... Do both the Tram and the Gondola,"We love the Jackson Hole/Teton Village area and riding the Tram and Gondola are must do fun things when in this area. We were lucky to have a beautiful sunny day and it wasn't super crowded at all despite a lot going on in Teton Village. It really is 15 degrees cooler up on the Mountain so bring a fleece just in case. For the money, this is a really good value too."
655,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Fort Collins, CO ",An enjoyabe but pricey diversion.,"Nice views of nearby peaks, the valley and the Snake River but definitely not world class when compared against vistas from many other ski resort trams, e.g. the views from Aspen Mountain in Colorado. Disappointing that you can't see the Grand Teton from the top. Nice hiking opportunities from the top."
656,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Idaho Falls, ID ",Expensive for a 1 hour ride!,We live close to Jackson and always suggest this to friends when they come to visit. I was disappointed to see the huge price increase for summer. It is a beautiful view but not worth $45.
657,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ",Skip this unless you have nothing else to do,"We took the gondola ride up to the restaurant at the top. If you have ever taken a ski lift, you have seen similar views. And, at 40$ per person, it was expensive. Also, the restaurant does not offer a lot of variety in food choices. Honestly, if you have explored the Grand Teton National Park, there is no need to waste your money because the views there, even from the ground, are many times more breathtaking."
658,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Yorba Linda, CA ",Beautiful view at a price,"The tram to the top at 10,750 feet takes 12 minutes an is dbeautiful high in a little bit frightening. The most frightening part is the cost $41 a person. At the top there is a restaurant many hiking trails and their famous waffles."
659,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Mickleton, NJ ",Worth it!,"Beautiful views. Hiked down the Cirque Trail to the top of a lower lift with restaurant at top. Saw mule deer, marmots, and pika. We took our time and hike was a couple hours. Hiking boots recommended."
660,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Bloomington, MN ",Must Do!,"Crazy engineering. expensive however, must have the waffles at the top- go early to avoid crowds. Lines form for the first ride 15 mins before it departs."
661,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Loomis, CA ",Get the discount,"I didn't know if the tram would be worth $42 each. There are $5 off flyers everywhere but if you buy online you can get $10 off each ticket. The views are spectacular. Lots of trails at varying skill levels. The ticket is good for the gondola and quad chair as well as the tram. You have to get a picture at the ""top of the world"". 10,400 feet up."
662,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,"Sioux City, IA ",Fantastic Views!,We saved $10 per person by booking tickets online which was well worth it. It's a nice smooth ride up the mountain with fantastic views. It's enjoyable for all ages!
663,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,washington dc ,save $ go on gondala,If you want to experience going up in tram but don't have the funds ride on the gondola instead after 4:30pm. It is free. It doesn't go as high as the airel tram but it is still fun. I think they can hold up to 6 people. It takes you to about midway as far as airel tram. There is a restaurant up top and views are great. You dont have to get anything at restaurant. Either ride gondala back or hike back down. Ride takes about 10 minutes
664,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Valrico, FL ",Breathtaking Views,"The aerial tram ride offers amazing views. My daughter and I are extremely motion sick, so we were a little worried about the ride itself. There was nothing to be concerned about. The ride is extremely smooth except for a couple of bounces at the towers, which the guides always warn about. Great photo opportunities. The waffles at the top of the mountain were good, but attracted bees."
665,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Orlando, FL ",Fantastic views,"Although the tram ride is expensive, it provides the best views in Jackson price of the tram ride also includes the nearby gondola, so be sure to do both."

667,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Carmel, IN ",Great view from the top of the world!!!,"We didn't know what to expect after we got on the tram. But thought it would be a neat ride to the top of Teton Mountain. On the way up we looked down and saw a moose in a stream! The view was amazing after we arrived at the top. The hiking was challenging 10,500 feet but very enjoyable and recording. The wildflowers were out, they were small but all variety of colors shapes and sizes. This is a definite thing to do if you're in the Jackson area and have an opportunity to go to the grand Teton Village and ride the tram to the top for a great experience."
668,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,"Jonesborough, TN ",Order Online to Save & Enjoy,"We had a day of relaxation planned between visiting parks and this was one of the things we did. Reading others' reviews on here showed that we needed to definitely pre-order our tickets for a much cheaper price, so I did it quickly that morning on my phone while eating breakfast. The first tram departs at 9 but they are opened before then. (On the drive there we were able to see our first moose alongside the road.) We were two of maybe 10 people on the tram up (holds 100 so PLENTY of room). Most were planning to hike and if we had known about their well-marked trails then we would have done this earlier in our stay. A fox that has been residing at the top was there to greet us when we arrive, about 200 feet away. It hung around most of the time we were up there. We just went for the view and experience so we only hung around maybe 30 minutes before riding back down (this time two of three people on the tram, lol).    With your ticket, you can ride the tram all day if you want and you also have access to the gondolier to ride. We walked around small Teton Village for a bit before riding the Bridger Gondola up and getting a coffee."
669,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Wv, ",Views from the top,"If you are a family, be sure to get the family pass, because even with 1 child that has to pay, it is cheaper. We got unlimited tram rides, Teewinot chairlift and gondola included, but only took the tram 1 time. If you are a senior or short on time it is a good way to get up high to view scenery. Wildlife was limited to 1 mule doe. It is windy and colder on top, so be prepared. There are 360⁰ views that are good. We probably would not do this again with the family, but would with my senior relatives."
670,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Scottsdale, AZ ",Great views led to a great hike,"Look, the tram IS expensive, at $42 per person. We sucked it up, rode it up, and walked around the top for the expansive 360 degree views. Instead of taking the 12 minute ride back down, however, we took the 3.5 mile hike down to the gondola (which is free with the tram ticket). The hike was great -- easier going downhill than up, but there was plenty of work to do, especially on a couple of steep pitches or narrow trails. Suggest you take the trail down if you do go up!"
671,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family, ,amazing views,"this is a great place to see amazing views of Grand teton peak and valley, but the price is too steep . it is better to buy the tickets on line, you will save 10$ for each ticket , rather than buying at the attraction, It takes 15 minutes to go up and 15 minutes to go down and views are great. They have waffles on the top of the peak, the price is 8$ for each waffle, it is little too much for it, but the fact that they were made at an altitude of 10000 feet and tasted good.It is better to take a light jacket or fleece pull over , since it is very windy up there and they have nice clean bath rooms up there . You can take unlimited number of rides up and down and also the ticket includes to use gondola ride and ski lift rides."
672,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Edina, MN ",Great Views!,Took the Tram to the top. Great Happy hour with live music. Husband and son hiked further to the top. A great afternoon with great views! A must do!
673,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,"Manchester, UK ",On Top of the World looking down on Jackson Hole,"This is a really excellent trip from Teton Village, for $35 if you booked online. You travel,over 4000ft to the top,of one of the mountains of the Teton range, views are stunning although weather dependent. There is a little cabin at the summit which serves waffles and coffee. You can hike down to the gondola station but this is not for the faint hearted. This a great trip worthwhile for the 360 views."
674,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Kingston, MA ",Beautiful views of the surrounding valley,"We purchased our tickets ahead of time before we left home and picked them up at the will call window. We were early so we had no people waiting in front of us for the ride up the mountain. However, there is a long line that develops as suggested by the railings and movable ""lane"" markers. The ride up/down is about 12 minutes. It was windy, but not too cold at the top. We did not need our coats. I did get a waffle and boy was it good! Perfect peanut butter with bacon waffle! I'm not a waffle person, so that's huge praise! The ticket that we purchased allows access to the other gondola lift, but we did not opt for any other activity except for the Tram. You can take your bike and ride down certain parts of the mountain and also hike if you like. There is a ropes course that is offered as well. The view from the top is amazing!!!"
675,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016,not available, ,Amazing views,"This was a great choice. The wait was at a minimum when we purchased out tickets. We loved the ride up the mountain on the Aerial Tram, the view going up was great. The view was magnificent when we arrived at the top."
676,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Tampa, FL, ",Great way to spend an hour or two,"For our family of five (mom, dad, 11-year-old, 8-year-old, and 4-year-old), we ordered our tickets on-line, ahead of time, to get a $10 discount on the family pass ($75 vs. $85), which covered two adults and up to four kids. We had to indicate which date we wanted, but then after we ordered, it said the ticket could be used within 7 days of the date indicated. We had a little trouble finding it at first -- park for free at the Base camp, and the tram departs near the Clock Tower.  The tram runs every 15 minutes, on the quarter-hour. There are 2 trams constantly running back and forth, and so in theory your wait should never be more than 15 minutes, but because only approximately 100 people are allowed on at a time, we noticed a line forming by the time we left (noon), and so I recommend getting there early. We arrived at about 11am and had no wait before boarding the tram.  The tram takes you to the top of the mountain, at about 10,500 feet; that's about 4,000 feet above the elevation of Teton Village. For perspective, the nearby Teton mountains are about 13,000 feet.  The ride each way takes about 10-12 minutes. If you're afraid of heights, you can stand in the middle of the tram and not be near the outside; there is also some seating, but it is limited (probably seating for only 30 people total). Be warned that as you go up the tram to the top of the mountain, each time you pass a support pole, the tram slows down just a bit and swings back and forth like a pendulum as you pass by; it can be a little surprising, particularly for those you do not like heights to begin with. If you're not afraid of heights, be sure to look out the tram for wildlife; the people in our tram saw a moose below while riding up.  At the top, there is an area to walk around and take in the views. If you have kids, you will probably be nervous the whole time that your kids will slip and fall off the mountain. We spent about 45 minutes up top before we were ready to head back down (we passed on the waffles).  It wasn't as cold at the top as I thought it would be. We wore coats/sweatshirts and jeans, but honestly, a light jacket and shorts would have been just fine. Not that we were overly hot, but I definitely didn't need the sweatshirt. (This was early August.)  The ride back down was similar to the ride up, although perhaps a little scarier for the first part coming down.  To give you a sense of timing: We arrived at about 10.55am, waited in line for 10 minutes to pick up our pre-purchased tickets, boarded the 11.15am tram up, boarded the 12.00pm tram down, arriving back down at the mountain at 12.15pm. If you're in a hurry, you could probably spend as little as 30 minutes (or perhaps even 15 minutes). I thought the tickets were a little pricey if purchased individually ($42 each for adults, I believe), but $75 for my family of 5 was well worth it.  We didn't do any of the other activities at Teton Village (bungee bounce, frisbee golf, rock climbing), but after comparing it with Snow King Mountain Resort in Jackson, I would say the Teton Village facilities were much nicer."
677,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family, ,Good but not great,"The views from the top of the tram are spectacular, the whole valley is visible from Jackson all the way to Jackson lake. The tickets are a little pricey but are good for the other open lifts as well. There are endless hiking opportunities from the top as well which also makes it l worth. Overall if you are okay with spending a little extra money and have some time then it is very worthwhile."
678,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Yeovil, UK ",Great end to our visit,"After a grea day out at Jenny Lake with a boat tour, this trip really finished off a wonderful day, weather was perfect at the summit, made the expansive views a wonder to the eyes."
679,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Loved This Beautiful Ride,We took the whole family up with a picnic lunch. There was a table with incredible views and we had a delightful lunch. We hiked just a short loop as we had small children but I would love to go back and do some more hiking. Buy tickets on line and save $10 per ticket.
680,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Friends,"New Berlin, NY ",Fun! Awesome views!,"I am not much for heights, but was relatively comfortable on the trip up, you can always look in another direction. It is amazing to look out and see all the mountains around you. Be prepared for cooler temps and if you plan on doing some hiking wear sturdy shoes, to keep yourself steady on the steep inclines with lots of rocks. The day we went was smokey as Cliff Creek and Berry fires were active."
681,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Northbrook, IL ",Summer Fun,"We took the tram to the top of the mountain, 10,250 feet. Stunning vista and onoly took 7 minutes. Scott was our tram driver. Super knowledgeable about the mountain and how the tram was built. When you are up there go to Coorbets for a drink and waffle."
682,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family, ,Great views,"Our family had a great time going to the top of Mt. Rendezvous. The views were amazing. However, the pricing was high. It's a far better deal for a family to get the day family pass, where you can ride the tram, gondola, and one of the ski lifts unlimited for under $100. Otherwise, a cool experience!"
683,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2016 , Family,new york ,amazing views,"something you have to do, you feel on top of the world, spend a few hours and hike around. The waffles in the warming lodge are actually very good."

685,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Cold Spring, MN ",A beautiful ride to the top of the mountain,This was one of the highlights of our trip taking the tram to the top of the mountain and the ticket also includes the gondola ride if you want to try that. The views are amazing at the top and the ride to the top goes pretty quick. I would recommend this if you are in Jackson.
686,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Crazy expensir,"Teton village needs to rethink their pricing model of their gondola, tram and chair lifts. They don't allow you to buy individual tickets, it's an all or none ticket. They should offer a scenic ticket for just the tram or gondola at least in the summer. They might want to think about discounts when there's a huge amount of smoke covering the area due to all the fires."
687,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2016,not available,"Elmhurst, IL ",Great views,$42 for a day pass is pretty steep (pun intended). But it's worth it. The view from the top is amazing. We had waffles for breakfast at the waffle shack on top which I highly recommend.
688,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Merrill, WI ",Best way to explore the mountain,We tried the Aerial Tram on day 5 of our vacation. After 3 days of hiking my parents in their 70's had enough of hiking. The tram was the best way to get a great view without much walking. The waffles at the restaurant on the top of the mountain are a must try!! The best value is buying your tickets for the tram downtown Jackson Hole. We saved over $60.00 at the Jackson Hole store right across from the square or buy them online. If you have young kids buy the package that includes the ropes course and gondola.
689,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Miami, FL ",Nice day trip,Spent the day exploring the resort. The tram ride was nice with great views and hiking at the top. The views from Piste were great too. Our daughter enjoyed the ropes course. Unfortunately the drop wasn't in service. Horseback riding on site was a nice experience too.
690,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Point Pleasant, NJ ",First day trip in Jackson Hole,Did this first when we arrived.....hike on top of mtn....literally took our breath away...cant believe skiers begin their treks here.....awful steep....
691,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Friends, ,Don't go if you're not a fan of heights!!,This takes you way up! Get waffles and whiskey at the top. Don't be afraid to ask the operator questions. Ours was great. Had a fun time.
692,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Martinsville, IN ","Great ride, views and food at the top",Took family to the top for views and some hiking. Price was pretty steep even with ability to go many times the same day but was worth it if going hiking up top. Hot chocolate and waffle selection up top added to the overall experience and should be seen at least one time.
693,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Coral Springs, Florida ",Spectacular views,"It was so exciting to ride the tram. I do not like heights so it was a real challenge for me, but my family loved it. Once you get to the top, remember to bring a jacket or sweater, the temperature difference is an easy 15 degrees."
694,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Snoqualmie Pass, WA ","Not the worst, not the best","We decided to head up the tram for a different view of the mountains. While at a high elevation and a different view, it wasn't THAT spectacular, just a different view of the mountains. You DO have to have a waffle once you're at the top!    Purchase your tickets online, even if in the parking lot-it will save you $10/ticket. The ticket will get you onto the other lifts. I wouldn't bother unless you want to eat and drink on the mountain.    We've had better views from the Gondola in Glenwood Springs, CO and Crystal Mountain in Washington State (great views of Mt. Rainier!)"
695,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016,not available,"Lake Mary, FL ",Beautiful views for an outrageous fee,"We went on the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram in July 2016. The views at the top were spectacular, but we were shocked to be hit with a $42 fee for a quick ride to the top. They did have some family packages which lowered the price a bit, but those travelling on a budget should avoid this attraction."
696,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Sandusky, OH ",AMAZING VIEW...for a high price,"Cost us $95 for a family pass, 2 adults/3kids (and only because the kid at information said we could get a family pass even though one of our kids was too old...ticket lady wanted to charge us $135)    Views from up top were SUPERB...but costly, in my opinion.    We only stayed up top 15 minutes. (Would've liked to try the waffles at the restaurant up there but the line was too long)"
697,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Estero, FL ",Breathtaking views!,"We took the tram in Teton Village up Rendezvous Mountain. We were not disappointed! This is a must do if you're in Jackson Hole. The views from the top offer a whole different perspective on the area. Stunning! Drink plenty of water and be prepared, as the air is noticeably thinner at the top of the mountain. Dress in layers. It was about 15 degrees cooler at the top also, and windy at times. But absolutely gorgeous. We want to do it again!"
698,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Singapore, Singapore ",A worthwhile ride,A great way to see an aerial view of Teton National Park. A ride up to the top is smooth and seeing the mountain ranges is just stunning. Enjoy the trails while up in the summit.  Try the waffles at the Corbet's Cabin. Is good.
699,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Barrington, RI ",Beautiful Views,We took the tram ride up to the top. The views were amazing and we had a beautiful but blustery day. Have layers because the top is much colder than at the base. The ride was $95.00 for 3 of us (2 adults/1 child) but it was worth it. You can ride it and the gondola as many times as you like on the day of purchase. You can also hike down if you like.
700,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016,not available,belmont nc ,Great views. A little pricey,"If you're into views but don't want to hike to see them this is the way to do it. The ride was shorter then was is posted it seemed. The top was pretty. Not much there other then the small building with outhouse style bathrooms and a small coffee and waffle place. They had adult beverages to add to cocoa and coffee. The waffles were underwhelming based on other's reviews. Small, cut in half and filled with your toppings. The view was incredible. Some hikers took the tram up and hiked down. We were told you can occasionally see wildlife from the tram."
701,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"San Antonio, TX ",Breathtaking View of Tetons,"A must do if you are a first time visitor to the Teton area. Provides breathtaking views of Jackson and the mountains. Not sure I'd do it again, now that we've seen it. But should definitely make the time if this is your first visit, just for the view alone."
702,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Austin, TX ","Pretty expensive, pretty ride","If you are going to spend the $, schedule time to walk the trails up top to check out the wildflowers and other peaks, or also take the included fee for the gondola ride for different view. Just going up and down for that much $ makes it something like an expensive carnival ride."
703,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Friends, ,Just plain fun,"Mid July, the views are spectacular. The Gondola can hold up to 100 people (yeah, that's what I said) but they usually take only about 25 at a time. It's simply amazing.    From the Gondola, we saw bear, deer, marmot... lots of visually stunning views of the Grand Teton and the valley below.    At 10,400' elevation, unless you're used to higher elevations (like you're from Colorado) prepare yourself for a little less oxygen than normal. Breathe deeply!"
704,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Orange County, CA ",Breathtaking views!,"Always enjoy this tram ride and the sweeping views. Cool,and windy at the top - about 10,400 ft. Minimal hiking around the top, but you can hike over to the Gondola lift - about 3 miles or hike to the bottom over 5 miles. But I always under estimate this mountain. Between altitude and heat It is easy to become exhausted. Saw a few families struggling on the trails with small children. The trail may be moderate, but the sun can be merciless. Love this mountain, but really know your ability when deciding to hike down. Many young people hike both up and down, but they are experienced hikers. Fun activities for kids at the base."
705,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Beware the 'easy' hike!,"We took the tram up and took advantage of the family pricing. Still cost us almost $100 for 6 people. The tram ride was nice but we took advantage of being up there and hiked from the tram across the Cirque trail to the gondola. We were told it was an easy hike - which to us meant a stroll across the mountain. While it wasn't super hard, it was by no means easy! There were some very steep and rocky parts that made it treacherous at times. We enjoyed it but were not prepared for this first hike of our trip! We stopped at the restaurant at top of the gondola and enjoyed the views before heading back down. All in all, a fun afternoon!"
706,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016,not available,"Los Angeles, CA ","For the great overview of Tetons, don't miss.","Gives a great perspective on the 'Hole"" that is Jackson - after being IN the park, touring, seeing Yellowstone and the animals, this was a whole different perspective on the beauty that is Wyoming."
707,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016,not available,"New Jersey, ",Fabulous view,"The tram ride itself was really not that long and pretty much what you would expect. It was cool looking out across the mountains and valleys while suspended in the air, but the real treat was when you reached the top of the mountain. The views were spectacular...just unbelievable! There was a little lodge up on the top of the peak that sold waffles and provided some shelter. Half our party decided to hike the 7.2 miles back down the mountain and the other half of our party took the tram back down admiring all the scenery along the way."
708,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family, ,Breathtaking views,"Wow - we had a great time. The tram ride is awesome...it wasn't crowded, which was good because we had my 15 month old grandson with us. Once you get to the top, the views are amazing...I would definitely recommend this to people of all ages!"
709,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Loveland, OH ",Glad we did not skip this!,We were wavering on this one because the price was a little steep for our family of five. I am really glad we splurged because the kids agreed this was a highlight to our vacation. We could have stayed up there all day taking in the sights. You have to get the waffles at the summit... Trust me.
710,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Cottage Grove, WI ",Pleasant,"As shaky as some trips to the top can be, this one is smooooooth! With a 360 degree view from inside the tram, you can enjoy the landscape and learn some fun facts from the operator. Once at the top, enjoy a delicious waffle and take a hike around the top."
711,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Moline, IL ",Worth the price and the hike down,"We took the aerial tram to the top of the mountain and completed the Cirque Trail to the Bridger Gondola. The hike was incredible – it is a little strenuous in parts so not for everyone. A discount was available on the tickets if pre-purchased online; when we mentioned this discount at the window they honored that discounted price, saving us $20. Remember it is about 20 degrees cooler on the top so remember to bring a jacket. Our hike down was fantastic and we saw several pikas, birds, chipmunks, and marmots. There was an excellent abundance of wild flowers and there were several places that still had snow. Well worth the hike and the trip up on the aerial tram. At top they were serving warm waffles that smelled delicious but we had lunch before going up – wish I had waited to enjoy these."
712,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Couples,"New Bern, NC, ",Pretty view but expensive,"We did this on our last day in town. It had been smoky all week but cleared enough for us to decide to go up. The view is great but if we returned, we wouldn't need to spend the money again."
713,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Orlando, FL ",Worth the money,"Three of us (two adults, one child) took the aerial tram to the top of the mountain and completed the Cirque Trail to the Bridger Gondola. A discount was available on the tickets if pre-purchased online; we did the pre-purchase in the parking lot and saved $30. The line to get our wristbands was short and we were on the next tram; time between parking lot and the tram leaving the station was probably 20 minutes or less. The tram ride was enjoyable and we went with the plan that we would be hiking down after picture taking and a waffle at Corbett's Cabin. The temperature at the top was less than 60 degrees and delightful! The views were great and the waffles were delicious. Our hike down was good and we spotted some pikas and marmots along with an abundance of wild flowers. We took our time and made it to the Bridger Gondola in less than two hours. The deck had drinks and appetizers; we enjoyed a beer and a soda from the walk-up bar. The patio was quite busy and it appeared that all of the tables were full. The gondola ride down was fast and also scenic.    We highly recommend this for an afternoon activity. We visited the same day that we arrived from Florida and the mountain air combined with the cooler temps and physical activity really got us in a vacation state of mind."

Tickets are quite expensive, so buy online for $10 discount. If you have health issues or are older, you may want to save this for your last day in JH to avoid issues with altitude. Hydrate well to avoid dizziness. Hiking up there is strenuous, so plan accordingly.    Tip: after 4:30 pm, the Bridger Gondola is FREE, so you can opt to take that instead for great views and snacks/drinks before sunset. Also, sun sets behind you as you are looking into the valley, so best to ride up just after 4:30."

719,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Navarre, FL ",Great exoerience,"We did the tram up to the peak then hiked to the gondola for the ride down. The tram is spacious, runs every 15 minutes and had seating if needed. Great views on the way up and plenty of room even in July. We did the hike on summit trail rather than cirque to the gondola. The summit trail is nice but some steep declines and inclines. Not strenuous but not easy either - just short of 3 miles and 35 flights by fit bit. Took 2-3 hours to get to the gondola. Piste cafe had nice warm food selections for a quick meal and great deck dining if weather is in your favor. So a good place to revive before your ride down to Teton village."

Really, if you've traveled that far already to see the Tetons, then you won't be disappointed. When we went up, it was 90 degrees at the base and in the 30s at the top- and rainy. Take a jacket. Love seeing a little snow on the summits in June! The cabin at the top offers drinks and a few eats. Advice: steer away from their cider- it's just awful. Watch for wildlife on the way up and down- that's where we saw our one and only moose."

There is a good waffle place on top that's a lot of fun as well. I would have rated it higher, but the price keeps up from a full thumbs up.    Bottom line, it gets you to the top of the mountain and that is worth it! It's also a good way to get those with fear of height up there. The size makes it more comfortable and other than the occasional swing at the poles, it's pretty steady and smooth."

There is a restaurant where you can get waffles but we didn't try it as we had just had our breakfast. It is considerably cooler at the top and like most of Wyoming, very windy. We choose to go early in case there were the typical afternoon thunderstorms. (They will close the tram if there is inclement weather.) We paid $95 for a family pass (2 adults and 2 kids.)

Bring a jacket as it is 20 degrees cooler up there.  2) Gondola takes you to larger restaurant area around 8500 ft. Beverages and a deck complement the visit.  3) Chair lift can get you out in the open for a shorter ride."
731,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2016 , Family,"Billings, MT ",Much cooler at the top,Fun ride. We saw Marmot playing and deer on the way up and down along with the beautiful views. REALLY cold at the top on the day we went although it was warm on the ground. The day before we tried to ride but they close the tram if there is lightening within 8 miles. They were really nice and gave a refund. They  honored the internet discount from their website although we did not purchase on line.
732,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Friends, ,Great Views,Great views at the top of the mountain. Great for family and friends for a group photo. I would love to go up again. Price is reasonable as it includes the gondola too.
733,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Hollywood, FL ",A Bit Expensive but Lots of Fun,"I went up with my family of five (13, 11, 11). I'm afraid of heights but was ok until the very end. I got through it. It was worth it! There was still snow on top of the mountain so my kids had fun in the snow. The views were awesome! There's a cute waffle shop on top you should check out. I can't believe people ski straight from the top."
734,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,Wellington ,"Awesome experience, signage for walks could be improved","We were so glad we did this. The tram up was great and there was snow around the place which the kids enjoyed walking through. It was pretty cold and windy at the top, we needed our jackets and woolly hats.    There are several hiking trails up the top including a walk to Lake Marion which sounded good if we'd had more time. Instead we went towards Cody bowl and along top of the world to the other gondola. Best to have a map and gps as there is very little signage. There were patches of snow covering parts of the track so it was hard to follow. Others were having trouble finding the way to go as well.    We enjoyed the awesome views, playing by the an ice covered lake, spotting ground squirrels, and the waffles. Would definitely recommend exploring the area at the top of the tram."
735,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Solo,"Cayuga, NY ",Amazing,"The ride up is about 12 minutes and the scenery is beautiful especially with the snow capped mountains and you can see all of teton village going up and down the tram..one ticket is good for all day and includes the tram,gondala and ski lift...small warm cabin at the top with delicious hot chocolate and home made waffles... Definite yum!!"
736,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family, ,Beautiful views,"The tram provides a beautiful ride to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. While it was pricey($80 for the family), it is a don't miss for the views. We rode the tram up in the morning and hiked down the mountain. We then rode back up later in the day. Beautiful to see how the light changes the scenery through the day. The best part was walking around in snow and having a snowball fight in June while at the top!"

It's a nice slow ride either round trip or up to the top. There is a restaurant and snack bar that has good food and drinks. A fun way to watch the sunset. I don't like heights but the tram was fine!
739,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,Texas ,Smooth ride,"The tram takes you up to the top of the ski area; still some snow up there in late June. About a 12-13 minute ride, very smooth and safe. Up there you can walk around and explore a bit; restaurant up there serves fantastic waffles."
740,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Rutland, VT ",DO IT!!!,"My family of 6 decided, on a whim, to take this Tram to the top of the Tetons and let's just say it is breathtaking. It's about a 12 minute ride with hiking trails and endless photo opportunities! Not to mention, once you're on top, indulge in some of the best waffles you have ever tasted. The crew is great and we even watched some people jump off the mountain and parachute down. You could spend 30 minutes up there or a few hours! We loved it and so will you."
741,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,Ludlow ,Beware the Price,"We didn't do the tram or other cable rides as you can only buy one ticket for all three lifts which lasts for the day. 42 dollars per person. When we declined the price, we were offered a 5 dollar peg person reduction, and when we declined that, were told there is a happy hour free ride at 4.30."
742,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Pleasanton, CA ",Views and more views,We had a nice day just admiring the great views. We went in the early summer and it was a beautiful day. Great pictures! This Tram is the first of this kind in the USA .
743,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family, ,Ride up the Tetons,Absolutely stunning views both from the Gondola and the Tram. Great waffles on top of the Tram stop. Great restaurant accessible on top of the Gondola stop. well worth it.

746,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Friends,"Jackson, WY ",WOW,What an experience! I was in Teton Village to go paragliding (Jackson Hole Paragliding) and was lucky enough that the winds were so light and I was able to do the tandem from the summit! Whole experience was amazing!
747,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2016 , Couples,"Glen Allen, VA ",Breathtaking view of the surrounding Tetons and the valley below,"Happened to see a coupon offer in the local media to experience this breathtaking view of the Grand Tetons. You go up to approximately 10,500 feet in an enclosed aerial tram which offers you a 360° view of the surrounding countryside. The weather can be nippy up at the top and you should dress accordingly depending upon the time of the year. When we went, there was still a good deal of snow at the summit and some people decided to ascend even higher to experience the snow effect. If you are a veteran or active military, be sure to inquire about an appropriate discount for your valued service. This was an amazing experience for four seniors who have never attempted something of this nature in the past."
748,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,"West Palm Beach, FL, ",Excellent ride,This was one of our highlights. The tram is smooth. Views form the top are excellent. There was still some skiing in the summer. You can even paraglide down the mountain. Great way to spend several hours.
749,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2016 , Couples,"Los Angeles, CA ",Big tram....not scary at all!,"Warning - kind of pricey (think adults were $37) so look in town for $5 off coupons for your party. This is a big tram so the most motion you'll feel is when it crosses sport towers. Didn't open till Memorial Day weekend because the trails at the top were still mostly snow. You can get a great waffle for breakfast at Corbet's Cabin at the top while you enjoy the views. I believe it's over 10,000 at the summit."
750,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Friends,"Fort Worth, TX ",Don't miss this!,"Friends recommended this activity, and we are so glad we did it! My sister is afraid of heights, but the tram is big enough to sit away from the sides (she was fine and kept looking forward). The ride is fairly smooth and offers amazing views, with trams every 15 minutes you can stay as long as you want. Lines get long around mid-morning, so we recommend going early - and dress warmly! Temp can be more than ten degrees cooler at the top, and the wind makes it even cooler!"
751,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,MN ,FUN!,We had a blast going on the tram. $88 for 2 adults 2 children was worth it. The kids had a blast and they enjoyed the waffle house. The view is awesome!
752,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family, ,Totally worth the money!,"We are from Florida and my kids absolutely loved playing in the snow! It was chilly at the top, and windy but if you're dressed for it... you'll have fun! We hiked a bit of the trails and threw snowballs. We had the waffles too! They were delicious!"
753,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Saint Paul, MN ","Expensive, but a must-do",You really can't come here without riding the tram. The views are amazing and it's fun to hike around at the top and play in the snow. Tram staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Don't forget warm gear for the top! Waffles are served up there too--big hit for my 6 year old.
754,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Gardner, KS ",Don't go if chance of storms,The other reviews are correct when they say it is worth the view. The infamous waffles are just OK. They make for a nice warm up since it was freezing up at the top. There was a chance of storms the day we went ... We ended up stuck at the top for over 3 hours. Turns out a view and waffles aren't that great when you're waiting out a storm for 3.5 hours.
755,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016,not available,"Madison, WI ",Views from on top are amazing,"I first need to say, if you are afraid of heights, this may not be the experience for you, but if you can hold off on your fears, the views from the top are spectacular. I think the most nerve racking part was the grating you walked on when you got off of the tram at the top. Once I was on solid ground on the top I was good. The views are just inspiring and you get to see the paragliders very near which is fun to watch (in the morning). The waffles are talked about as amazing at the top, but I was not really inspired by the waffles and preferred just standing and looking at the peaceful views."
756,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Great views .. not sure if it worth the money!,"The views are amazing no doubt .. you are on top of a mountain with amazing scenery. There were four of us that rode up the tram - 2 senior citizens, a 17 year old and myself. A prepaid regular admission is $32, seniors are $24 and children up to 17 are $ 17 .. so are grand total was about $100 for four people to ride the tram. Later in the season the pass gets more expensive BUT you get to do more things with the pass also .. like other chair lifts.etc so it may be more of a value then. The ride was enjoyable and the scenery was amazing though .. just have to see if it is worth it to you !"
757,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2015 , Family,Lockport ,Amazing views,The Jackson Hole Aerial tram is a can't miss attraction. The views are spectacular. Try to be early in line so you can get a seat in the front of the team. The kids were amazed that they could see snow. And be sure to have enough time to explore once you reach the top.
758,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2016 , Couples,"Scotland, UK ",Fantastic views,We went up the mountain in the tram early in the morning. There was still skiing at this time at the end of May. We had hot waffles and coffee at the top. Fantastic views from the top and getting up and down the mountain. The guide does each run and explains what's going on. A must do if in the area.
759,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016,not available,"Zion, IL ",Best View in Town,"Amazing views available at the top over 10,000 ft above sea level. A bit colder at the top than at the bottom bring a sweater or long sleeve shirt even if it is 90 degrees at the bottom. A little bit expensive but can't really beat the view."
760,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Knoxville, TN ",Breathtaking views!,"What a great ride to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. Early in the season (6/3/2016) made for a small passenger load and were free to move about the tram to explore all the views. Once at the top, the brisk and gusty air gave us a preview of what a hike in those elevations would be like and carrying a heavier jacket was a smart idea. I even carried gloves and a hat because after an hour of photography it was much needed.  While at the top, warming up with a nice warm drink and a waffle is a grand and tasty idea.  Tram operators are friendly and knowledgable about the area and welcomed everybody's questions."
761,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016,not available, ,Awesome view,"I would definitely recommend taking the tram to the top and enjoying the view. We wen on a very clear day and the views were amazing. It was quite windy, but still very nice. The altitude is 10,450 feet so you may feel it."
762,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Ontario, CA ",Beautiful View,"This is one of those tourist traps that you have to do if you are there. It offers gorgeous views, BUT it is not cheap, so beware."
763,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Prairie du Sac, WI ",View Jackson Hole from the Crow's Nest,"This is a very special and fun activity. It rivals Germany's Zug Spitze mountain top ride. From this vantage point you can see all of Jackson Hole, a valley surrounded by mountains on every side. Through the middle of it all you can see the Snake River winding through the valley. There are walks up at the top of the mountain ranging from easy (although it's over 10,000 feet altitude) to strenuous. You can even take the seven mile hike back to the bottom of the mountain. The ride is amazing, taking only 12 minutes to reach the summit. Bring binoculars and a camera with a good zoom to fully enjoy the sites."
764,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2016 , Friends,"Mesquite, NV ","Views from over 10,000 feet!","The tram is very large. we were on a bus trip that dropped us off in the ski village. The tram had tickets and we waited for about 15 minutes to get on. The operators were not very informative, but there were some knowledgeable employees around. The view was amazing. It was cold so bring a jacket. I had gloves and people made some fun, but in the end I was warm. The cabin at the top sold some food, but was crowded."
765,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples, ,Amazing views!,"A little expensive, but totally worth it for the amazing views at the top, which is at 10,450 feet. It's a nine minute ride to the top. You could see snowy mountains on one side and all the way across the green valley on the other. We spent at least an hour and a half walking around on the trails and taking photos of the views from different angles. The little restaurant at the top has delicious waffles and there was a marmot hanging out around the deck. It's about 10-15 degrees cooler at the top, but it was unseasonably warm and I was fine in short sleeves even though there was still snow a foot deep in some places. This was one of my favorite places in Jackson Hole."
766,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Knoxville, TN, ",Great ride great view,Tram goes from about 6000 feet up to about 10000 feet. The view is spectacular as you can see for miles across the whole valley. There is a snack type restaurant at the top. Get one of the local free papers and there should be a coupon for $5 off the price.
767,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016,not available,"Carmichael, CA ",Nice tourist thing to do,It's pricey but the views are spectacular! The price included the chair lift and gondola rides but they are not in service yet. Staff was pleasant. Ask for a discount and they will help with a $5 coupon.
768,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,Georgia ,Worth the $$ for the view!,"Don't be scared, my kittens: This tram is super-smooth. Like Tom Jones smooth. No bumps or weird movements that make you think ""OMG we're gonna fall!!"" There's a bit of a swing when passing the upper supports, but eh. It's all good.    The ride up is about 10 minutes and you clear 10K feet at the top. A few of us could feel the altitude and were a bit breathless - or maybe that was the view from the top ...    You can see everything: the valley, the Tetons, mountains near and far - it's beyond spectacular.    My wish for all of you is that you have the opportunity to ride with the total duuuude tram driver that we did. Homeboy was chillin' hard, yo.    We were there June 6 and there was still plenty of snow on the ground.    Be sure and check out the mountain on the way down: we saw several deer/elk things."
769,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Family,"Simsbury, CT ",Great activity in the summer and winter!,"There is no skiing comparable to Jackson Hole, and the Aerial Tram is the highest lift on the mountain. During the summer, the experience is just as incredible, with unbelievable views and a great hike down. It takes about three hours to hike down from the tram and it is not too difficult as long as you have good knees. My parents had trouble with their knees from the constant down hill walking. Also, once the snow is gone it is possible to hike up from the tram to Cody Peak, and then walk back down to the tram and take it down to the bottom. While riding up, make sure to see Corbet's Couloir and S&S. It is expensive to ride up, but if you're going more than once then definitely get a summer pass."
770,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Cranford, NJ ",Great Experience Fantastic Views,"Taking the tram up the mountain, is a fun experience in its self. When you reach the top the views are spectacular. We visited on a beautiful clear and unseasonably warm morning in June, but people were still headed down the mountain in skis. Make sure you walk around and enjoy the view from all angles. You will love it."
771,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,May 2016 , Couples,"Frisco, TX ",Beautiful View,Tram just reopened yeaterday. Today sunny and chilly at top. We walked around and enjoyed a Hot Chocolate. Lots of families. Friendly staff.

773,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Family, ,Spectacular View of the Grand Tetons,The Aerial Tram provides the visitor with spectacular and stunning views of the surrounding mountain ranges; the Grand Tetons being among them. The accessibility of the tram is easy and well worth the price!
774,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Jackson, WY ","MUST RIDE, GORGEOUS VIEWS!!","I live in Jackson, WY and once in a while I ride the tram just for fun, it is free for locals on certain days. I prefer summer ride when it is less crowded. In winter it is fully loaded with 100 skiers/snowboarders and it may feel claustrophobic for some. Plenty room to sit or stand in the summer/spring/fall , it takes about 10 minutes to the top and the ride is thrilling, it does rock with each passing tower. For those with fear of heights (including me) dont look down the last 2-3 minutes where it goes the highest-there is a huge drop by the end and it will take your breath away. On the top, you can walk around, enjoy overwhelming beautiful one of a kind views, get chocolate waffles or you can hike down (around 4 hours). It is cold up there even in the summer so bring jacket."
775,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2016 , Family,"Westfield, NJ ",Coolest ski life in America,"The tram is a great experience. It almost seems fraternal with all the people excited about the same thing...skiing great lines from the top of Rendezvous Mountain. The tram operators have their own unique personalities and musical tastes so you don't know what your going to get each time, but you know it will be good."
776,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2016 , Family,"Pensacola, FL ",Must See,This is one of those must do things in Jackson Hole. I had a chance to ride the tram last summer and again this winter. What awesome views. Well worth the time and cost.
777,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2016 , Family,"Portland, ME ",Don't miss this JH icon!,"As long as you are an expert skier, the tram is a ""must do"". Everyone stands for the entire ride and the tram operator plays great music on the way up. Try and get a space next to a window because the views are spectacular. The tram is full of very legitimate expert skiers. No fur hoods or designer one-piece outfits in sight and the more duct tape the better! Don't miss the waffles at Corbett's Cabin on the way down. There are no moderate trails off of the tram so be prepared. If you can get down an expert trail, this is the way to get to the top!"
778,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2016 , Family,"Vineyard Haven, MA ",worth the effort at least once,Plan on waiting in line at least 20 to 30 minutes before getting on. When riding up with the skiers you are packed in to the point it would not be possible to fall over as the tram swings when going over the towers. If you are not either among the first 20 people or last few on the tram you will probably not have a good view especially if you are short. If your going for the view in winter be sure to go on a bluebird day. The waffles at corbits cabin are good but I wouldn't go just for those. For skiers up to the challenge it is well worth the trip as long as the snow conditions are good.
779,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2016 , Family,"Tracy, CA ",Waffles!,We took the tram to the top to see the view and try the waffles. It was crowded in the car but cool at the top. Worth the trip.

Simply went up, had waffles and Irish coffee, ride down and enjoyed the winter look of the mountain. Since we got here on the 13th, it has been snowing so everyone is enjoying fresh powder!"
782,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2015 , Couples,Glendale ,"If the altitude doesn't take your breath away, the views will","While in Jackson for the Grand Tetons half marathon, had to check out the sights. We booked online to save a couple bucks/ticket. Ended up in the tram with a couple of paragliders and an older gentleman who worked there. I chatted with the employee all the way up who told me you can see a bear sometimes and for June, it was 50 degrees and warm for as much snow as was on the mountains. Watched the paragliders take off and float around. Great views of the valley & Snake River."
783,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Spokane, WA ","Top of the mountain, no easy runs down from this section of the mountain","Great experience. It is possible to ride the tram back down.

784,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Mar 2016 , Family,"Lakeville, MN ",An Experience all by itself!!,"Even if you don't ski or it is in the summer, this is a genuinely unique experience! You will have views like you have never seen before of the Tetons, Corbets Collier (one of the toughest chutes at Jackson, if not in the country) and all the surrounding Wyoming mountains and sky. You can even get waffles at the top! (Really good waffles, I might add!)"
785,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Couples, ,Worth a ride up even if you don't ski down,"We made two attempts at the tram during our trip - the first during a storm and the second on a gorgeous clear day. The wind was blowing 45 and visibility was down to 20 feet the first time, and since we hadn't done the run before, we decided to be safe and head down on the tram. We tried again two days later on an awesome day. It was mostly sunny and you could see for miles. It was still pretty windy since you are on the summit, but it was easily manageable. We skied down Rondezvous bowl, which was very steep but so wide you could pick and choose your way down even if you aren't that comfortable on blacks or bumps. From there you have the options of backcountry, blues, blacks, double blacks and semi-off piste terrain. All of it was fun and we tried to stay safe while still challenging ourselves. If you're not careful you can end up in some hairy spots, so make smart choices and have fun! If you've never successfully skied a black, do not make this your first. Try something lower on the mountain that is more accessible first - I recommend Casper Traverse. One of our friends didn't ski down but said it was still worth it to go up for the view. Enjoy!"
786,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Couples,"Los Angeles, CA, ",Tram Views .....,"The aerial Tram is the top way to see the expanse of the Jackson Hole area - short of a helicopter ride.

787,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Couples,"London, UK ",Jackson Hole -THE place to ski,"We have skied just about everywhere in Europe, and many of the great North American resorts, but nothing compares to Jackson. I love Val d'Isere, Val Thorens, Vail, Whistler, Snowbird, all of those places, but Jackson is special. Very challenging, but accessible. The Wyoming view is, if you can see it, ski it. None of this on/off piste thing. The mountain is yours. Choose your own way down. I love that.  And the packages available for tuition are exceptional. We did Steep and Deep Camp, four days of intensive tuition, including a half day of Out Of Bounds (guided off piste). I cannot recommend this enough. There are two day courses too, but I would recommend the four day. And they will cater for everyone, whatever level. I cannot even quite comprehend how much I got from the course.  And Jackson itself is so cool. Anything you want to eat, lots to do. Very welcoming.  Enjoy"
788,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016,not available,"Summerfield, FL ",OMG!!!,"This was so much fun! I wasn't crazy about the crowd going up, but coming down was only our family and one other person. It was surreal. A real high point of our visit to Jackson."
789,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Friends,Andalucia ,"Amazing views, great skiing from top of tram.","Even if you do not feel confident to go down Rendezvous bowl you should ride the tram just for the views from the top. Even if you are not an advanced skier you can traverse the bowl from side to side and get it done. From there you can come down the rest of the way on blue runs. If you are a beginner and decide to go down anyway, good luck and hope you are good at getting back up on vertical terrain."
790,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Couples,los angeles ,nice ride,Gets you to the top quick. Some tram operators are better than others. Always depends on who is DJIng! back left side has the best views.
791,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Couples,"Redditch, UK ",Waiting in line...,"If you want to access the top of the Rendezvous side of the ski area, this is your only option.    Even when quiet the wait for the tram is quite long and all that standing in line in ski boots and then on the tram itself meant we didn't use it that often. Moreover since you're crammed in like sardines and are lucky to get a view out.    You have to take the ride at least once however and the best bit for me was the tram announcer just before you reach the peak, ""...if you don't know, don't go!"""

I recommend asking the Jackson Hole staff for the condition of the snow before going up. Early afternoon typically offers the best snow.
793,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Business,Suwanee ,Awesome!,We rode the Tram to the top of the mountain. Was not as scary as I thought it might have been. 1/2 way up it started snowing.

Can get really packed, holds around 100 people and takes about 9 minutes to get to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. You can get food, such as waffles, from Corbet’s Cabin but a little expensive. Then either get the tram, board, ski or paraglide back down. A must do if in Jackson."

When we got on the tram we were warned that there was bad weather within 60 miles. By the time we got to the top we got in the middle of a huge storm. On top there is a rustic little food and drink stand. Drank some beers and waited out the storm at 15,000 feet! So much fun. This is worth the $35 ticket. First pick is when we got to mountain top. Storm hit 5 minutes later. Lighting was so close. What a fun time. You gotta do:)"
798,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2016 , Business,"Atco, NJ ",Ride the tram to the top,Took a break from skiing and rode the tram to the top of the mountain and had homemade waffles and hot coffee at the little restaurant! The ride down the mountain was even better because only a few of us rode back down. A must do!
799,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Couples,"Palo Alto, CA, ","The Tram opens the best skiing in America, but the views are awesome too","Most people take this 100 person aerial tram to access Rendezvous Bowl, which is truly a remarkable, steep, expert skiers bowl of remarkable proportion; however, even if you don't ski at an expert level, it is worthwhile to go up to see the 11,000 foot view of the Grand Teton and the rest of the teton range. It is truly awesome."
800,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Couples,"Seattle, WA ",get to the top,this modern tram holds 100 skiers at a time. They will tell you that the terrain is for experts only. It is not that steep but it is ungroomed. With a little bit of care an intermediate skier ocular do it. Worth the trip cause the view is great.
801,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Feb 2016 , Friends, ,You have to go up,I left my skis at the bottom I had no intention of even entertaining the idea of skiing down. The ride up is fun everyone is stoked on adrenaline the views are glorious and at the top you are treated to the best waffles in Wyoming. The ride down is even better because you have the whole car to yourself. I had a great conversation with the operator and almost saw someone do corbetts but they thought better of it.
802,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Waxahachie, TX ",A must!,"Even if you are not skiing, ride to the top for the beautiful views! And don't pass up the chance at a Corbet's Cabin waffle while you're there!"
803,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2015 , Friends,"Cozumel, Mexico ",Best way to Hike a Mt.,Started are hiking trip at the top of the mountain rather than the bottom and it was a way better way to do it. Super fun ride up and great hike through the Tetons.
804,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2016 , Family,"Buenos Aires, Argentina ",Breathtaking view and fast access to the summit,"A must for accessing the summit and bowls. We had zero wait, fun rock music and corteous host. Love the skiikg. Expert skiers only, no access to blue tracks."
805,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Pittsburgh, PA, ",Picturesque,Remember to take your camera &/or video camera because the views are amazing. Try to get a seat in the front of the car on the way up & back if you can. There is definitely a temperature drop at the top so be prepared. We are not skiers so we visited in September just before the snow started. On a clear day it seems like you can see forever. You can hike down if you want but we rode the tram both ways. You can stay at the top as long as you want as the trams run constantly during the day.
806,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Banner Elk, NC ",Awesome views,The ride is great and the waffles at the top are too! Go up even if you ride back down! There isn't a crowd on the way down so you get better pictures.
807,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2015 , Couples,"Reston, VA ",tram ride,"the tram is real cool, you have to stand up for the 10 minute ride but there is music and a great view. The tram can be ridden both ways so you dont need skis. Just a coat and some binoculars."

Take some photos, enjoy the view and then pick your route back..  RENDEZVOUS bowl to enter the Hobacks or drop into Wally World or Bivouac take you pick or choose the Laramie traverse for an easier way down. Some might choose Corbet's but I only want to view that from the safety of the bottom along Tensleep. Actually you can ride the tram back down but do not miss this epic ride, especially on the resorts 50th birthday."
809,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2016 , Family,"Raleigh, NC ",Wait for a better place in line to get best views!,"You just have to see it. Fantastic views. Even if you have to wait for the next tram…if you are going up to sight see, make sure you are one of the first people on the tram on a busy day. The idea is to get in first so you can claim a spot by any of the four corners! The corners going up the hill are best on the way up the hill, the corners going down the hill first are the best on the way down. Getting on first so you can really see - especially below the tram - is essential. However, if you get stuck on a crowded ride up the mountain because of skiers…most people who ride up - ski down…so you have a better chance of getting a great corner view spot on your way down, when it is not so crowded."
810,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Portland, OR ",Jackson Hole Aerial Tram,"Visited Jackson Hole back in September 2015 and one of my favorite things was the aerial tram. When you arrive at the top, you will not be disappointed. We were lucky as the sky was nice and clear but be sure to bring a jacket. It gets a little chilly up there."
811,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Catawissa, PA ",FROM UP ABOVE~ ITS a 10 +,We ARE NOT SKIERS...and we visited in SEPTEMBER. From the first minute you step foot into this tram...YOU WILL BE IN AWE. The sight of the mountains and the valleys below Is SPECTACULAR. It moves slow enough to be able to capture the photos that CAN ONLY BE TAKEN as aerial views. Then when you arrive at the TOP....HOLD on to YOUR HATS !!! Even though it's warm down below....NOT SO MUCH AT THE TOP !! Again the view is BREATHTAKING. Then there is the WAFFLES that they serve and THEY ARE a MUST even if your NOT prepared to BRAVE the COLD...they are SO PART OF THE EXPERIENCE !!! JUST BE PREPARED TO BE MYSTIFIED !!

Once we moved away from summit there were very few people .. The workers at the summit cafe were very friendly as well as the tram workers .. Take a jacket it was COLD up top even in July! .. Beautiful views .. Worth the time and money

817,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Melbourne, Australia ",Spectacular view.,What an amazing experience to go so high so fast! The views are spectacular from every angle. To ski down from here is quite an experience.

819,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jan 2016 , Friends,"Bluefield, VA ","If you go up, eat a waffle at the top!","My daughter and I didn't have lift tickets, so we had to pay $32 each for one ride to the top and back. We were on the first ride of the morning, so we were packed in with 100 skiers on the way up but had the tram to ourselves on the way back down. We ate waffles at the top which were fabulous. The views were spectacular. I wouldn't ride more than once due to the price, but it's worth one ride."
820,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2015,not available,"Indianapolis, IN ",Amazing View,My wife and I visited the Grand Teton/Yellowstone area for the first time in June 2015. Our first stop was Jackson Hole where we stayed the first 3 nights. The Aerial Tram was our first activity in the area. We weren't let down. We went right at the beginning of the day and didn't have to wait at all to take the ride to the top. Once up at the peak we hiked a little while and took in the amazing views of the entire area. It was one of our most memorable experiences of our entire trip and one I will never forget. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in the area.
821,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2015 , Family,"New York City, NY ",Aerial wonder,"The tram is a quick, efficient and music-filled way to the top of the mountain! I rode as a passenger, as I can't ski these days, and i enjoyed the bustling trip up and the quiet trip down. Views amazing, lift operator very nice, and although I found the pedestrian ticket much too expensive ($32 for a single round trip) I enjoyed myself a lot."
822,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2015,not available,"Chicago, IL ",DO THIS!,All the thrills of flying on a mountainside without the danger! Spectacular views of Jackson and the valley of Grand Teton. Excellent for taking pictures and there are lots of other things to do here if you're afraid of heights.
823,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2015 , Family,"Quakertown, PA ",Nice visit,"Took the tram ride to the top. On a clear day like we were lucky to experience you can see for miles. At the top we warmed up in the cabin, where they serve waffles and got chocolate. Very good, but very very small. Had to wait 15 minutes for a table to open up."
824,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Family,"Cedar City, UT ",I love Teton Village!,I have been here several times and rode the tram once. Fabulous views and friendly people! I could live there all summer.
825,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2015 , Family,"Seward, NE ",Fun activity,"During our Dec 2015 visit, we took the tram to the top of the summit (10,000 feet). This tram held 100 people & they really packed us in going up. The tram ride lasted 9 minutes each way. There is one tram going up & one tram coming down. At the top, the temperature dropped and the wind picked up quite a bit causing somewhat of a whiteout effect. We ate the delicious waffles at Corbet's Cabin. Lots of variety of waffles to choose from. Would highly recommend this even if you aren't skiing."
826,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Wellfleet, MA, ",Great experience,"My wife, my mother and I took the tram while visiting Jackson in the summertime. We really enjoyed the views and once we got to the top were able to hike around and adjust to the altitude.    At the top we were also treated to a bunch of hang gliders enjoying themselves in the updrafts.    It was very enjoyable and it look like everyone in the area was having fun."
827,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Family,"Mumbai, India ",You can't miss it,We were lucky to get on the usually $37 gondola ride for free due to some ongoing festival in Teton village. Gives a breathtaking view of the valley. Highly recommended
828,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Dec 2015 , Couples,"Lakewood, CO ",Gotta get up there!,"Take the tram! Sure it's all blacks but even if your not skiing/snowboarding down go for the ride, views and Corbetts Cabin(waffles!). It's 10,450 feet to the top and only one way to get there."
829,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available, ,Ultimate viewing opporturnity,Finally got to ride the tram! Gorgeous views of the Tetons and surrounding area. Just be mindful of the dates the tram is operating.
830,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2015 , Family,"Jackson, WY, ",Beautiful!,"Ours was a special visit generously arranged for Boy Scout troop 67 to spend the night in Corbett's Cabin on top! It was my third non-skiing trip of the year but was more memorable because it had already closed for the season. Yet the cabin on top, ringed by classic skis and boards of some of the hill's great names, is tended each sleep cycle by the ""night creature"" who, as a former Boy Scout, sang the vespers from Philmont Ranch from memory. We were offered some of the days specialty waffles, too! I do miss the old Austrian style clock tower and the entire list old world theme is yesterday's Teton Village. But the new tram is a joy and a wonder. And I am personally grateful for some old fashioned, politically incorrect sentiment on the top of Rendezvous Mountain. Our modern world is leaving too much historic vitality behind."
831,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2015 , Family, ,"Great views, wow on the price","Rode the Tram while visiting Jackson Hole so my son could see what his grandfather had built (the first one in the sixties). Great views, nice staff. But way overpriced even for Jackson. 54.00 for 8 minute ride!"
832,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Northamptonshire, UK ",Enjoyable Fun Experience,"The Ariel Tram travels a distance of 2.4 miles in 9 minutes from its Teton Village base to the summit of Rendezvous Mountain at 3185m and provides visitors with fantastic views of the surrounding area of Jackson Hole. Passengers may sit or stand in the Tram to enjoy the vertical rise of 1261m with amusing cheers after every pylon as the cabin drops down on the cable. At the top, walk around to enjoy the incredible views at 10,450ft or visit the refreshments cabin before catching the next tram down. A most enjoyable fun experience."
833,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available,"Essex, UK ",Spotted a brown bear,A little expensive but decided had to do it as probably won't visit this area again. We were lucky to spot a brown bear on the way up ( only one I saw in two weeks in Yellowstone & Teton !). Great views from the top - did a couple of very short walks to spot marking deaths of two rangers. Chocolate and waffles at the café before returning down. Went mid morning so tram was full with limited seating . If you want to sit you may need to go at a quieter time.
834,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Traralgon, Australia ",Fun ride and great views,As well as this ride we got some other rides for the same ticket. There are fantastic views on the way up and down and from the top the sights are spectacular. We had the extra excitement of an electrical strom come in as we arrived at the top. This meant no trams until it had passed but what a show for us.
835,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2015,not available, ,That View!,"The view is spectacular. You can ride the tram to the top for free. If you plan to eat, get there early. Also, don't forget to bring a sweater, it gets chilly up there, even in the summer."
836,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2015 , Family,Boise ,Awesome views,"Fun ride up to the top of the 10,450 foot peak! It's a bit pricey, but the views are incredible! Be sure to watch for moose, bear and deer as they are abundant here."
837,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Family,"Preston, ID ",Waffles!,"Expensive tram ride to the top; but, the waffles at The Waffle House at the top are to die for! It's become a family traditions that my kids won't miss."
838,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Island of Hawaii, HI ",Fun but a bit pricey.,"We did enjoy the ride and the guides are very knowledgeable. The only problem is that when you get tot he top, watch out! It is freezing up there! No wonder so many get their famous waffles. My husband had one and loved it but was concerned the whole time of the trip back to the gondola for the ride down. The gondola however is very comfortable."
839,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,Wisconsin ,Road Caution!!!!!!!!!!,"While out in Jackson we wanted to do the aerial tram and took the road from inside the Tetons National Park. HUGE mistake. This road is pretty much impassable in a car (we have a full size vehicle). An SUV and truck is HORRIBLE but passable. After bottoming out the car, we turned around and never made it there since we didn't have time. Take the freeway road to this attraction. (we didn't know about the freeway road) We did hear great things from others about their experience. You can take the tram up and then hike back down."
840,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2015 , Couples,"Buffalo, NY ",What a ride!,"We were fortunate enough to ride the Tram the last day before it shutdown till ski season. It was amazing even though it was cloudy at the top. 10,453 feet and 37 degrees on the 4th of October! We warned up to Hot chocolate in the small restaurant at the top. It hit the spot! They serve waffles which looked wonderful but we didn't sample them. This ride on a clear day would be even better but we still had amazing views!"
841,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Nov 2014,not available,"Springfield, OR ",A summer's day must,"This tram is easy to access, slow going up the mountain so you can take a lot of photos and once at the top there are several ways to descend the mountain - the tram back down, the slide or hiking if you can. Hiking is a wonderful experience for the views, the wildflowers and fresh mountain air you can never get enough of."
842,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2015,not available,"Seward, NE ",Excellent views!,"If you're in the Teton Village area, check on the Aerial Tram. The views you get from the tram going up and down are amazing, as well as the top of the mountain itself. The diner at the top of the mountain serves waffles and various drinks - check them out too!"
843,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Friends,"Cave Creek, AZ ",Stunning Views,"Although it is rather expensive, highly recommend this trip....the tram operator was very helpful.

844,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Atlanta, Georgia ",Awesome views,Tram ride was smooth except for a couple swings that the operator prepares you for. Wonderful view of the Tetons and yummy waffles at the mountain restaurant.
845,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Bloomington, MN ",Amazing trip up to the top!,"Don't miss this if you are in the area. The view at the top is wonderful, and half of the fun is the ride up and down."
846,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Schenectady, NY ",Fun ride!,The ride was fun. The views ascending & descending are just beautiful. Even more spectacular are views from the top! Definitely worth it. The operators were friendly & pointed out additional things beyond the recording that played. Our operator spotted 2 moose on the way up - a real treat! It's chilly at the top so remember to bring a jacket even if it's warm at the bottom!
847,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Fox River Valley, Wisconsin ",Top of the World,"We wandered to Teton Village with no idea of what goes on there. We joined a line of people getting tickets to this tram ride. People boarding were dressed in everything from shorts, tee shirts and sandals, to winter coats, hats and gloves and carrying walking sticks. It was a pleasant ride up the mountain, with spectacular views and good commentary. At the top of Rendezvous Mtn there was wind of about 25 mph, sustained, and it was perhaps 40°F with an unknown, but raw, wind chill factor.  You may stay past the scheduled return trip to the village and get a later ride down, except for at the end of the day. We made snowballs up there, and visited the Cabin more for warmth than anything, treating ourselves to hot chocolate. Rest rooms contain pit toilets and a bottle of hand sanitizer.  The air is thin up there, at 10,450 feet, and we stayed the minimum time. On the ride down our ""conductor"" was very informative and answered questions for the passengers.  If in doubt as to what to wear, take a warm coat or a lined windbreaker - gloves wouldn't hurt, either. Most important, take a lot of pictures so that you can take the beautiful scenery home with you!"
848,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available,"Brooklyn Park, MN ",Great Views!,"We took our two-year-old son on the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. The views were great, the ride was smooth, and the person running the tram was very friendly. The top of the mountain is great also, because you can stop at Corbet's Cabin for waffles and coffee. Tons of fun!"
849,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Family,"Sugar Grove, IL ",Great views!,We really enjoyed the trip up to the mountain but be prepared it is a little chillier up there and remember if you miss the last Tram out then you are stuck on the top of the mountain- no joke.
850,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2015 , Family,Vernal ,Better bring your own food,"The trip with the gondola is fine. Eventually you can even see moose down on the skislopes in summer.  The refreshments up in the cabin are a rip off, though. Really bad and expensive. Hot chocolate from a machine, and the waffles are made on those hotel breakfast buffet tables.  Maybe the cook had a bad day...but they tasted really cheap  $10 per person for Chock/Waffle combo is not even justifiable for getting the ingredience up there.  /"
851,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Alamo, CA ",First ride up was a great idea,"Joined the hang gliders and took the fun trip up. Phenomenal piece of engineering. Attached to 40 foot in rock steel and concrete pillars. Did a short hike around the top. Almost did tandem hang glide down for $245, then chickened out. Went for the waffles in Corbets cabin at 10,500 feet instead! Wonderful views of valley and Grand Teton. Fun!"
852,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available,"Saint Louis, MO ",Fantastic ride and view,"A bit pricey but the view from the top is unreal. Must be seen and felt! Such fresh, cold mountain air.  On,y negative was that upon coming down, we overheard the staff say to load the car otherwise they'd have to stay later after closing. And once the tram arrived at the bottom, the doors opened without any notice and several spilled out the doors. Great ride folks, but remember SAFETY!"
853,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2015 , Family,"Charlotte, NC ",Lots of fun,Take water and layer your clothing! Well  Worth the trip and the price. Hot chocolate and waffles at the top were fun but nothing special.
854,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Family,Western Michigan ,Worth the view!,"We were amazed from the view at 10,450 feet! The ride itself is very smooth and comfortable. We could take or leave the waffle house at the top, but the views are stunning! We did the free rides to 9,000 ft. the day before and enjoyed our time there but the height and thin air up at the top of the tram ride has to be experienced."
855,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Kennewick, WA ","View, view view!",This was a beautiful ride up the hill and not any more expensive than trams at other places. We couldn't have had a better day for it no wind and the weather was beautiful. I went on a tandem parasailing ride. What an experience!
856,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Family,"Mittagong, Australia ",Ripoff,"$37US for a trip to the top of a mountain and back down with pre-recorded information playing really is too much. The trip lasts about 5 minutes each way. Frankly the Grand Tetons are amazingly beautiful from the ground, going up on of the mountains & looking over the plans is alright but not for the cost."
857,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Lake Wylie, SC ",Breath taking view,A different approach to looking at the Grand Tetons. A fun 10-12 minutes in the air. Excellent Belgian waffles and hot cider on top.
858,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,United States ,Absolutely Spectacular,"We took Jackson hole Aerial Tram in the morning on a nice sunny September day. The ride up and then back down, both were amazing. The mountains, pine trees, aspen trees changing colors for the fall... views were amazing from the tram and also from the top. We took some pictures. It was 55 degrees on top, so you might want to bring a warm jacket. People operating the tram all were very nice and helpful."
859,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Wrexham, UK ",A ride not to be missed,"Well worth the money,especially with Seniors discount.We went up in good weather ,but the hot chocolate in the cafe was very welcome.Photo opportunities are numerous and you can see wildlife on the way up or down.Tram driver was quite witty and pointed out things of interest as well as ensuring the safety of passengers."
860,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples, ,A vista-filled ride to spectacular hiking,"We wanted to do some hiking in the upper elevations and the tram going up and down was not just a ride. Our tram operators up and down were both knowledgeable and well-spoken. You see the greater Jackson area as you approach the summit. The tram travels over the mountain bike course and our operator was able to spot a moose below for us. If you're so inclined, your tram ticket also gets you a ride up and down on a chair lift. This is worth the trip, especially if you want to hike around the upper elevations of Rendezvous Mountain. See the photo for our view from the Cody Bowl area."
861,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Hingham, MA ",WOW!!,"We took the tram up to the summit on a Sunday AM (in lieu of church!) It was an incredible experience of seeing God's earth, the snow capped mountains, and the entire Jackson Hole area. The wind at the top was something! We are so glad that we opted to do this! The tram itself is fast and runs every 15 minutes. A cozy lodge at the top offers hot chocolate, etc to warm the innards. Great day great view!!"

863,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Rock Hill, SC ",Prepare Yourself,"Conditions can change rapidly!!! My friends and I used the tram the second week of Sept to reach the Teton Crest Trail at the top of the mountain. The tram was $32 with a $5 coupon we had. I'm sure those wouldn't be hard to find around Jackson. Temperatures at Jackson Hole were around 45 degrees. As we started up the weather changes dramatically as we passed thru heavy fog, rain mixed with snow, then just snow. Temps at the top were 32 degrees and blowing snow. Our group was prepared as we were about to step off on the trail and expected worse conditions. There's a nice small cafe at the top with delicious smelling waffles and assorted beverages. If you're looking for the trail as we did, come out from the cabin steps and go straight down the hill past the Top of the World overlook. Enjoy"
864,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Clayton, North Carolina ",Incredible views,This is a must do while in Jackson / Jackson Hole. Views were amazing and they make waffles up at the top. We didn't have any but they smelled Dee-lish!

866,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples, ,A Wonderful Ride!,My wife and I were in Teton Village in mid-September and took the tram ride to the top of the mountain in the afternoon. All staff workers were very helpful and the guides in the tram pointed out various areas to look at on both the up and downward leg. We were able to see a mother bear with her two cubs which was “the icing on the cake” for us. The views were incredible on the ride as well at the top of the mountain. Waffles at the top were delicious too. Definitely worthwhile and something to consider experiencing if you are in the area!
867,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Solo, ,Money rippers!!!,"You go up and see nice views but not wow or amazing and all that for ""ONLY"" 37$...  Does it worth it??  Dont think so...    Endulge yourself with a great meal in Jackson Hole."

870,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Austin, TX ",Amazing trip,The weather was clear and windy the day we took the tram. We all enjoyed the great views and the time to explore at the top. I would do this again!
871,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Greenwood, IN ",Look forward to a beautiful view!!,"Was able to take the time to ride the tram up the mountain. It is definitely worth the time and money, especially this time of year when it is not crowded. You are able to take time to do some exploring and get some wonderful pics of the mountains and the valley!!"
872,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available, ,Spectacular Aerial Tram,"Oh My God, this was the best Aerial Tram I have ever been on! Scary because of the height, but what a spectacular view at the top. Definitely a must-do ride when you're in Jackson Hole!"
873,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Seattle, WA ",Awesome view of the Grand Tetons and Teton Village,"The tram goes up to 10,450 feet, which is about a 4,000 foot gain. The views are fantastic! We did a six mile hike which was tough but good, and finished with a beer at the top. Great exercise for summer visitors!"
874,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples, ,Flying high,"This was a blast! Informative and fun, and we were able to stop and watch moose in the hills. You can stay as long as you want at the top. Loved it."
875,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Centerville, OH ",A must while in Jackson Hole!,"My first visit to Jackson Hole with a large group of old college buds. Most had visited JH before and all suggested a trip to the Aerial Tram on my rookie trip as a must do! Were they ever right, this is a must do on a trip to JH! The views are spectacular both on the top and during the right up and the descent. It was fun watching the hang gliders prep their chutes and then launch off the top. You can stay at the top as long as you like with trams depart every 15 minutes. Don't miss this attraction!"
876,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples, ,Ariel Tram at Jackson Hole,"Our Mad River Boat Trips guide told us about the aerial tram in Teton Village. It was worth the trip (11 minutes to the top) for some awesome views of Wyoming at elevation 10, 410 feet.    A must do when in Jackson Wyoming."
877,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Family,"Franklin, TN ",Top of the Rockies is windy and cold!,"Took the Aerial Tram ride in August. Interesting but not earth shaking after spending 6 days in Yellowstone National Park. Maybe I was spoiled by Yellowstone and Grand Tetons. TripAdvisor comments warned us to wear jackets/warm gear. Totally wise advice. Windy and cold in August on the summit. Tourists in shorts and t-shirts quickly waited for next Tram ride down to Ski Resort. Views from top of ski mountain are good, but not the same as Grand Tetons."
878,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2015 , Friends,"Auckland, New Zealand ",Gorgeous Views,It was well worthwhile to go up into the snow on a sunny summer day. Lovely views and informative staff.
879,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Athens, AL ",AMAZING!! Worth Wvery Penny!!,Be sure to request Military Discount OR Senior Discount if eligible. The view was amazing. When we arrived at the top of the mountain it was SO WINDY we thought we would be blown off. Take a good jacket and head cover. Opportunity for fabulous pics of scenery AND pics of you and loved ones with awesome backdrop. On the ride down I sat facing the mountain and turned my camera video on. Actually captured two rock climbers on camera. They were so high it was amazing. Everyone loved seeing that video. Please go and enjoy. In addition they give you free Chair Lift rides to enjoy after the Tram ride. We rode chair lift twice as it was not a busy day. Lot of fun and I normally do not like heights.
880,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Family, ,WAFFLES AT 10000 FEET,The tram ride is a bit pricey but the view at the top makes up for that. There are plenty of places to get a $5 off coupon. There is a small restaurant at the top that serves several different kinds of waffles. We chose a brown sugar butter one and also had hot chocolate - in August. It is chilly up there!
881,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Niceville, FL ",See It All,"As you would expect, a GREAT view. A bit pricey but the view was worth every penny. The tram ""pilots"" did a very good job of giving a mini tour while on the tram. Great job of answering our group's many questions."
882,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Trussville, AL ",Spectacular Day,"This particular day we had cobalt blue skies and cool temps. It was the perfect day to take the Tram up to the top of Rendezvous. The view seemed limitless. We hiked several of the trails up top, including a short trek to Corbet's !! It takes a special idiot to ski that little gem!!! Not for me!!! I'll stay down on the ""easier"" tough slopes, thank you!!    Great experience."
883,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,Rowley ,"Trip to the top, not to be missed","We arrived in Jackson Hole around noon and boarded the green line bus to the tram, $6 each round trip, bus runs about every hour  Using a $5 off coupon, and they are in all of the local brochures, and our senior discount, the tram cost $24 each.  The ride is smooth and the view of the Tetons and the valley below was spectacular  The temperature at the top was 55 degrees with a 5 mph wind, but it did not feel cold  Make time for this trip, it is worth it"
884,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples, ,Awesome!,We rode the tram to the peak on a rainy day and were delighted and surprised to find a blustery blizzard welcome us upon our arrival at the top! It was beautiful!! Additionally the tram operators are friendly and eager to impart information . It was a really fun and worthwhile experience!
885,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Karlskrona, Sweden ",Serves a purpose,We used the tram to take us up the 4000'+ up the mountain to begin the Teton Crest Trail. We didn't realize how incredibly expensive it has become until we were standing there to buy a ticket. At $37/person we had to justify it at just less then $10 for every 1000' of elevation gain we did not have to lug our backpacks up the mountain. In that context it seemed ok.
886,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Fountain Hills, Arizona, United States ",360 Degree View At The Top - and Worth It,"This is just an awesome tram ride to the top of the mountain where you can see 360 degrees when you get there. The ride up and down is smooth, the car in great condition, and the drivers knowledgeable and friendly. The views are incredible on the way up as well as at the top. Definitely worth the time and cost if you are in the area and even remotely thinking about it."
887,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available,"Lawrence, KS ",Fun day,Got the early one of the first tram rides up spent about a half a day looking around cold and windy but wonderful blue waffles on top of a rendezvous mountain was wonderful accent surprise would do it again
888,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Dacula, GA ",Stunning views,Recommend this excursion to anyone who visits the Tetons area. Wonderful views at the top. Can hike around once on top if desired. We considered the pricing a value.
889,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jul 2015 , Family,Gainesville ,Good to do,"It was just a ride up mountain with great views but when we went a lot of things to do at that location were closed. I'd say it's worth it for the views but there are good views all around also,"
890,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Valparaiso, Indiana ",A breathtaking ride,"The tram ride was not on our original plans but are we glad we took it. It is pricey but well worth it. The views are tremendous and even my husband who is squeamish when it comes to heights enjoyed the ride up to the ""top of the world"". The ride was gentle and the views tremendous."
891,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,Houston ,Way out west,It was a fun ride to the top. The views were beautiful. You could walk around if you wanted. Our operator going up was very informative.
892,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available,"Lake Norman, NC ",tr am ride jackson hole,Loved the tram ride although the it's expensive.....for the view it's great as long as you are not afraid of heights...
893,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",This ride is pricey but well worth taking,"We loved the tram ride, what a beautiful sight from the top. Everyone involved with the tram made the experience enjoyable as well as informative. The day we took the ride was beautiful, a little hazy from at the top due to fires west, but that could not be avoided at this time. We did have to check out the waffle house at the top, waffles at 10,000 feet, yum. We didn't try them this time up but they smelled yummy and the prices were fair, next time. We loved the fact the tram ran every fifteen minutes or we could stay as long as we wished and walk the trails, take pictures, or just enjoy the view."
894,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Family,"Eagle, ID ",Geological Perspective,"We were fortunate to have ""operators"" that informed of the geological history of what we were seeing and tied it in with the Yellowstone Basin. Extremely interesting perspective, as we were also there to see Yellowstone Park.    Remember skiing this mountain at age 17, not sure with the Black Diamond & Double Black Diamond rating, I'd be up for it anymore. Certainly would not consider the the Chute, with a grade near ""crazy""!    Beautiful views of the Jackson Hole Valley, peaceful with a sleeping Giant just to the north, called a Super Volcano. Something extremely beautiful, yet tragic knowing the inevitable return of this active caldron with 1000 times the power of the most recent Mt. St. Helens eruption...."
895,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Jun 2015 , Family,"Corpus Christi, TX ",What a view,The ride up is incredible and the view i can not describe you have to see in person and the ride down is the best.
896,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Warren, OH ",Aerial ride,"We went up early in the morning. Great ride, very smooth to the top. Observation tower at very top,with gift shop and cafe that makes waffles. Saw quite a few para gliders. Beautiful day not a cloud in the sky"
897,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Family,"Highlands Ranch, CO ",Great view...even on a not-so-pretty day!,"It had been a few years since we'd taken the tram and really enjoyed going again. The view is great and without climbing, one that you can't get any other way. Check out the waffles...we would have if we hadn't already eaten. Check out the local paper for a $5 coupon discount. Totally recommend....though a bit pricey!"
898,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Family,"Long Island City, NY ",Nice trip,It's a ride up with a nice view...that's pretty much it. Good for pics. Easy trip. Family had a good time
899,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Baltimore, MD ",Nice views,This is a nice activity to get a great view of the area and see what the skiing must be like in winter. Best on a clear day. $29 per adult
900,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Mason, OH ",Best way to get to Rendezvous Mtn.!,"Each tram holds a lot of people so the line moves quickly and the ""driver"" is informative about the terrain, wildlife, etc. Very smooth ride with just a little bump & sway over the support towers."
901,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available,"Boise, ID ",Worth the View of the Tetons,"This was a great experience. The tram goes up to an elevation of 10,500 up the mountain. You gain elevation from the bottom to the top of 4,500 feet up. The view is breathtaking. Be prepared and take a jacket because it is much colder at the top. There is a waffle place at the top where you can get some food or a beverage. It only takes 12 minutes to get to the top. I am afraid of heights but was glad I did it."
902,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Family,"Plainview, NY ",Awesome Views,"Great Views, eat at either The Handle Bar Restaurant OR the Waffle House at the top of the mountain!!"
903,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Grass Valley, CA ",Gondola Ride to View the Whole of Jackson Hole,"Don't miss taking the free gondola up to the top of the mountain above Teton Village. At the top is a delicious array of options for lunch, appetizer, or dinner. The view is spectacular making it hard to get back on the gondola to return to Earth."
904,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015 , Couples,"South Burlington, VT ",Panoramic views of the whole valley,"We did this trip in mid September, as it starts to get cold, but it had warmed up by the time we made it to the summit. The views are outstanding. You can go for small or long walks, even all the way back down if you want. There was also the added attraction of watching the paragliders take off. Remember it's 10000 ft high."
905,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Friends,"Maplewood, MN ",Stellar View /Smooth Ride,"High buck, but probably worth it. There is a free ski lift you can take to a lower destination but we went for the gusto and weren't disappointed. Very smooth ride. I occasionally have motion sickness but the tram is so smooth and predictable it was not an issue. Stellar view."
906,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Singapore, Singapore ",Tram Ride just outside Jackson Hole.,"This is a tram ride that takes you up to over 10,000feet and gives you a glorious view of the surrounding country side and mountains."
907,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Oct 2014 , Couples,"Cathedral City, CA ",Spectacular Views of the Valley,"If you're visiting Teton Village for the first time, then a tram trip is a MUST. This is a view that can not be missed. Take a jacket because it's often VERY windy at the top of the mountain. If you go up early, you can hike down the mountain. The ride to the top is gorgeous. GO...you won't be sorry you made the trip."
908,Jackson-Hole-Aerial-Tram,Sep 2015,not available,Virginia ,Fun ride nice views GREAT waffles,We enjoyed our ride up and down on the tram. Once at the top the waffles are WONDERFUL!! They are worth the trip in themselves. There isn't much to do at the top but look around and come back down but it was still fun.
