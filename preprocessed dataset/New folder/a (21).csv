0,Yellowstone_National_Park,Apr 2022 , Family,"Houston, TX ",Great place to visit!,This place was amazing even if we didn’t see it all! We are going back for sure. There is a lot of driving so make sure to have plenty of gas. There is a gas station by Old Faithful so don’t worry. There is so much stuff to do so try to stay close to the park and follow the signs. It does get super crowded in the summer months so plan accordingly. Parking was horrible and lines were long in the more popular attractions. Make sure you have time in the park because there is so much beauty that you can miss something.
1,Yellowstone_National_Park,Dec 2021,not available,Minnesota ,Taking Children to Yellowstone in Winter,"My husband, daughter, son-in-law and my 7 and 11 year old grandchildren joined me to spend a magical Christmas in Yellowstone. This winter destination is not for everyone. It can be extremely cold, windy and snowy. Planning isn't easy and making sure children will enjoy the experience is paramount; I'm hoping this review will be helpful to others. Reservations open in mid March for the following winter so plan early. When you get lodging, sign up for the snowcoach transfers and make dinner reservations for all nights to avoid standing in long lines or eating far too late!    Everyone needs extra warm clothes to enjoy this trip. Think layers including a down sweater under a ski coat with hood to go over hat, neck gaitor, balaklava, snow pants, very warm boots and mittens. If you are older or cautious about ice, bring something like YakTrax for your boots. The kids also need functional clothing for extreme weather to keep them safe as well as able and excited to go outside. There is not much to do inside. It is well worth searching for warm children's boots and mittens and bringing mitten liners too. Many people take a snowcoach tour each day but the coaches are not fully heated and the guide makes frequent stops to get out and see the sights so warm clothes are also needed on tours. Our children are very good skiers (up and down as they say) so we chose to ski and or snowshoe each day to see the sights.    We flew into Bozeman and rented a car after deciding that an available shuttle to and from Mammoth wasn't worth the scheduling hassles. If it hadn't been Christmas Day, we would have stopped at a grocery store in Gardiner for breakfast items and snacks to avoid 3 restaurant meals. Mammoth's general store did have enough for us to get by. We spent 3 nights at Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, renting a room and a cabin with a hot tub which we all enjoyed each evening. The car was parked in this area for the entire week. The rental shop can get everyone outfitted and give information on trails. We didn't feel the need to use the ski shuttles.    The Snowcoach takes 4 hours each way between the 2 lodges. There are stops along the way for scenicstops and a restroom break. Dress warmly and consider motion sickness medication as it can be very bumpy.    We stayed at the Snow Lodge for 5 nights as there is much more to see there."
2,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available,Oklahoma ,God's beauty is stunning!,"All 16 of us were in awe of the beauty! Because there were so many of us, we decided to rent our own bus. If you can afford this, I highly recommend it. We had a guide for the entire day. He took us to every possible attraction. We stopped at Old Faithful, the gift shop, and any other side stops we wanted. On our way back to our cabins in Jackson, we stopped off and had our own private bbq at a park. It was an amazing day!!! We spent the entire day and could have gone longer."
3,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available,Oklahoma ,Yellowstone & Grand Teton National Parks 2021,"My trip was from August 28th to September 5th 2021. I am not allowed to link my video on YouTube as it is being considered as promotional. However, if you can find it, it is very informational. My channel is Moose Anderson and the video is titled Yellowstone & Grand Teton National Parks 2021 4K. It has a picture of Old Faithful Inn and is almost 3 hours long. It’s a documentary set to relaxing music. I searched for pictures of the 2 types of rooms I stayed in on Tripadvisor but could not find any. I think the video of the two rooms that I took, as well as the attractions we visited are very informative. I receive no monetary gain from this video as it uses copyrighted material from others. It is a vacation/informational type video to help others plan their vacation.    Accommodations:  Old Faithful Inn Old House Room with Private bath (video link removed)  Signal Mountain Lodge Upper Lakeside Retreat (video link removed)    I recommend a minimum of 5 days at Yellowstone and 2 days at Grand Tetons as you will see in my video. It is quite long as this is no simple State Park. It is America's original National Park and for good reason.    We stayed in an Old House Room with private bath at Old Faithful Inn and it was perfect. I saw no need to break up my stay and book another lodge like Canyon. It was centrally located for everything in Yellowstone except Mammoth but most attractions are on the Lower Loop. It saved me time not having to drive from outside the park as well as time not have to pack, check out, relocate, check in, unpack, etc. It was iconic Yellowstone. Historical, and a round the clock view of Old Faithful Geyser and the Upper Geyser Basin. The video will give you and idea of how to break up each day and each day took us about 11 hours, plus showers, dinners, and prepping for the next days. They were very long days and the hiking wore us out as there is some elevation change. Mild, but at higher altitude than we are accustomed to. I am 61, overweight, and out of shape, but the hikes were doable (many hikes shown in video link that was removed).    There were no mice as in other reviews. I am not sure if this was due to the Inn being closed all of last year, or our room being on the top floor, or perhaps they just finally got the problem under control? No mice. As far as food being limited due to COVID, it was fine. Dinner was a buffet but good selection. Meat Loaf, Huckleberry Chicken, Smoke sausage, Corn, Mashed Potatoes with Brown Gravy (good on the meat loaf), & Apple Crisp desert (as seen in video link that was removed). Breakfast was grab and go breakfast sandwiches, muffins, etc from Old Faithful Inn, or standard grab and go from Snow Lodge like bacon or sausage with scrambled eggs, biscuits & gravy, etc. Lunch can be found like $9.50 chili dog or hamburger in Mammoth. We even got a couple of sandwiches and threw in the cooler for later. The portions were great and quality was excellent. Trust me, I have a huge appetite and everything hit the spot. No shortages as some have reported.    Rooms were clean and the bed and pillows were perfect, unless I just dropped dead each night from the hiking. I had zero complaints. It was all perfect. Verizon had excellent coverage here and I could get internet service from my phone as a hotspot. My Mother is on Hospice and connectivity was important to me in case of an emergency.    Signal Mountain Lodge Lakeside Retreat provided stunning views of the Tetons for both sunrise & Sunset. The beds & pillows here were also perfect. We ate next door at Trapper Grill located withing the Lodge. The menu was limited as well but with all the selections, I don't see how. Maybe they have relaxed and are serving full menus, but the food was extremely good and plentiful. No Verizon Cell coverage here but I could do wifi calling and internet.    This trip was perfect. I had an extra day allowed for each National Park but they were not needed as the weather was perfect. There are no do overs when you live over 1000 miles away so if you can, plan these extra days in case you get rained out, or smoked out from wildfires.    The video (link removed) shows all attractions we were able to see, things to do, places we stayed, but again, it is long. Just watch some each evening until you are done. I have tried to include interesting facts, and I will be glad to answer any questions.    Yellowstone & Grand Tetons are a must see. Even more grand than the Grand Canyon & Sedona area, my second favorite National Park."
4,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021,not available,"Cary, NC ",A piece of heaven on Earth,"I'm surprised there are only 1.5K reviews for this amazingly beautiful park. This is heaven on Earth!! There is lakes, rivers, waterfalls, mountains, snow, canyon, wildlife geysers, hot springs, and what not.. When i had planned this trip i only had hot springs, geysers in my mind. I was soo wrong.. It has soo many rivers, scenic spots, numerous waterfalls, numerous lakes, mountains, wild life and rangers who sincerely care for wildlife. Was it not so far and expensive for me, i would visit this in every season. We visited this park for 6 days , still have so many things to be seen.. I envy people who live in West! For families with young kids, a word of caution, this is not the place to visit, if you are not willing to walk . You need to walk quite a bit to see most of things, also there are pit toilets, so prepare your children ahead of time. It won't be an easy trip for families with young children."

6,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021,not available,"Argyle, TX, ",Stunning National Park,"Yellowstone isn't just a national park, it's a national treasure. Plan on spending at least 3 days to explore. Besides Old Faithful, be sure to see Lower, Midway, Upper and Norris Geyser Basins. Mammoth Hot Springs has incredible formations. Madison River and Yellowstone Lake are scenic and serene. Hikes will take you to some beautiful waterfalls. You're sure to see some wildlife, too. We stayed outside the park so I can't comment on lodging. Get there as early as possible to avoid entrance lines. September was a good time to go, but it was still quite crowded."
7,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2021,not available,"Reno, NV ",Wasted Trip,The Park was closed for two days because of a snow storm.  All travel within Yellowstone was restricted.    The last day of our visit the snow stopped and we were allowed in the Park. Unfortunate for us we had no time to visit any of the attractions or sites and only drove through from the North entrance to the West entrance on our way home.    The few Park employees we did meet on our visit were rude and very disagreeable.  I have had many wonderful previous experiences in Yellowstone so I will not allow this terrible time deter me from visiting again.
8,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021,not available,"Caledonia, MI ",Yellowstone is a Great place to see God's work!,"The entire park is well kept. Old Faithful is a little old and irregular, but, aren't we all as we age!?  Make sure that you drive to every spot you are able to see. Enjoy the hot springs, the pools and geysers and the steam vents!    Get to the canyons and the rivers as well.    Mammoth, to the north, is kind of dry this year. It is still worth seeing.    Watch for stupid people that stop ON THE ROAD instead of pulling over or off. There are plenty of pull out locations to see animals."
9,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021,not available,"Batesville, AR ",Breathtaking Experience,"Seeing the park in pictures is beautiful, but seeing it in person is breathtaking. The wildlife, waterfalls, and giesors are beautiful."
10,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2021 , Couples,"Oklahoma City, OK ",Steamy,"We visited in early October, and the roads were snow packed. We were disappointed that the park did not announce on their website or app that they were not allowing cars in unless they were 4 wheel drive or had snow tires. We had already driven 2 hours to get to the park and didn't learn of that day's requirements until we arrived at the gate. Luckily we had snow chains and were allowed to pull over and put them on and enter the park. Once we got in there, the snow made the trees, fields, and riverways gorgeous; however, the difference between the air temperature and the water made extra steam which made viewing the pools and some geysers nearly impossible. Also, parking lots, scenic pull outs, boardwalks, and sidewalks were extremely icy and treacherous."
11,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021,not available,"Point Lookout, MO ",Nature at it's best,"It was always busy, unless it was very early or very late...and that was OK. Some of the busiest spots were going to be a nightmare, but you went in armed with that knowledge. Talk to a Ranger when you can...let them know how long you're there, and what you want to see...but do your research too...you could drive right past something amazing. Get the audio tour as well...GyPSy Guide...it was annoying at times, but it was good information and gave you areas to skip and stuff you had to see. Also, gauge where you want to go and pick the time that's best. We saw Old Faithful in the morning like first light there was hardly a crowd. Wake up at 0400 and get into some of the areas known for wildlife and just have some coffee and watch for Wolves or grizzlies or Moose. Stay up late too, there's lots of activity at night when most people are off having dinner or even going to sleep. Always keep your eyes peeled and look out for bison roadblocks and just crowds in general. Well worth the trip though, we'll probably go back and focus on hiking in and around the Grand Canyon area as well as Yellowstone Lake which is awesome and underrated in my view."
12,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2021 , Family,"San Diego, CA ",Must see Nat’l Park,"What more can one say about Yellowstone that hasn’t already been said? We went early October to avoid the summer crowds, and it worked. Lots of wildlife (mostly bison) to see all over. The geysers, pools, mud/paint pots, etc. are all spectacular. A beautiful Nat’l Park!"
13,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021,not available,"Phoenix, AZ, ",They Call It Silver Season,"The best time to visit YNP is after Labor Day and before the snow flies. There are a lot less crowds and parking isn't crazy. Hotel prices don't change much but then it is easier to find one also. Lots of animal activity since they are storing up fat for the winder.  Needless to say you still have the people stop on the road for a buffalo picture that is 100 yards away and you still have the buffalo on the road stopping traffic. Great experience that everyone should have.  Plan on spending days, at least 2, here and more if you want to do some things that are not the star attractions."
14,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021,not available,"Fenton, MI ",Bucket list,"Yellowstone is amazing for sure a bucket list trip. Plan for lots of driving, but for sure worth the driving."
15,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021,not available,"new haven, ct ",Don't Read All the Great Reviews...Just GO!,"I have been in several national parks (including Yosemite several times, and the Grand Canyon) and the only one I really want to return to is Yellowstone. So unique, so varied, so huge...so much to see and do. If you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and go. It should be on everyone's list of things to do before you go to that big park in the sky.    This is one of those reviews where the five stars don't cut it, since people will give five stars to anything that is just adequate. It's grade inflation. Yellowstone should have a special ten star designation to distinguish it from every other decent-to-excellent site that rates a five star review (like, say, Venice or Macchu Picchu). They have a slogan there now - ""The First and Best"" National Park - I thought at first that was a little harsh, sort of dissing all those other parks - but you know... they're damned right."
16,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021,not available,"Moncks Corner, SC ",Schedule some time,"We entered through West Yellowstone and drove the southern loop toward Grand Tetons. Amazing to see all the sites, animals, water features and mountains. So many pull offs for great exploring and pictures."
17,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available,"Durham, NC ","Yes, it IS that good!","This is a place of more facets than you might image. Yes, they haev geysers here, and many different types of them, but they also have gorgeous meadows, enticing rivers, a massive lake that looks like a sea, incredible waterfalls, majestic valleys, herds of bison, elk and deer, and just about any wild creature you can imagine. Expect to face traffic jams as tourists crawl past the wildlife (but DON'T feed them) on the many, many miles or road in the park. Do not come for less than 3 days, and if possible make reservations FAR ahead of time to stay in the park. It was worth the exorbitant cost of staying in an on-site hotel."
18,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Saint Cloud, FL ",An amazing place that you could visit forever!,This place is one of the most precious gems in America's crown. So much to see. The whole experience was amazing. I didn't want to leave. And Old Faithful did her thing right on time.
19,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021 , Friends,"Palm Harbor, FL ",Beautiful Yellowstone,"This is a must for a bucket list. Our first time here and we loved all of it. Stunning vistas and wildlife galore. We saw bison, wolves, grizzly bears and elk. Stayed two nights at Silver Gate Lodge, two nights at Yellowstone Basin Inn at Gardiner and two nights at Lake Lodge. Would recommend all of these. Moving around allowed us to see different areas of this beautiful park."
20,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021,not available,"Southern Pines, NC ",Take at least 3 days to experience this!,Yellowstone is definitely one of our favorite National Parks. We only had a day and a half in June so we need to come back. Saw Bison from a distance other than one than ran right in front of our car! Upper and lower falls are worth going to. So much to see in this vast park. I would take 3-7 days if I could do it over again.
21,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021 , Family,Idaho ,A Regular Visitor,This is a must see for everyone.  Have been dozens and dozens of times.  Never gets old.  Best time to go is spring and fall.  Enjoy
22,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021 , Friends,"McKinney, TX, ",Bucket List!!,"What a fantastic place! Gorgeous scenery, amazing things to see, God’s finest handiwork on display!!!    We are on day 3 of our tour but we’ve covered all the park that is currently open. Just breathtaking. Waterfalls, geothermal features, Yellowstone Lake, the rivers, the Grand Canyon (of Yellowstone), the wildlife!!"
23,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021,not available, ,Three Days at Yellowstone - With Short Hikes,"It's really hard to plan a Yellowstone trip if you want to mix some light day hiking in with seeing all the sights and you're toggling between multiple apps and maps. Oh, and you are doing it in 3 days. The FOMO on this trip was tremendous.    Basics: A couple, no kids, post-Labor Day visit. Based our stay in West Yellowstone.    On drive up from Grand Teton: Black Sand Basin at sunset. Nice, quick, pretty little pools, geysers.    Day 1: Biscuit Basin with hike to Mystic Falls (the 1-way version, not the loop). Lovely. Biscuit Basin is beautiful early in the morning, the falls are pretty. Not too strenuous. 2.6 miles total.    Hiked to Overlook to watch Old Faithful do its thing. Less crowded and lovely view . Hike is straight uphill, but short. 1.5 miles total.    There is an intricate network of boardwalks in the Old Faithful area but the geothermal features near the Geyser are quite blah compared to Black Sand and Biscuit.    The overlook option for the Grand Prismatic view. 2 ways to see this. Chose the Fairy Falls trailhead parking lot (less crowded) and hiked to the observation deck to see the Grand Prismatic pool. Don't miss this. 2.11 miles total.    On way back to West Yellowstone. Get some camping chairs or just sit in your car at one of turnouts along the rivers. Enjoy the late afternoon.    Day 2: Mammoth Falls. Husband loved it. I thought it was kind of dull. Looks exactly like the pictures. The drive up there is lovely.    North Rim of Yellowstone Grand Canyon - Supposedly not as nice as South Rim but still lovely. Hiking down to Lookout Point is not necessary unless you want to burn a lot of calories coming up.    Norris Geyser overlook. Not worth it. There was always a traffic jam at the Geyser itself, but if you park on the road look for the.park service signs pointing to a trail that takes you to the Geyser so you don't have to walk to the (and then thru) the parking lot.    Artist Paint Pots - Skip it. It looks like an abandoned gravel quarry. The least interesting geothermal feature we saw.    Gibbon Falls - A nice leg stretcher pullout.    Day 3 South Rim of Grand Canyon. You can do this all in one day but we were driving down to Jackson that afternoon so split it up. Beautiful views. The trail from Uncle Tom's Overlook (closed) to Artist's Point is way more than .55. The roundtrip using the road to get back (a little shorter) was 2.36. It is broken up concrete trail with lots of ups and downs. With a little planning you can craft a 4 or 5 mile hike along the rim, to a lake and back to the parking lot. Wapiti trail is involved.    Storm Point trail to Yellowstone Lake - A little bit out of the way but so lovely. We did the out and back to the point (2 miles) you an also loop (that's about 2.45). You get meadow, woods, and a gorgeous lake beach.    West Thumb geothermal features. The pools next to the lake provide a striking contrast. It's also a very quick place to visit and parking was easy.    Food - Some places were closed in September and it was Hit or miss on quality. General stores are well-stocked with picnic foods and the park is full of picnic tables. We did that on the last day and it was the best option."
24,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available,"Fort Worth, TX ",Must See,Yellowstone National Park should be on everyone's bucket list. This park is unlike any other on Earth!
25,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021 , Couples,"North East, MD ",Showering now that they are closed in the park,"Campers in Canyon Campground or Madison looking for shower locations highly recommend traveling to West Yellowstone, Madison Hotel.    Clean shower room, private towels, washcloth, bath mat provided. $15.00 no time limit."
26,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021 , Couples, ,Spectacular! Add this amazing National Park to your 🪣 list.,"Day 1. Started at the West entrance and headed north all the way up to Mammoth Springs (north entrance). Pretty much stopped at every attraction along the way, in most cases we were able to find a place to park fairly easily. Day 2. West entrance again, followed the south loop clear down to the Grand Tetons (south entrance), stopping at Old Faithful, and Prismatic Springs, of course. We actually stopped at Prismatic Springs twice because there was so much steam early morning we could not see much, on the way back we hiked up to the top of the hill site to look down at it to view the beautiful colors. Not for the faint of heart, but worth it for the view. Because of the forest fire smoke blowing in from the western part of the United States, the mountains were not in super clear view unfortunately. During the two days - animal sightings included bull elks, bison, pronghorn and teeny tiny chipmunks 🐿. No bears… but we did carry bear spray everywhere we went, to be safe. Hiked about 14 miles total during the two day adventure. There were some edges and ledges along the southern loop for those afraid of “the edge”…Did notice a lot of handicap accessible areas and restrooms which was nice to see. Most places were dog 🐶 friendly as well outdoors, and paths were clearly marked if dogs were not allowed. The visitors centers were basically closed due to covid, but park rangers we accessible for questions. Found it odd that all the gift stores were open?? Pack a face mask. NPS still requiring them in indoor spaces. Note some signage is somewhat ambiguous, you can easily miss a turn off if not paying close attention. DOWNLOAD the NPS Yellowstone National Park App before you go. Best way to know where to stop and really great descriptions of each spot. Works even when your phone won’t as well, picks up GPS. For those of you worried about getting lost or if you are hesitant in driving yourself around (rather than a tour bus), it is pretty much impossible not to figure your way around, basically just one road! Unless you go to some of the remote trails, you really don’t need hiking shoes or hiking boots either. Most of the trails or either boardwalks or very accessible. Plain old sneakers worked great, but got really dusty (so don’t wear white…). If you need a hat to protect you from the sun, make sure you wear a hat that is secured on your head tight or has a tie under your chin, saw lots of them blown off in the hot springs and geyser areas, which wasn’t pretty to look at. There were no bugs, mosquitoes, or other pesky pests to deal with during this time of the year either. The crowds were also very manageable, never felt like we were rushed, pushed along, or overwhelmed with people around us. During one of the hikes we took towards the west entrance, we actually didn’t even see one other person. Enjoy your time at Yellowstone, we sure did!"
27,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Shoreview, MN ",Awesome visit!!,"This is such an amazing place to visit.The park is huge and has so many areas to see.We were able to see some animals like bison,elk,fox,bears,mule deer and wolves.There are many areas to stop for photos.A few places to eat and put gas.This is just a great place to relax and have fun.We recommend highly."
28,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Chicopee, MA ",Lamar Valley so Amazing,"This was our second visit to Yellowstone. The first was from the South entrance this time from the East. We thoroughly loved the eastern entrance driving up to the Lamar Valley, plenty of beauty and wildlife along the way. There were bathrooms along the way and picnic areas which was great. Also visitor centers. The Lamar Valley area is like no other in the park, with so many Buffalo and antelope. If in the park this area is a must see."
29,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available,"Maumee, OH ",A Must!,"Yellowstone is just outstanding! The beauty, the diversity of wildlife, and the different hikes just makes this place a bucket list location. We booked our hotels 11 months in advance and went to most tourists locations early in the morning to beat the crowds. Also, we planned out our days in advance which I would advise to do. We researched the internet and watched YouTube videos to determine what sights we wanted to see and planned accordingly.    To really get to see wildlife, we used Yellowstone Safari and our guide Zak. We got to see moose, wolves, mountain goats, pronghorn, elk and thousands of bison. Well worth the money spent."
30,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available, ,Truly An Experience,"Cold, raining most of the two days we were there, and very, very wet, but still an experience I would not have missed. The geysers, the colors, the steam rising everywhere, the lakes filled with hot water, the streams trickling by, filled with hot water. What a show Mother Nature puts on daily at this park. The majesty, the awe-inspiring venting of steam and hot water...I will always remember all of it. And I have the photos to go with the memories."
31,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available, ,A Wonder of Nature,"This is a very large park with lots to see. Old Faithful is a must along with Yellowstone Falls.

32,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available,"Seattle, WA ",No showers in the campgrounds and no exhibits in the visitor centers. Thats bison %&$*,"We just spent a week at Yellowstone NP in the Grant Village campground again for a week and what a disappointment. The second day we were there we asked the person at the desk at the Grant Village Campground how showers work this year at the park. The gal at the desk said there where no showers avaiable at any of the campgrounds in the park. She recommended bathing in the lake. At no point were we notified in the reservation or confirmation process that showers were not available. She said it was due to staff shortages. We also went to several visitor centers and NONE of the exhibits were open, but ALL of the gift shops. The ranger behind a piece of glass said it was due to staff shortages. I asked if it had anything to do with Covid. He said, ""Well, that too."" So riddle me this, I can be back to back with people crammed in a gift shop to buy a shot glass with a bison on it, but I can't see any of the exhibits in the SAME building. Wow. National Park Service, you let us down."
33,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021,not available,"Livermore, CA ",Natural Beauty Combined With Horrible Summer Services,"Yellowstone Nation Park is truly a wonder of the world. It is a vast collection of wonders ranging from mountains, forests, geysers, lakes to animals of all types. This summer has seen the park setting records for the number of visitors and records for the frustrations of these visitors because of the lack of services and facilities.    If you plan to visit the park with the current concessionaire running the facilities and restaurants come prepared to wait in long lines, get poor service and vastly overpay for everything from potato chips to rooms. The advice I can give is to come in early June or after the first of September but in any case, bring food and drinks enough to get you through your stay. Doing so witll greatly reduce your frustration and allow you to enjoy the magnificence of the park."
34,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021 , Couples,"Whitefish, MT, ",Well preserved and vast park,"This park is well maintained and vast. Thousands of visitors come to this park annually from all over the world. Old Faithful Geyser is probably the main attraction of the park. However, there are so many other things to explore."
35,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available,"Rochester, MN, ",Get a Guide or stay a wekk,"If you only have a day or two, I would strongly recommend hiring a guide. You will otherwise get stuck in traffic, lines, or generally not see all that you would otherwise. The park is enormous and takes tons of planning to effectively do on your own otherwise."
36,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021 , Couples,"Indialantic, FL ",Pros and cons of visiting Yellowstone,"We recently returned from four days in Yellowstone in early August. This was our second visit to this beautiful park. People who have never been to Yellowstone need to understand the vastness of this park and the amount of time you spend in your car traveling to see the different points of interest. Because of this I would highly suggest you take cooler, even a soft sided insulated cooler bag and bring along luncheon meat cheese mayonnaise squeezable. Also bring fruit chips bread and of course water or things to drink. You will be spending a lot of time during the day traveling to and from in your car or stopped to view animals and or geysers and taking hikes to view the natural wonders. One of the things we did this trip was to take the boat tour on the beautiful Yellowstone lake. Well worthThe time in small fee. During peak summer months it is recommended to get a reservation ahead of time. Trips in the early morning are usually available. This time we stayed at the lake large cabins and enjoyed it not the pioneer cabins those were built in the 20s and are a bit more rustic although cheaper. We have also stayed in the small yellow cabins at the lake hotel. One thing to note at this time is there is a problem with eating at the restaurants. First of all masks are required. And there is no indoor seating except for a small percentage at the lake hotel. This is very impactful and difficult. The lines are longAnd all food is carry out with hardly any seating areas outdoors. If the weather is inclement I guess you could take it back to your cabin or eat in your car. Yellowstone used to be delightful to have a nice evening meal with live music piano or string Quartet at the lake hotel. I hope those days Will return. We ate a lunch at the Old Faithful cafeteria and you eat out of Styrofoam boxes on trees sitting on a bench outside. If you know ahead of time and bring some food or snacks it is doable but not as pleasant as Yellowstone used to be. ICE is free at all of the lodges I would suggest bringing some Ziploc bags as they don’t always have containers. Yellowstone is not to be missed in your lifetime. There still are many animals roaming free and wild and the geysers and vents in the Hot Springs in mineral pools are a sight to behold nowhere else like it in the world even with allThe virus restrictions it’s still well worth the time and money to visit this beautiful park."

39,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021 , Family, ,Yellowstone,"We went later in the day as we were told we would see more wildlife and we did. We just had to drive those curvy roads at night, very scary! We saw fox, bear, lots of buffalo, elk and other animals."
40,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021,not available,"Columbia, MD, ",Great National Park,"My husband and I stayed in West Yellowstone, MT and arrived to the line into the park at around 7:45 am. If we came before 8am with a long line, I could only imagine the line getting into the park later in the day. Yellowstone is well known for the geysers - the most popular being Old Faithful. It also has beautiful scenery and wildlife. The boardwalks and viewing the geysers is the one thing everyone should do when visiting Yellowstone. These geysers are unlike anything I've ever seen before. They are also very crowded and it can get difficult to find parking. Old Faithful has a large viewing area. All I could wonder was what's going on underneath Yellowstone and what it going to look like in a few hundred years. If it's a giant super volcano underneath, I'm glad I got to view it now before the area is destroyed. Besides seeing the geysers, we also saw a waterfall, a few signs for the continental divide and beautiful scenery."
41,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021 , Family, ,Maybe overrated compared to other local parks…,"It’s beautiful & unlike anything we’ve ever seen before & we’ve traveled a lot. However, I believe it’s overrated. We expected to see a lot of wildlife & while there’s TONS of Buffalo, I mean you will not go here & not see them, I promise, the rest of the wildlife is few & far between compared to what I expected. Alaska has MUCH, MUCH more. Don’t get me wrong, we saw all the animals they tell u to watch for except a black bear, but plan to go a long time w/o seeing anything. My kids said they were bored, but they loved Alaska, so it’s not the environment. It was the lack of prevalent wildlife (outside of Buffalo). Lots of driving & lines for parking at main attractions. Try parking at Old Faithful Inn to see Old Faithful. It’s a piece of cake! So, here’s the deal, my kids liked the Badlands better & so did I. There’s other lesser known places like Bighorn Canyon National Park and Beartooth Pass that are far superior in my mind. I’m with a group of 2 families with teens & all of us agree we like the smaller parks more & saw more wildlife in the others. We were able 2 do Yellowstone in 3 days stopping at all of the main attractions & some smaller ones. Plan for time 2 get stuck behind animals in the road."
42,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021 , Family, ,No staff and meal services poor at best,Stay away this year. Complete lack of staffing in hotels and by National Parks. Crowded and no parking. Minimal meals and what is offer is sold out. We are checking out early
43,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021,not available,"Miami, FL ","Crowded, rude people, heavy trafic","The Park was overly crowded, with rude, oblivious people. Sort of sucked the joy out of the scenic beauty. Traffic was terrible as it took a long time to get to any destination. Wait time to get into the entrance was long. If you want to wait on long lines you might as well go to Disney land."

July 2021 our trip began in Chicago, on the way to Yellowstone we enjoyed Wisconsin Dells, La Crosse -Shrine of Our Lady Guadalupe, Sioux Falls, SD - Falls Park is very nice. Badlands National Park -wow! Black Hills National Forest – Custer State Park and Mt Rushmore. Cody, Wyoming – Buffalo Bill Center of the West (museum-awesome!)  discover Cody-it is a must see. We spent 2 days there. See the Dan Miller Cowboy Music revue…17 years and running.  Driving from Cody to Yellowstone is beautiful. Upon entering the park, we drove to the Old Faithful Inn and met at the Visitors Center for our Day 1 with Wildland Trekking hikes. The Geyser area was our first hike. The second part of the hike was Mystic Falls and the rim above. The day’s mileage was 9.2 miles and could easily be 2 days of hikes. We are in great condition and loved the challenge of pushing to 9 miles hiking.  Jennifer our Wildland Trekking guide was awesome. She really knew the park, history and answered all of our “why” and “how” questions. She is a really nice person and the lunch provided was very tasty!  Day 2 was a different amazing at 8500 feet elevation on Bunsen Peak with magnificent mountain views. We me out next Wildland Trekking guide Adriana at the bottom of the peak. This was a rise of only 1200 feet however it is strenuous and a good work out. Literally walking up switchbacks of volcanic rock that moves under your every step on the edge of the Peak. Exciting -Yes ! Once on top, we had another good lunch provided by our guide. Adriana was very nice and knew thew highlights to talk to us about. She even found wild raspberries to eat at on the hike.  The Day 3 hike was even more spectacular in viewing the Yellowstone treasure. We hiked the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone Park. Adriana was our guide again and we had another 6.5 miles added to our total on this day. We began on the edge of the Canyon walking the trail all the way, then looped through a field looking for buffalo. Through more geysers, bubbling mud pots, bubbling pools and general “regular ole” Yellowstone sights. A great day. We had such an amazing time!!    Jennifer and Adriana were so knowledgeable and made all of our experiences something that we will never forget! We feel so lucky to have had this experience.  My niece also had an amazing time and has a new love for the outdoors, hiking, and national parks. The hikes in this order day 1 to 3 and lunches were amazing.    Thank you Wildland Trekking so much for everything!!  We will definitely be hiking with you again!    Forever grateful, The Obermeyer’s"
45,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2021 , Friends,World ,One of the most beautiful places,Absolutely beautiful place. Do yourself a favor and pay the 35 dollars to enter. Which is good for 1 week. Take the loop around yellowstone and visit all the important sites like old faithful and canyon village. There are many beautiful locations worthy of pictures. From the many geysers along the route to the many animals that inhabit the park. There are many spots to stop at and a wide variety of stores to buy souvenirs and food.
46,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2021 , Family,"Crystal Lake, IL ",Fabulous for everyone but the dog,"Even though we were limited in what we could do because we had our dog with us and Yellowstone is not a dog-friendly park, we had an incredible visit! In one day, we were able to see nearly all of the park by taking quick turns through the loops. We encountered a few traffic jams in which bison were involved either because they were crossing the road or people were stopping on the road to watch. There are so many other geysers to see, other than Old Faithful, and we got to witness a couple of the smaller ones which was well worth the walks. We were thrilled to see so much wildlife - just didn’t see wolves (bummer). We were greeted by a Grizzly with her cub which was spectacular! All-in-all, everyone loved our visit to the park, except the dog who had to stay in the car everywhere except Old Faithful. While the family was getting a day of exercise, sunshine, and fresh (sometimes) air, our pup was limited to the space in and around our car."
47,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021,not available,"Sacramento, CA ",Yellowstone trip,"We recently went to Yellowstone National park from end of July to 3rd August. A must visit. Here are few do's and don'ts.  Was too hot and I wish I had packed more shorts and T shirts  We took way too much snacks. I would recommend taking a waffle maker and hot water kettle.  Do try to stay in the park, it makes life much easy and convenient.  Avoid Norris geyser basin and mammoth falls. Not worth the time.  Try to see the old faithful from two different sides.  We had no power one day in the Canyon Village lodge. It was an eye opener as no food. So be prepared.  Way too crowded, so have patience. Print maps in advance"
48,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021 , Couples,"Bend, OR ",Not Worth the trip this year,"The website says fully open. Not! We went camping inside the park a big mistake. All showers in Yellowstone closed. Most restaurants closed with some providing convenience store microwave quality take out. Water fountains off and many flush restrooms closed. Talked to rangers and they said the disorganization of opening and federal employees and seasonal employees refusing to come off unemployment has led to an extreme lack of staffing. So the park is not clean and properly maintained as in the past. Yet all the campgrounds and hotels are full without proper planning, support or personnel. We left after one night."
49,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021 , Family,Brayme ,A lot of fun with the granddaughter,I enjoyed all of Yellowstone but this time I did the two hour horse back ride with the cowboy cookout. The ride was nice with spectacular views. We rode for eight miles. When we arrived at the cookout you could smell the steaks. To my surprise this was all you could eat. We sat around listening to live county music. A Bear tried to join us but the wranglers kept him away. After dinner we got back on the Horsea d rode back to the corral. It was a pleasant evening lasting I about five hours total. It was a lot of fun. I would do it again.

Stay in the park, get out early or late to avoid the crowds and experience the majesty of Yellowstone"
51,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021 , Couples,"Bloomington, MN, ","Dare we say, it’s not tourist friendly?","Ya, you are thinking you are heading to one of the most heavily traveled wonders of the world. You see pictures of thousands and millions of visitors going here. You think of the Bison and the beautiful scenery. There are truly wonders here you will never see anywhere else. Now reality. We came in the late afternoon and evening when the crowds were light. Think about standing in long lines of cars an hour to go 15 miles. Other than the geysers, hot pools and Yellowstone Falls, there’s the same thing in surrounding Wyoming and Colorado. Drive to the top of Beartooth Pass out of Red Lodge Montana and return back down to Red Lodge. We went over the pass and continued into Yellowstone. Think about exorbitant gas, filthy/non-existent bathrooms, no food, thousands of cars and rude people and, this summer, very hot. Yellowstone became a check-off park rather than a bucket list item after our experience here. It drives me out of my mind writing this review. We drove from Billings through Yellowstone to Idaho Falls. We are glad we stayed nowhere near the park, but we were exhausted and closed roads in Yellowstone prevented us from the 1 day quick take highlights. Allow way more time than you think and back in your own food and have a full tank of gas when you get close. Very expensive and crowded, the kids will spend most of the day in the car. We did see families swimming downstream from the hot pools and it looked like a blast (south of Wesr Entance intersection about halfway to Old Faithful). About Old Faithful. Bring your lawn chairs and sit back on the nasty dirt. We differed on Old Faithful; too many people, very crowded, giant parking lot, nasty bathrooms, nasty food at exorbitant prices. We would loved to have camped here, but reservations or fighting for a camping spot. We just didn’t know how to do this park. This is our 3rd National Park this week and we found them poorly maintained, bad roads, lack of clean bathrooms and too many people. I know, what a terrible review about our National treasures."
52,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021,not available,Central California ,Nature's beauty - and lots of buffalo,"Entered Yellowstone from Cody around noon and entered immediately. East part of the park has burned recently so not quite as scenic until Lake Yellowstone. Noticed several restrooms area closed, but still plenty available. All dining until next year is take-out, no inside seating per friendly (and overworked) Xanterra staff. The waterfalls are breathtaking and lots of buffalo strolling alongside or laying down in the roadway (be patient, it's worth it!). Didn't go by Old Faithful on this trip because of road construction which impacted traffic. Exited to West Yellowstone with plenty of elk, deer and other wildlife."
53,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ","Great Views, but crowded and a little repetitive","Some amazing views of mountains, rivers, waterfalls, and of course, geysers and springs. We visited Grand Teton the previous day, and we both thought it was a little more scenic. That's not a knock on Yellowstone, it is beautiful, but eventually there are only so many geysers you can see before it starts to get a little boring. It was also much more crowded than Grand Teton. I would definitely still recommend it, but maybe research and plan exactly what you want to see to avoid unnecessary diversions. A lot of travel sites say you need 2 or 3 days to see everything, but we saw almost all the major sites in just 1. If you really want to see EVERY attraction in detail. then you might need a second day."
54,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,Bellaire ,Disappointedly Bored,"Lifetime goal to visit Yellowstone so stayed at Old Faithful Lodge for 7 days. Lodge was fine (food bad) but park sights were mostly underwhelming. Saw lots of bison but no other wildlife of interest. After a couple of geysers, you've seen them all. South rim trail was the only hike we deemed scenic. Long drives between sights. The previous week we had stayed at Glacier Park which is much more scenic and interesting."
55,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2021 , Couples,"Mooresville, NC ",Make Plans to Go Now,"We spent a week in Yellowstone. We visited all four sections of the park. Highly recommend Lamar Valley to see wildlife. We stayed in the park Lodges in order to save travel time each day. We stayed in Old Faithful Lodge, Old Lodge Snow and Mammoth. Old Faithful Lodge cabins are really just utility sheds with a tiny bathroom. It's a rustic adventure. The other Lodge were very nice hotels. Dining options were very limited. All meals had to be eaten elsewhere. No dining in. Really wish they had more picnic tables and benches. We had room or tailgate picnics. Recommend that you buy a cooler and stock it for simple meals and snacks. Bear spray - ask your hotel if they have some or see the Yellowstone Facebook sharing page. Dress for all weather types. We did the Yellowstone geyser bus tour. Good experience. Get the gypsy app. We'll work every penny! Enjoy!"
56,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Family, ,"Busy, Crowded but still Beautiful",As beautiful as ever. Yellowstone doesn’t disappoint. We have been here several times before but we did note some considerable differences.    The amount of people visiting the park was shocking. Even mid week there were times where we had to wait in line for over an hour to enter the west Yellowstone gate.    The crowds were the same at all the major tourist locations. And caused traffic jams inside of the park.    There were regular lines to get back out of the park. The wait was even longer to get back out of the park. One evening was about 2 hours.    Due to COVID a lot of the restaurants in the park weren’t open.
57,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021 , Couples, ,Amazing Visit,"We have been planning this trip for a year and Yellowstone is unforgettable! The first day we arrived by 5 and had breakfast while the sun rose. We beat the traffic and had some sights almost to ourselves. Old Faithful was phenomenal, but there are many other fascinating geysers to see. Bison, deer and elk were easily spotted."

As we went in May many of the stores were not open but we knew that before we got into the park and brought food and drink with us each day.    Fuel was available in the park using credit card.    We spent three very long and full days in the park and could've done with at least one more.    We based ourselves in Livingston, MT and entered / exited through the North Entrance (in Gardiner, MT) each day.    We will be back ........"
60,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021,not available,"Fort Lauderdale, FL ",Nice park but too much driving,"Yellowstone is not my favorite national park. It is too much driving to get to see a sight. Mostly geothermal features and then the entire park looks the same. Some of the attractions get crowded. It's nice but be prepared to drive alot. Bring food in the park also as not too many stops that have real food options. I would assume most people like this if they want to see animals. Prefer Grand Canyon, Sedonna, Zion."

And you never know what animal might show up. (Currently in the summer of 2021, the crowds and parking is terrible. Get there before 8am or after 4pm if there is something you really want to see. Otherwise, have multiple back up plans of what you want to see.)"

65,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Solo,"Fountain, CO ",There is no equal anywhere in the world,"Nothing comes close to the grandeur that is yellowstone. If it were broken into separate parks, each would still be a peerless gem in the NPS. The north is a wildlife sanctuary that is simply outstanding. The geyser basins are a geologic marvel that can't be matched anywhere in the world. The canyon area has some of the finest waterfalls in the country. Words just can't describe yellowstone"
66,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2021 , Friends,"Marietta, GA ",Wait till after COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted!!,"We just returned from our Yellowstone trip. I rated the trip 3 out 5 due to COVID-19 restrictions still in place by the federal government. That combined with overcrowding and lack of parking caused problems. There was also a lack of employees to handle the crowds due to COVID and the fact that they probably make more free money from the Feds than they would make going back to work at this time. As far as the natural aspect, it was not a disappointment and was magnificent to see all the sites."

68,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021,not available,California ,A marvel,"What a fantastic place! My husband and I had never visited before and we were blown away by all of the animals and beauty here. We saw black bears, grizzly bears, wolves, bison, elk and pronghorn during our 4 days driving in and out of the park. We saw the most animals in Lamar Valley (Northeast entrance), but also loved seeing the Mammoth Hot Springs (North entrance) and geysers (West entrance) too. The best part was not knowing what you would see every day. We had a wonderful trip and highly recommend it to others (at least for what we saw in the month of June)."
69,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Couples,"Graham, TX ",June 2021- YNP/GTNP,"This is not my first time to either parks but my first time to write a trip report. I read Trip Advisor every day. It may not be the greatest but here goes. Our family has been here at least 8-9 times and wish we could go much more but is quite a drive from Texas.Started out at night, less traffic on road, and drove 12 hours to Cheyenne. Most of the time we can check in early to our room but this clerk at Days Inn was very adamant that we could not check in until 3:00 pm, check in time. We tried to several times but the answer was always no. So we waited and waited for 3 hours. Drove to Cody next day so we could get into Yellowstone early next day. Always stay at Cody Cowboy Village-it’s so cute. Ate at Cassie’s-pricy but okay.Got supplies at Walmart and drove through East Entrance en route to Madison Campground. We were originally booked at Bridge Bay from 6/6-6/13 but found out through handy/ dandy Trip Advisor that Yellowstone put Phase 1 restrictions in place and wouldn’t open until 6/11. So had to replace Bridge Bay with Madison. Would have much preferred Bridge Bay.Driving through East Entrance we saw bighorn sheep on side of road and then a lone grizzly in a field. Good start for wildlife! Also an eagle flying overhead. Set up camp and as soon as we were set up, the campground host came by and said you have to take your shower tent down and you cannot idle your car to charge things. And I’m thinking I know I read on Trip Advisor where someone had e-mailed Yellowstone and said shower tents were okay as long as you contained and disposed of water correctly. Oh no, that is not allowed. Argued with her to no avail. You cannot get a single drop of water on the ground, according to her. So not a good start for Day 1 of 7. And we were right by the road going to West Yellowstone so cars all day and night. We did see a grizzly and her Cubs between Norris and Mammoth but she was way up on a hill behind a log.An elk had walked about 50 yards downhill from her and we thought might see some action, but the grizzly never moved. She did move though when a ranger used a loudspeaker to make sure cars were over the white line.To sum up Yellowstone- have never seen so many visitors as we did in early June. Tons of people in gift shops but couldn’t open showers. Never could get into Midway Geyser Basin or Norris. The Upper Old Faithful general store was wall-to-wall people. We did drive the Beartooth Highway to the Top of the World store, which we had never done. Had to wait 30 minutes for construction on both ends . Saw Crazy Creek Falls, which was cool. Also visited the Bechler area and saw Cave Falls, which we had never seen either. Wildlife- 3 grizzlies, one with Cubs, 5 black bears, 2 foxes, multiple bison and elk, but no elk calves which seemed weird. Anyway this is long enough and good or bad, we would go to Yellowstone any time!!"

71,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021,not available,"Santa Monica, CA ",Spectacular and wonderful,"What can one say about Yellowstone National Park that has not been said before? Most probably look like nothing. Nevertheless, we spent three days driving through the park and three days is the minimum that we would recommend. of course everybody makes a beeline for Old Faithful and rightly so. But there is so much outs an offer here. Even driving through the hundreds of miles of road is a pleasure in light of the spectacular scenery.    Many people stay at West Yellowstone. And by 8 AM there is quite a back up of traffic seeking entry into the park. Not as bad as the Grand Canyon but it can take a good 10 to 20 minutes to gain entry. The best that is to get a one-year national Park pass and stay to the far right for the pre-paid entries.    Getting to the park as early as possible can also reduce waiting times for parking spaces where there are geysers or hot pools.    All in all a wonderful and unforgettable experience."
72,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021,not available,"Birch Run, MI, ",Yellowstone is amazing,How do I even write a review for the most iconic national park in the USA? We visited here recently and were just blown away by pretty much everything we saw. We spent 4 days in the park and every day was different. We stayed outside the park 2 nights then at Mammoth Hot Springs in a cabin (a favorite) and Old Faithful also in a cabin (not so good although the location is perfect for watching OF do her thing multiple times). Lots of time spent in Lamar Valley checking out the wildlife and also at the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. We loved everything except Norris Geyser Basin but at that time we may have been just overwhelmed and didn't appreciate the smell. Otherwise a 5 star experience. Just go if you haven't already.

74,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Family,"Easley, SC ",So much BEAUTY!!!!!,"I need a word that beats INCREDIBLE!!!!!! We spent 2 1/2 days at Yellowstone and feel that we could spend another week there and still not see it all. We saw sooooo many animals - a huge herd of buffalo crossed the road in front of us; elk; antelope; deer; and the list goes on. Yes, Old Faithful is amazing, but don’t neglect seeing so many other equally amazing sights that don’t get as much hype. We really enjoyed the Mud Volcano and the Fountain Paint Pot on the Lower Loop. The Prismatic Spring - with its amazing colors - is worth the hike. On the Upper Loop, be sure to take in Mammoth Hot Springs and the Artist Paint Pot. The drive through Lamar Valley is a must for spotting wildlife. We saw multiple huge herds of buffalo, in addition to the super large herd that crossed the road while we watched in amazement. SUGGESTION: For Old Faithful, make the effort to hike up to the observation point for viewing. Parts of the trail are steep, but viewing the geyser going off from the vantage point of above is so much more impressive than at ground level, which we also did."

81,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Family, ,The secret to not waiting in line at Yellowstone ...,Sometimes you might think to skip Yellowstone because of all the lines - but I have a secret! I always go to busy national parks around 4pm and there are hardly ever any lines and most of the crowds are gone. You can always find a parking space and you don’t have to wait. We were able to see Old Faithful as well as fire hole river. It was amazing!!!

83,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Couples,"Palmetto, FL ",Magnificent views and geology.,"It had been 17 years since our last visit and much has changed. There were a few more walk over areas in the spring basins south of the West entrance and two of the famous geysers Old Faithful and Steamboat were fairly quiet on the days we visited. It is very beautiful and the bison were visible in many areas. This park requires a lot of maintenance on the boardwalks, could certainly use more restrooms to handle the volume of visitors, ant the roadways need some widening to accommodate drive around when lines build up at pull outs. Parking lots cannot accommodate enough vehicles at major sites within the park. One expects some delays however the traffic buildup needs to be better controlled."
84,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Family,"Austin, TX ",Truly mind blowing and hope to go every year,"Mind blowing trip. I’ve never had any desire to go here, I’m scared of bears, wolves, bison, steamy geysers, boiling battery acid water, in other words, not my idea of fun. My son picked it off the map, and he’s 26, so I decided I wasn’t going to let fear control my life, and we are doing this! Begrudgingly...well, I absolutely fell madly in love with this place and everything it stands for. We went mid March, so there where no crowds whatsoever, but we were only allowed a tiny fraction of the park, roads were closed because of snow, construction, or animal activity. What a magical, mysterious place! I hope to return after the crowds leave. To explore some more. We had bison traveling so close to our car we could’ve reached out and touched them. We saw snow capped mountains, streams, rivers, so many different types of geysers, from mighty to just a mud burping spitting one. It was very windy, don’t forget your sunscreen, your hat, your hat should be secured, we saw a few truckers type hats blown out onto the fragile bacterial mats. Take your bear spray, or your bear bells, water, and snacks. The bison, or elk herds, may cross the road and delay you a couple of hours or more, so be prepared. Have fun! Take lots of pictures."
85,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Family,"Muldrow, OK ",America's first nation park,"Yellowstone is one of America's treasures. There are so many geysers and springs to see. The major sites are very busy and some places the parking is limited. Be prepared to hurry up and wait. If there is a animal sighting the roads come to a standstill. We saw mostly bison during our visit, but many others are possible. There was a lot of hype about bears, but we saw zero bears. We didn't feel it was necessary to buy $50 bear spray or rent it. In other words, just don't expect to see bears. They are there and you might see one, but it is more likely you will see her animals. The beauty of the park is definitely worth visiting for."
86,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2021 , Family,Japan ,Amazing,"We only had one day to drive from sight to sight, but it was still spectacular. Even in a high traffic time of the year, we were able to see several hot springs and attractions, including Mammoth Springs and Old Faithful, without problem.    All staff were lovely despite the customer crush, with the exception of one receptionist at Canyon Campground.    We saw antelope, elk, deer, bison, and possible a bear in the woods."
87,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2021,not available,"The Woodlands, TX, ",Well Worth The Trip,"Although we were disappointed with the lack of wildlife we encountered for this time of year, the scenic overlooks, mud pots, colorful fountain paint pots, geysers and waterfalls were amazing, interesting and worth the trip. Reaching these spots required long drives, walking thru crowds of people and we often encountered a lack of parking spaces. We stayed at Headwaters in the Tetons so the drive to get anywhere was lengthy and sometimes blocked by bison herds in excess of 45 minutes. It is worth seeing but be prepared for traffic, long waits and crowds even in early May when no Yellowstone visitor centers were open and campgrounds/hotels were still closed. All in all, highly recommended."
88,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2021,not available,"Vallejo, CA, ",Yellowstone is Amaz,"One thing that stands out for me, is that our 5 days here is NOT enough time to take in all that Yellowstone has to offer. Take away all the main attractions, and you can find countless spots to see and enjoy. We loved our trip here, finding off the beaten path, places to explore. Like I said, 5 days is not enough."
89,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2021 , Family,"Penngrove, CA ",Put your patient 🎩 hat on and go anyway!,"Quick review: just left the park on 6/4/21. Expect large crowds and slowdowns for wildlife, especially at the West Entrance, Gibbon River Canyon, and Norris Geyser basin --- basically anywhere where it's difficult to find a turnout.  Arrive by 7:30 AM or enter after 3 PM. You'll still have a slowdown in the morning, but you can get to major attractions earlier and, thus find more parking and fewer crowds.  Food: bring it into avoid long waits and unpredictable openings.  Water: carry extra for reasons above.  If staying in West Yellowstone, consider doing takeout instead of dine-in to avoid long waits.  If you're not committed to lodging yet, check around *any other* entrance besides West Yellowstone. You'll have a longer drive to major sights but you'll get there faster.  Everyone was unfailingly polite ... do your best to continue the trend, follow the Rangers instructions. And, for goodness sakes, DO NOT APPROACH WILDLIFE!!!"
90,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2021,not available,"Jacksonville, FL ",Great but aggrivating,"This was our 2nd trip to YNP and there are many things I could say. The park is truely a place that must be seen completely to appreciate. It cannot be seen fully in 1, 2, or 3 days, you really need a solid week to see most things, even with that you will miss things. We were there a solid 8 days and experienced a lot of weather from 1 side of the park to the other. We stayed in West Yellowstone for the majority of our stay so each day included a long drive, going 20 miles at 40-45mph takes a while. We would go from a snow storm in the west to a clear day in the east. Weather was all over the place. We committed to see every entrance of the park. On day 1 we drove from West Yellowstone to Mammoth, to Lenar Valley to the North East entrance, we say tons of bison and their young, Prong horn, Bighorn Sheep, 1 Grizzly. Another day we went to the South entrance, over the great divide 6 times. Not many animals to see but great views and scenery. Another day we hiked all of the thermal sites in the Old Faithful area, Marmots and Chipmunks were the animals of the day. The gysers and springs are a must see. Another day we crossed the entire park West to East, around the lake, over Avalanche pass to the East entrance. We saw Bighorn Sheep on the cliffsides near the pass. The pass was covered in snow and it was also blizzard like. We also saw Marmots from the lake overlook. We were able to see most of the animals you want to see while there. During our stay we saw Bison, Elk, Pronghorn, Wolves, Coyotes, A cinnimon Black bear with 2 young cubs, a Brown bear, and Marmot. Awsome!    Now the aggrivation. The weather was very unpredictable. Some areas we were unable to enjoy due to trails being closed for Bear conservancy. The lodges were mostly closed so we needed to bring everything into the park for the day, NPS is in Phase 1 opening while everything around the park, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming were completely open. Food options were very limited and fairly unacceptable in the park, so you better bring it if you want it. Further aggrivation would be the noticable disrepair of the NPS, poor/old/unreadable signage, closed trails from disrepair, substandard lodging, roads in disrepair. Not blaming the NPS just pointing out, lack of funding for our jewels, the NPS."
91,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2021,not available,Seattle ,National park worth seeing.,"Nothing to add in regard to the astounding sights others have detailed, but just warnings to newcomers: there is one main road that circles the park like a figure 8 and it is a 2-lane, generally well below 35 mph. It takes about an hour to get from the top of the park to the south end if you drive straight through without stopping and it might take much longer depending on the wildlife. Visitors cause traffic jams by slowing down in the road despite signage everywhere telling you not to do so, just to stare at animals. Most pull off to do their admiring of the wild bison, elk, wolves, bears and massive massive ravens that can unzip backpacks, but a good third just slow down while driving. If that doesn’t congest traffic, the animals can do it themselves: we had several incidents of having to stop to allow various mammals to saunter across the road and once, there was a bison and her adolescent calf walking along the oncoming lane, IN the oncoming lane. The cars behind were stacked up at least 75 deep with more coming every minute so there was a probably 100-car backup before the bison eventually left the tarmac for a side meadow. So plan ahead!  As for the park itself, the sights are mostly amazing. When we visited, the ‘est items were the least so: Grand Prismatic Pool is hard to see since the boardwalk is level with the pool and the steam masks the rest so that was underwhelming. The biggest geyser is right next to it and it is only steaming. The tallest geyser is very unpredictable (Steamboat Geyser) so it mostly just blooped a few feet of water while we were there. But the sulphur cauldron and mud volcano areas were great, the Ledge Geyser in Norris basin was spectacular, huffing constant thick steam like a paper mill funnel, and the Fountain Mud Pots area was very active, with a red spouter constantly going strong and several geysers going while we were there. So there is always something going on, even if it's not the biggest/highest/whateverest.  Restrooms are located at most stops but there were lines at nearly all of them even in this slow off season time. Food is limited to what the various restaurants sell, but there are Yellowstone General Stores at all the big corners and they include a comprehensive grocery, besides gifts and camping gear. Of course prices are rather higher than outside in the world but you’re supporting the park when you buy things in the park.  Because of COVID restrictions, none of the visitors centers or museums were open during this trip except for bathrooms if no others were available for guests on the site."

We drove some 15 hours to get there (spending a night in Idaho Falls) and spent 3 full days at the park. We saw so many different and unique faces of this awesome land in those times. If you could visit only one place in North America, this should be it. We're so happy we finally got the chance to see everything ourselves."
94,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2021 , Couples,"Tyrone, PA ",Spending the day at Yellowstone,"What a fantastic visit for my wife and I. We thoroughly enjoyed spending the entire day traveling through Yellowstone. We saw Buffalos by the hundreds, well over 200 Elk. Grizzly and black bear. The Buffalo walk right down the middle of the road. Amazing way to see wildlife. The scenery is breathtaking and a new adventure awaits at every Corner. The geysers are all unique in their own special way. Seeing something as famous as Old Faithful erupt right before your very eyes is amazing. Be prepared to spend an entire days looking at the wonders which are Yellowstone. This is a definite bucket list trip."

96,Yellowstone_National_Park,Apr 2021 , Couples,"Prosper, TX ",Great time to visit,We decided to visit late April in what appeared to be the off season. Didn’t see any of the lodging open. The only General Store open was at Mammoth Springs. We love still seeing an abundance of snow still on the ground. The only drawback was some of the roads and trails were still closed. The crowd was also at a min. We would get started early and some days we wouldn’t see anyone till about 10:00am. We will be planning another trip in the future.

We toured the west side of Yellowstone on snowmobiles in February. Seeing many scenic views, including geysers. Sharing the groomed trails with Bison, catching a glimpse of some moose, Bald Eagles, coyotes and a fox. Recommend the experience"
98,Yellowstone_National_Park,Apr 2021 , Family,"High Point, NC ",Remember...Roads Are Closed,"After visiting the park many times in the summer, I never thought to check the roads through the park. So when arriving the first week of April, I didn't think to check road openings. So, in essence, the Park was closed. No roads through the park were open, so we made it to the north end and that was it. We'll have to come back in the summer. Very sad."
99,Yellowstone_National_Park,Feb 2021,not available,Seattle ,"Incredible in Winter, a True Wonderland","This was our first time to Yellowstone, and it was incredible in Winter - a true wonderland, with few visitors, so it often felt like we had the place to ourselves. On each of three tours that we took, there were only four of us.    We stayed at Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, all our tours began from the hotel with Xanterra. Our favorite tours were the Norris Geyser Basin and Old Faithful tours, which had amazing stops along the way. What made our tours exceptional was our excellent and fun guide, April, who has been giving Winter tours for at least 5 years.    The snow coach in which we traveled was big, comfortable, huge windows, and heated. It can be below freezing, so dress very warm as if going skiing, and have snow boots.    Yellowstone has over 10,000 water features (geysers, springs, mudpots, and fumaroles). Our tours were breathtakingly beautiful in Winter, and we hope to return, not only again in Winter, but other seasons as well."
100,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2020,not available,"New York City, NY ",Great variety of wildlife and geological settings,"Extremely large and requires a bit of planning to minimize driving. I recommend going from North to South before heading to Grand Teton National Park. Try try try to squeeze in Grand Teton too since it's so close. With geysers, a little patience is required because the times are not exact and the eruptions may be off by as much as 30-40 minutes. Take the advice of all the pamphlets that say go to Lamar Valley either really early or later in the day, the wildlife really do come out during those periods"
101,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,"Richmond, VA ",Incredible Trip!,"Amazing Trip! We spent 4 days in the Park in September (middle) and it was incredible. The beauty of nature and the peacefulness everyone is looking for was found at a few locations. Highly Recommend you see the following if you want to avoid crowds and have nature to yourself. Trout Lake was our #1 Hidden Gem followed by Slough Creek (all the way to the river). Our number 3 was Lamar Valley 2nd Soda Butte Parking (Lamar River Valley Trailhead) go down bank across the bridge over stream and follow path to river --- wow! Our number 4 was Storm Point Loop - follow on your phone app and use map but go down to Lake and through woods = absolutely wonderful. Lastly, and it was breath taking - Fairy Falls.  The Lamar Valley, Trout Lake and Slough Creek were completed in that order. We travelled from Mammoth Springs and got to Lamar Valley early = sun comes up (about 6am in middle of Sept) (best time to see ALL the animals). We went to Trout Lake by 8am and had it all to ourselves and Slough Creek by 11. Slough is steep hike up for first mile so be ready but payoff is amazing. Saw all the other popular sites too and they all are awesome so you cant go wrong with whatever you choose.. We stayed in cabins [Mammaoth Hot Springs and Lake Lodge were impressive] and all were excellent except the Old Faithful Snow Lodge Cabin - the shower water barely ran out of shower head- but still good due to location to Old Faithful. The cabins were nice and quiet and actually better than hotel rooms becuase you were out around nature. The list below is what we would recommend for everyone to see and in no rank order or priorit:  * Grand Prismatic, Midway Geyser Basin  * Fairy Falls  * Old Faithful  * Lamar Valley- 2nd Soda Butte Trail - one past the restrooms -  * Trout Lake- go all around it  * Slough Creek- go to the river  * Norris Geyser Basin  * Grand Canyone Yellowstone - South RIM Trail (Chittenden Bridge to Aritists Point)  * Hayden Valley - see Mud Volcano and go to Nez Perce Ford Picnic Area for lunch down by river – bathroom and picnic tables near river  * Storm Point Loop= amazing views  * West Thumb and Geyser Basin - saw elk here --- also go on Duck Lake Trailhead    Plan time for early mornings and factor in travel time as you will spend some time driving to these site. It is well worth it = Amazing!"

Thanks to our 10 year old it was also free. For those of you with a 4th or 5th grader make sure to apply for your free pass. Also considering it’s so big if possible pick different lodging points for instance spent night in Cody then entered through Cooke City toured the North area and then on to West Yellowstone for the next 2 nights to tour west and southern areas of the park. So much to see and do can’t wait to go back. Bring binoculars or spotting scope and for those of you not bringing a heavy duty camera buy the photoscope for your iPhone, I wish I would have as I saw it in action and just as good as a professional camera. Pack lots of snacks and lunch as really no food opportunities."
106,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,"Two Rivers, WI ",WOW,"We spent two day in the park and wow just too much to relate to in one setting.  first National Park established in 1872, and covers 3,468.4 square miles, comprising lakes, canyons, rivers. Average attendance in previous years has been just a little over 4 million visitors.    Entering the park from the South we went along Lewis valley / lake / river. The area was named after Lewis of Lewis and Clark fame that eventually made the trek up the Missouri across the Top of the US and down the Snake and Columbia River to the Pacific. On their return back east the two explorers split up at the top of the Snake, with Lewis going through Yellowstone.    Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano, but has erupted with tremendous force several times (last was 640,000 years ago) in the last two million years from a magma chamber 3-7 miles down. Half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism (10,000 thermal features of which 300 are glazers). Ancient Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone. When the hot spot blows again is unknown but when it does it will have devastating consequences for all of us even thousands of miles away!    Out both the West and East gates"

Stayed in Livingston which is about a 30 min drive East of the airport. The trek to Yellowstone is about 60 miles south. I highly recommend renting a 4x4 if visiting in late Fall/Winter. We did encounter some icy roads but everything was manageable. You can purchase either a week or annual pass to the park. The week pass costs $38 per car. We did NO research ahead of time but the ranger at the entrance gave us a simple map with landmarks. Very simple to read and we got to see Mammoth, Norris Canyon, the Grand Prizmatic Pools as well as Old Faithful. No words can truly describe how beautiful Yellowstone is! Posted some pics to give you an idea. Yellowstone should be a MUST for any world traveler. Geothermal activity I haven’t seen since Iceland!"
108,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2020,not available,"Louisville, KY ",Poorly Managed,"There are only four entrances into the park. We used the East entrance because it was a hour away from our hotel in Cody. We worked our way from the east entrance, past Old Faithful, and was headed to the Canyon. That way we could just go straight into the East entrance for our exit. We drove all the way to the junction for the north exit/road for the canyon. We get there and the rangers have the road for the canyon blocked saying the East entrance is closed, and that the north entrance is closed as well. There should be a broadcast on their park station saying that entrances/roads are closed. Or at the very least have a ranger stationed at the BEGINNING of the roads that lead to the closed entrances, and tell people that those Entrances are Closed. My family had to use the South entrance which was 7 hours out of the way in the snow. A little heads up that conditions in part of the park were getting bad, and could possibly lead to road closure would’ve been nice. We could’ve cut our sight seeing short and headed back to our hotel. The park is beautiful, it’s worth a visit. Just don’t expect to be informed about anything till the very last minute."

You get a map when you enter and it makes it really easy and organized. If you have an iphone I also recommend downloading the Yellowstone app, it has everything you need for your trip. Just do your research before you go, the cell reception inside the park was terrible.  If you enjoy the outdoors and hiking this is the trip for you. There are easy to moderate to difficult trails. There is something for everyone! And if you just want to drive around and look at the scenery they have simple boardwalks to see the sites and then get back in your car. It’s a very well laid out and organized park."

111,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2020,not available, ,It's a must.,"Even the most mundane is special. We were just driving...just driving south on the loop road early in the morning to go to Old Faithful. It was cold and the river was steaming along with the thermal features...this created a fog like haze over the open meadows with the early morning light. We saw the silhouettes a pack of wolves running in the steam, along a back drop of geysers billowing, on the right side of the road. One of them stopped and howled as the rest of the pack ran off. Off to the left side of the road was a herd of bison, breathing steam in the morning with frost on their backs. I was in awe. Just one of many incredible experiences in YNP. I left Yellowstone prouder to be an American, honest to god. People come from all over the world to see this park. The rangers will tell you ""enjoy your park!"" It is your park, enjoy it in all it's wild glory!"

We were so afraid that the buffalos were going to walk over our car and crush us on the road but the entire herd simply walked past us like we were nothing. They were not afraid and they tend to get really close to you so you can reach your hand out and touch them as they walked by. The hotspings (Old Faithful) is a must-see, along with pretty much everything else. If you’re not hikers, just drive around the area and watch the animals and sights. We spent three days there but others spend a much longer time. This was a wonderful experience for us and something we would do again!"

So much to see and setup very nicely. The views are great and we saw tons of animals. The nature scenery here is great also. The kids loved it and didn't mind the driving that it entails. Only downside is that the food spots were hard to find. I get Covid rules, but how everywhere else can allow dine in but this place will not let you sit anywhere inside, is kind of annoying. We stopped for food and had nowhere to sit with our food. All picnic tables outside were full of course so having to stand there with your food that was all crammed into a paper bag was less than pleasant. Overall though, the park is amazing and we could have spent more time here than we did."

118,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,"Bothell, WA ",The First And Best National Park,"Well I thought Yellowstone NP was a clever alternative to a South African photo safar (cancelled due to COVID) and apparently a lot of other people have thought the same thing.    But despite higher-than-expected September crowds (shouldn't those kids be in [online or in-person] school?) the Grande Dame of America didn't disappoint. Admittedly, lines were shorter than the first time I visited the park (50 years ago) and due to the fires many years ago the trees were a bit smaller but we did see more elk and bison (although not a single bear) than before. The classics didn't disappoint except for, perhaps, Mammoth Falls which has a lot less water flowing over it than before due to earthquakes) but the trails and roads are in much better shape.    Traveling with a pet dog was a bit of a challenge since they're not allowed on the boardwalks or trails so we did do a bit of tag-teaming when it came to hikes and trails (it was way too warm to leave the pooch in the car). But we knew that and had planned accordingly.    Some recommendations: If you want to stay inside the park book your property a year in advance, especially due to COVID. If that's not important, stay in West Yellowstone, it's kind of fun in a rustic sort of way. Plan on at least one major traffic delay due to an animal in the road (keep your day's itinerary flexible with alternatives). Bring a tripod for your camera. A selfie just isn't going to do justice to those backgrounds. Old Faithful is nice, but Yellowstone Falls is better.    Enjoy! This is our national treasure."
119,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2020 , Couples,"Rexburg, ID ",Exciting and relaxed place to visit,"We have been here a couple of times and have always enjoyed our visits here. This time we went to the canyon to see the falls and to go to Yellowstone Lake. We also stopped along the way to look at some mud pools and other sightings. The canyon and lake are officially my favorite destinations on at the park. They were just incredible and very beautiful. If your coming here for the first time then that's the places to visit in my opinion. Just some of the more exciting destinations you can find.    We came in October and becuase the weather was really nice, the park was decently busy. I would not suggest coming in the summer. It was be really hot and extremely busy. Expect delays and traffic jam whenever groupings of people notice wild life. Everyone stops to look at stuff. This trip we saw bison and lots of elk. Were unlucky on seeing wolves and bears on this trip. It was a fun trip! We will definitely keep coming back!"

Old Faithful gets the top billing, but there are many other geysers, springs, and unbelievably cool geological sights.  Yellowstone Lake is magnificent. There are multiple, turnouts for wildlife viewing, trails are well marked, and there are plenty of restroom facilities along the park roads.  This is a very well ran national park.  Pack for any weather as it snowed in early September.  Temperatures ranged from below freezing in the mornings to 80s in afternoon.

Well, we joined the COVID travelers and took advantage of the smaller crowds (which were still bigger than I thought) and hit the park. Just as beautiful as I remember. Still the same stupid people that have to stop in the middle of the road to see the bison and elk. Please, just pull over! Follow the rules! You will see a bison around every corner! Seriously tho, allow yourself time and enjoy this beautiful park. The wildlife, the geysers, the scenery is like nothing else! And if you’re lucky, you will have a celebrity encounter like we did.

122,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,"Alpharetta, GA, ",Great experience!,"We spent four and a half days in the park and felt we were able to see most of the main points of interest.    Comments:  Staying outside the park is more convenient because there are more lodging and dining options. We are glad we stayed at Mammoth Hot Springs Lodge for the experience, but it was not a good value and we had to leave the park to find a decent dinner.    This is an easy park to visit. You can drive to most of major points of interest and reach them easily from the parking areas.    You can visit on your own, and you will probably see wildlife, especially Bison and Elk, but if you want to see some bear and wolves, consider spending some time with a guide because they have the knowledge and experience to get you where you need to be to see the less common animals."

124,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,"Charlevoix, MI ",A once in a lifetime vacation,"The park, itself, if full of adventures to have. There is so much to see, and it is truly fun to see a live Buffalo next to your care on the road. The rangers were nice, but we found that the park rules did not apply all of the time; there is no parking on the side of the road, but when a bear was sighted across a river, the ranger allowed it, so people could watch..it caused daily increased traffic jams. If you want to stay in the park, do your homework on the hotels and areas. My main suggestion is bring in your own food; the food is not only expensive, but could bankrupt an average family."
125,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,"Arlington, VA, ",Exceeded all expectations,"I have visited a dozen national parks, but Yellowstone is in a class of its own. While many national parks are known for a single natural feature - a canyon, a lake, a mountain, etc. - Yellowstone has (1) geysers; (2) hot springs and other geothermal features; (3) a lake created by a volcano; (4) a canyon with waterfalls in different areas of the Park. Any of these by themselves would be worthy of national park designations. And even if Yellowstone had none of these natural features, it also has incredible streams, forests and plains teeming with wildlife, most notably the huge bison and elk that you'll see everywhere in the Park and that would be worth traveling here to see.    Visiting Yellowstone is thus like visiting five national parks, and it is also as big as five national parks. Old Faithful is 30 miles from the West Entrance, the Canyon is 40 miles away and the hot springs are 50 miles away. It would take an entire day just to drive all the main roads in the Park, and you'll need 2-3 days to see the major sites in the Park. It's a worthwhile commitment, though. I pushed myself to see as much as I could because everything I saw was amazing and I didn't want to miss something!"

The park is as big as some small states and there are multiple areas to visit. Get an early start to target visiting one area early in the morning otherwise they will simply run out of parking later. Then have a nice lunch at a picnic area and then attempt another area if you get lucky enough to park. Give yourself 3 - 4 days to see the park, and watch for animals on the road. There were plenty of bison and elk. At the end of season the work crews come out so perhaps there will be some closures. The parking situation is atrocious so just go early and rest later. And don’t be fooled by mileage distance since going 16 miles can take as long as an hour with bad luck. It is a wonderful place to visit and I guess everyone has figured this out!"

The Falls had quite a few people, but Old Faithful was very crowded and only about 10 percent of the people wore masks despite a mask mandate and signs. We spent two days in the park and enjoyed every minute. We ate at the cafeteria at Old Faithful and the food was over priced and just okay. Packed a picnic lunch the second day and sat by a stream to eat.  We entered the park early in the morning and there was little traffic until around noon. Then it got more crowded."
135,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Just Go,"We had to cancel our original trip to Yellowstone that we had scheduled in May. So we planned for this month, rented and RV, and cane running. It was fantastic. We spent four days, which was enough to get the highlights and a few hikes in, but we will be back to see the rest.    A note of caution for RV drivers, though. The hotspots are hard to get parked in. Cars fill up the RV only spots and the shoulders on the road are not always suitable to get parked. There are also a number of parking lots/trail heads/side loops that RVs are prohibited on. We had so much to see that we were ok missing it, although I was disappointed with having to miss Artist Paint Pots because of this. Just make sure that if you are RVing and have must-sees that you can get to them or rent a car. I felt like I had done so much research, but I hadn’t seen anything about parking lots being unsuitable for RVs. Can’t make room where there isn’t any, but still sad that there wasn’t more of a heads up online somewhere.    Masks were hit or miss, but I only felt uncomfortable on the Old Faithful boardwalk. Besides that, people seemed to be giving everyone a wide berth."

137,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,"Sequim, WA ",A Strange Year in Yellowstone,"I first visited Yellowstone National Park almost 70 years ago. I have been back many times since, and seen the park transform through many changes. However, the basic things one sees in the park remain constant and true: the geysers, the many picturesque falls, the wildlife.  One of the biggest changes is the ever increasing crowds. And in 2020, the crowds in September were many times above the average. People tired of being locked down? Children in virtual school? Folks traveling closer to home? Who is to say?  The park experience this September was affected by more than just the crowds. Traffic was very heavy, and parking lots at every attraction and trail head were full to overflowing by mid-morning, causing cars to park along the roadside for long stretches. The overpass at Old Faithful was closed for repair, necessitating a make-shift traffic revision that slowed down access into the Old Faithful area something fierce.  The weather was very much warmer than usual (the past two Septembers we had been met with snow closing all but the Northeast Entrance) and there was prolific smoke from all the wild fires in the Western U.S.  Whether it was the smoke or heat, animals were scarce. In our 5 days in the park, we saw less than a dozen bison (including one right outside our cabin at Old Faithful Lodge) and two elk. Even though elk were in the rut, there was no bugling to be heard. None. We saw one coyote. No bison jams as they wandered down the middle of the road. Most unusual.  Because all the hotel dining rooms were closed (excepting Grant Village), food was only available at a few select eateries, and take-out only. Since the weather was so nice, eating outside was OK, if one could find shade in the middle of the day's heat. Picnic areas were sometimes full as well.  For all the assurances that many steps were taken to make sure the park was sanitized, the public restrooms, even inside lodging buildings, were sadly unkempt and dirty. Admittedly these restrooms were in almost constant use, but they should have been closed periodically for cleaning none the less. They were certainly insistent on using hand sanitizer and wearing masks, but overlooked a key place for germs to be spread....the restrooms.  Not one of our most pleasant visits, to be sure; and the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5. But, despite the pandemic and the fires, it is still a grand old park, and as the T-shirts say, ""Oldest and Best"". I totally agree."

We visited 9/2 - 9/6 during Labor Day weekend and on some days the traffic was insane with lines of cars at the West Entrance.    In Yellowstone NP, you will find the world famous Old Faithful (was a bit disappointing), many other lesser known geysers which did not disappoint, hot springs (Grand Prismatic did NOT disappoint), waterfalls, canyons, mud volcanoes, bisons.

We entered in the North East, after doing the Beartooth Pass, and then headed to Mammoth Springs. In the afternoon we did the Norris Geyser, this was really good, and then headed to Canyon Village and saw the Lower and Upper Falls.  We then did Old Faithful in the last afternoon and following morning. We drove out via Lake Village and headed out to Grand Teton National Park via the South Entrance.  The park needs at least 3 full days if you want to see everything and more if you want to take in some of the great hikes that are available.

Some of the must see attractions are Mammoth, Norris, Grand prismatic, Old Faithful, Mud volcano, West thumb, YS lake, Biscuit Basin, Fountain pot, Firehole lake drive. Dont rush through the park as you will not enjoy or appreciate its beauty. Try to soak in the serene nature around you. Also visit Hayden valley for close encounters with Bison.

First, a day doesn’t do it full justice. We hit a few of the highlights including Old Faithful and West Thumb. Still for a full day of a beautiful road trip Yellowstone was faithful to the spirit of our amazing National Parks. Lake Yellowstone is spectacular. Old Faithful was a bucket list experience. With more time I could have spent a day by the lake and another whole day watching Old Faithful gush on cue. We went in through the West and out through the North. The last leg of the ride to the northern exit was like a roller coaster through spectacular scenery!!! With travel limited thanks to wicked Covid I’ve missed 4 overseas trips this year.

150,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Shakopee, MN ",Recent trip to Yellowstone,"We spent 3 days in Yellowstone. It is a national treasure. I have a couple suggestions. If you use the Yellowstone app, be sure to do it from home. There is little or no cell service in the park and using the Yellowstone app there is non existent or limited.  Also, if the park could post information to tourists arriving that there may be delays getting into the park. 2 out of 3 days we had 30 min delays (we arrived at 9 or 10am at the West Yellowstone entrance) and it gets frustrating to sit for 30 min not knowing why. Maybe it was an accident or construction but knowing there is a delay would help. It is a waste of time and gas to sit idling for so long. It was great to see so many people using masks and/or having them along. Many visitor centers were closed. There was food available in the Old Faithful area and staff did a great job letting small amounts of people in to order. We sat outside to eat. Enjoyed seeing bison, deer and elk."
151,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020,not available,"Morro Bay, CA ","Perfect time to experience this magnificent park, in spite of COVID","Just spent a week at Yellowstone, from Sept. 1-8. What a treasure! It was still crowded, in spite of the COVID pandemic, but at least the international tourists and tour buses were missing. It was particularly busy over the Labor Day weekend. We used the Gypsy app that's available from the National Park Service; highly recommend that you download it as it guides you through the features and history of the park while you are driving.    As far as COVID impact, I recommend bringing in your own lunch and snacks; there are many picnic areas where you can pull over and enjoy the beautiful surroundings. The public eateries in the park are limited, and have long lines. At the popular tourist sites (Old Faithful, Grand Prismatic, Painted Pots, Mammoth Hot Springs, etc.), about 2/3 of visitors are wearing masks; the rest are not. Indoors, everyone wears a mask. If you go to any of the shops in West Yellowstone, Montana, the same is true.    I couldn't say what our favorite spot in Yellowstone was, because everything is just jaw-droppingly breathtaking. Lots of wildlife spotted. There was a bad traffic jam one day because a group of buffalo decided to camp out along the side of the road, and everyone wanted a look, naturally. However, it backed up traffic in several directions for miles. Another day, we saw a herd of elk in the river, including a majestic male, and it slowed down traffic somewhat, but honestly, it was worth the delay. These things are to be expected; it's what we all go to Yellowstone to see.    In spite of COVID, this was a perfect time to visit the park, and to enjoy the outdoors. Can't recommend it enough!!!"

154,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Los Angeles, CA ",Breathtaking - perfect trip for Covid times,"In our first vacation since the pandemic began we decided to venture to one of the largest outdoor areas in the country. So so happy we did.    For those concerned with Covid, we found that more people wore masks and practiced social distancing in a more polite manner than other areas of the country ::cough Orange County cough::...    For the best bison/wolves sightings I would highly suggest Lamar Valley. Bison herds are everywhere so be prepared for some slow downs when the herd decides to start crossing the road.    The Wolfpack we saw was the Junction Beutte Wolfpack near Lamar Valley. The best viewing spot according to locals and experts is on Daves Hill which is at the turnoff for Slough Creek. We also met Rick McIntyre there who is the leading world expert on wolves. (We bought a signed copy of his book, The Rise of Wolf 8 in the town of Silver Gate later that day.)    No luck this year with a bear sighting (just missed a grizzly viewable from Dave’s Hill by about 30 minutes at dawn) but a popular viewing location is Oxbow Bend. Best times are dusk and dawn when the weather is cooler but unfortunately it was a bit warm when we were there and we missed seeing Grizzly #399 and her 4 cubs that were born in the spring of 2020.    The hot springs and thermal features and widely varying landscapes were all stunning. We downloaded the Yellowstone Premium app so we could have access to the information while in the park (non premium access requires WiFi to read about the features and isn’t really helpful when you’re in the park with no signal). We also used the Gypsy app (highly recommend) that uses gps location on your phone and acts as an audio tour guide wherever you go in the park and gives a lot of good information about what sites to visit, how different features were formed, and information about the history of the park and the animals who live there.

The highlight was seeing the female grizzly bear (known as Bear 399) and her four cubs at close range. We spent a grueling but rewarding 4-full days exploring the park’s diverse natural wealth, from the hydrothermal features, geological characteristics and raw beauty to the sparking rivers, lush valleys, dramatic canyons and abundant wildlife. To guide our journey, we followed a 3-day itinerary pulled off the internet. This ensured we would see the most iconic sights. We had plenty of time to explore the many points of interests and stop between destinations when we encountered unanticipated wildlife sightings and other photo opportunities. Fortunately, on our 3rd day we befriended a group of photographers near Jackson Lake who advised us that “Bear 399” and her cubs had been frequenting the area. So, we spent the morning of our last day sitting in our car parked off the side-of-the-road adjacent to the lake praying the bears would appear, and we were not disappointed. As we watched, the bears exited the brush along the lake and crossed the road about 50 feet in front of where we were parked. By this time park rangers had already cordoned-off the road to traffic, but we were already inside the “no access area” allowing us to take unencumbered amazing photos and video of the bears crossing the road.

We only had time to do the south loop, so we were very picky about what we did and did not stop to see. It is doable, but the key is to PLAN everything in advance, to the best you can. Get there as early as possible! By mid-day, the place was insanely crowded and it was difficult to navigate cars through because folks were forces to park on the side of the street as parking lots at various stops were overfull. I highly recommend getting the Yellowstone official app (National Park Services) for help navigating things (be sure to launch the app before you leave your cell service area so it can connect to GPS!). It was a life saver for us. Grand Canon of the Yellowstone, and the waterfalls that tie into it, was the best portion of the trip, for me. It was truly breathtaking!

Gibbons Falls - just off the road  Firehole Falls - one way road -worth it. Nice view at the end of the road, also  Firehole swimming Area (closed)  Fountain Paint Pot & Geyser -I think the geyser went off for over an hour left after 30 minutes  Firehole Lake Drive - drove this twice (always in the evening) hoping to see the wildlife - no that lucky)  Midway Geyser Basin (Hike behind to Fairy falls) - this is a must hike to see the grand prismatic pools properly. Go in the evening to avoid the steam. Seeing it up close is cool but the view up there is great and a MUST DO.  Day 4 – Canyon  Mud Volcano Area - buffalo in the area. Near the Yellowstone river. Great pictures. Get a vidoe of the Dragon's Breath.  Yellowstone Falls Hikes  - Crystal Falls - seen from the south rim across the river - most people miss this  - Brink of the upper falls - just off parking  - Brink of the lower falls (hike down) - it will take your breath away going back up but I saw a 85 year old woman doing it.  - Artist Point - there is a bench here that is great to sit in and enjoy for a while (or over lunch)  - Lookout point - just off parking  - Red Rock Point (Hike) - Was closed  - Uncle Toms Trail - We decided not to take the steep staircase.  - Inspiration Point - nice canyon view just off parking  Virginia Cascades - off the road"

And you need to make the stops. Some are better than others, but you will see things you will not see anywhere else and you will learn a lot. Old Faithful was fun, but several other stops were just as unique and interesting. We missed 1/3 of the park because much was closed due to wildfires, but this was still worth the drive. Wildlife abounds at certain times, but so do the people. It gets crowded and traffic can be very slow. This is not a day trip."
166,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2020,not available, ,A Once In A Lifetime Experience...,"Sadly, I did not get a chance to see a bear or wolves on this trip although, I did hear them howling close to my campsite in the wee hours of the morning. I did see bisons, elks, a deer, and a coyote (in the rear view mirror crossing the back of my vehicle). Contrary to many opinions here, I do believe that the best time to visit the grand canyon (artist point, lower & upper falls) is during the day at around noon when the sun is fully out, which allows you to see the true beauty of the canyons and how the waterfall river really sparkles under sun. This also means having to navigate through crowds and waiting for groups of people to take their selfies at a prime view location near the waterfalls but it is totally worth it because of the infinite majestic photos to be captured.    Every prime visiting location in Yellowstone is like a minimum 30 minutes drive up to 3 hours to get to due to the park's vast landscape and this is with us staying inside the park. Like many others have already mentioned here, plan out your day methodically because you only have some much time while the sun is still out so driving to certain hot spot locations (and back) will take up at least half of your day. We were lucky when we went that the traffic congestion was minimal and there were no animal crossings. If I can change one thing about my trip, I would have spent more time around the Old Faithful area. It may be a tourist trap but the food was delicious and their gift shop carried a lot of beautiful souvenirs."

I'll give some bullets to try to keep this concise.    Buy a Annual National Park pass. $80 and it's good for a year from purchase. There are a lot of NP's in the area and if you are road tripping you will get your value back in one vacation.    Download the Yellowstone National Park App. It has a position active map, audio tours, geyser predictions, road closures etc. Your cell service and GPS WILL NOT work except a few limited areas when you are near park entrances or Old Faithful Inn.    It is crazy busy in the August so get to the most popular spots early or late (5am to 9am or 5pm to 9pm). We saw Old Faithful at 7:43 pm (the last eruption before dark) and it was still standing room only.    Stay as close or in the park as you can. We booked last minute so we stayed in Gardiner which is only 5 minutes from the North entrance but was 1hr and 36 minutes to Old Faithful and that's without stops (which doesn't happen). I've heard to try to stay in different entrance towns for each day but that seemed like a hassle.    Pack your cooler. Fill your gas tank. Bring your sunscreen. There are so many beautiful spots to stop and have lunch a snack or take a hike. Most places were closed due to the Rona and that way you can be self sufficient.    Some people had masks most social distanced. You got to remember you're in the location with the most fresh air you can get. Worry about yourself, not others and enjoy the time you have in the Nations first National Park.    I hope I touched on a few key points and hopefully you google and watch YouTube videos for the rest of your research.

We stayed offsite in Cody to try and save some money and it wasn't worth it. It took near 2 1/2 hours to drive into the park everyday, and it takes hours to get around the park because of how huge it is/how slow you have to drive. The earlier you get there, the better. But even leaving at 5:30, we didn't get to Old Faithful until 8:30 AM. Just keep that in mind.    That being said, Yellowstone is for sure the most unique national park I've been to in the lower 48. I think everyone should see it at least once. The crowds were pretty bad even in late August and it was 50/50 if people were wearing masks. It was also impossible to keep a safe distance at the most popular attractions. My favorite exhibit was the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone."

And I’m not sure if it was because the pandemic or it really was off. We only saw Bison this trip. Which was disappointing. All the restaurants were allowing only take out. Which made it difficult with a family of small kids to just eat where ever we found a spot outside. The lines were awful and things were chaos. But the park was beautiful. The motels were all full. We had prior reservations, so that wasn’t a problem. It was definitely busy. And we will be back in a couple years.😍"

182,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2020 , Family,"Fort Myers, FL ",You Must Visit Before You Die,"Though I will mostly talk about my experience and personal thoughts on this beautiful landscape, this is the objective best park. Other national parks may have more impressive individual landmarks, no parks have more landmarks and diversity than Yellowstone. There are also more activities here than all other parks. With that out of the way, my most recent trip to Yellowstone was amazing. The only thing I didn’t like was that the road to the famed Mount Washburn Trail was closed. However, everything about this park is perfect. I love geothermal features like springs and geysers, and Yellowstone’s are the best in the world. I love how there are also mountains, lakes, valleys, waterfalls, and more to enjoy. Hikes like Fairy Falls and Bunsen Peak are some of the best. The wildlife is also top-notch. Lamar Valley has an overlook where I saw bison, pronghorn, and coyotes all at once. Grand Prismatic Spring is stunning, colorful, and the most breathtaking sight in the park. There is nothing boring in this park and you could spend a month here without running out of things to see and do. Also, one of the coolest things O saw was Old Faithful erupt in the evening when the sun was low, creating a beautiful shadow. You simply have to go here."

As we were checking into our cabin the desk clerk started spouting off the do’s and Don’ts of dogs. Mainly “don’ts”. Don’t leave them in your cabin, don’t lock them in your car, don’t take them on any trails, don’t go into the backwoods with them, don’t take them into any building (except for the cabin, and service dogs can go anywhere). Where can we take them? Inside our car and while on a leash, within 100 ft of any roadway- unless there is wildlife present, then they must stay in the vehicle. So, in other words- just about no where! So, it’s best to just leave them at home. We asked about kennels and there are none.... so basically we’re driving around with our dogs and really can’t do much else. Think about it before bringing your pooch. Sorry to disappoint."

189,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2020 , Family,Michigan ,Awesome Yellowstone Trip despite Covid,"Spent 3 days In the park. Came up through the south entrance through Jackson Hole/Grand Tetons. Jackson was very busy and a long way from the park. We stayed in West Yellowstone at Kelly Inn and has a great stay. Just to know they have limited food options, 1 McDonalds that has non stops lines and closes at 10. 2 grocery stores that are small. They close 9pm. Check out lines are like nothing we have ever seen. 20-30 people deep waiting to check out. The benefit of staying in west Yellowstone and being able to go in and out of the park with ease was the best. Just plan food better than we did. We ordered pizza one night at a local place and it was $24 a pizza. We arrived the 1st night at 530pm and went straight to Hayden valley. We were stopped by a heard of buffalo waking right in front of our car. So close we could touch them! But we didn’t!    The best thing about this park is you can go almost anywhere to hike or swim. Just pull off and away you go. We stopped and had picnics at lake Yellowstone after pulling off and seeing a cool spot and then the next day did the same by Mammoth Springs in the river. Kids loved items it.    We wanted to see a bear but missed one by minutes up close to the road. Bummer!    We did see a pack of wolves feeding on a dead bison. You need spotting scopes or high powered binoccurs to see them. We we were lucky enough to see a wolf cross the road in front of our car while driving Lamar valley.    We initially booked Cody for our stay and I’m glad we switched to west Yellowstone. The drive from Cody to Yellowstone to actually do the loops was almost 2 hrs and they had heavy construction. The drive was beautiful but if you want to me I. The park everyday early Cody is not your option.    Lots of antelope, bison, and bald eagles. We did see a mule deer and female moose. Very cool place to vacation.    We took young kids and could do all of the major attractions at the park. Bathrooms are everywhere which was a blessing. Take hand sanitizer as they are all outhouses."

191,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2020,not available,"Ogden, UT ",A different year,"This is a general review about the park during Covid 19. I have been to the park many, many, times and this is a totally different experience. That being said I want to give my general impression about our experience. It is not your typical experience in the park. All service are very limited. Expect huge crowds at old Faithful, and the geyser area. Not all peopLe are wearing masks. The old faithful inn, the Lake Hotel, all sit down restaurants, and the visitor centers are closed. The options for food are limited, it is all take away, and the lines are long. August is always one of the busiest months in the park, and with so many things closed it makes it a little more challenging. The beauty of the park is the same and some of the less popular areas are not crowded at all. I love staying in the park when things are normal BUT during Covid I would recommend either staying in Gardner, Montana or West Yellowstone where the food options are much better. I would recommend bringing your lunch I to the park and avoid the food service. I think it will be less crowded in September or the first few weeks in October. If you want the true Yellowstone experience I would wait until Covid is under control so you can get the full experience of this wonderful park."

This visit I noticed an absence of large tour bus groups, but an increase in RV's and traffic. Restroom facilities were limited in some areas, with longer waiting in lines. On the up side, the geysers perform as beautifully as ever, and the more you stay away from the popular venues, the more likely you are to enjoy the visit. Grand Prismatic Pool was very crowded, but otherwise we were able to drive around and walk through many beautiful geyser basins. Face masks were worn by the majority of visitors, especially near Old Faithful where it was much more crowded. Take along some extra hand sanitizer, and bring water and food, as the eating venues are not open at present."

There's something for everyone.  The Yellowstone falls are ineradicable to see. The brink hike was cool as it takes you right up above the falls. The roar is intense! Artist's Point is spectacular.  I highly recommend getting up early. The animals come out and you see the most activity at dawn. Hayden Valley and Lamar Valley you're sure to see bison. We saw a bear in Lamar and a wolf in Hayden. Elk all over too.  Wast Thumb Basin was a favorite spot too. Sapphire blue pools alongside Yellowstone lake.  Norris Geyser Basin looks like another planet. Make sure to see Vixen Geyser and Steamboat.  Old Faithful is of course neat to see. There's a lot of other pools and geysers in that area too so take your time here and see everything!  We visited during covid. All visitor centers are closed, all food is to-to and most food in the park is cafeteria type food so don't come with high expectations.  A lot of people don't wear masks in crowd or on trails. I had people looking over my shoulders at a viewpoint, talking with no mask. Most didn't respect boundaries or personal space.

Mammoth Hot Springs would have been prettier if the water were flowing more, but it was still cool to see. Old Faithful was the busiest area we visited. The parking lot was packed. We took our own food to wait for the predicted eruption. We skipped the long lines for food and shopping here and had better luck at the fishing bridge general store. We saw a lot of buffalo, some elk and deer. We didn't see moose until we exited the park at the east exit. Take time to dip your feet in the river and the lake!"

The geysers and hot springs are natural wonders. There are waterfalls and forests that are amazing to see. Interestingly other than buffalo there wasn’t much wildlife to see. That said, even during Covid, when attendance is down, the park remains crowded. Not only is it crowded, the drivers are obnoxious. There are signs all over the place that state do not stop in the road, yet vehicles constantly do. There are numerous pullouts for vehicles, e.g. the largest RVs known to man, to move over to let others go by. Either they don’t understand the role of a pullout or they simply think it doesn’t apply to them but you can be stuck behind a slow-moving vehicle for miles. Vehicles can and will cut you off at any and every opportunity. My personal best was when an oncoming car, when I had a turn signal on that I was going to pull into a viewing area, made a U-turn and cut me off. Trying to view Old Faithful, even in the rain, was an hour-long traffic jam. On the way out, with significantly less traffic, a cruise ship size RV had gone off the road causing another traffic jam. Overall, the most common site in the park is the backside of some massive RV or Trailer."

I know many things are closed down (visitors center, restaurants, campground were closed early June) but we worked around all of these things and had the park to ourselves. We went to Old Faithful right before sunset and it was just a handful of families and a park ranger. Had to leave through the west gate as campgrounds inside the park were closed but we found a hotel and came back early the next day. More people out and about but if you can, get off of the busier boardwalks and in to some of the lesser visited trails and you will have a quieter experience. Find a local photographer and ask about the wildlife. We met a guy that told us where and what time to see a grizzly bear and he was spot on. Bison are everywhere. There is some road construction which rerouted our plans but wasn’t a huge deal. Love this park."

The park is open, and the rangers are wonderful. The sights are spectacular. However, we learned the hard way, you are more or less on your own. The Visitors Centers are all closed. If you would like to eat - BRING FOOD. Yes, there are restaurants open, but not all are. So the restaurants that are open simply cannot handle the crowds. It was awful. And due to road projects around Old Faithful, the traffic jams were worse than normal. Again, the park is beautiful and open, but many activities were closed or prohibited. Check before you go, and bring food with you. Incidentally, even on the way out, the permitter cities were crowded and overrun too. We did not have dinner on Saturday night or breakfast on Sunday morning - because food was not available or lines were overwhelming."

So, it is a full day trip for sure. We entered the south entrance and visited Old Faithful first. Then, we drove a big loop and saw the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, and continued on back to exit on the south again. On the loop back down, there were such beautiful lakes with mountains all around. We saw lots of elk, as well as a black bear. Also, there were lots of bison really near the car. We saw most of this on the way back down to the southern exit. If animals are around, the parked cars will definitely let you know they are there. Huge national park definitely worth seeing."

The hotels and lodges were still close so we stayed at an air bnb in Island Park, ID which is about 30 minutes from the west gate. The park was not crowded so it was a nice experience. We entered the west gate for 2 days and from the Jackson Hole entrance on the third day after visiting Jackson Hole. Our drive from Jackson Hole was great since we saw Bear and a cub and most of the Bisons and deers are most active since it getting dark at that time."
214,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2020 , Couples,"Savannah, GA ",Amazing Park,"We visited mid-July spending 3 and a half days in YNP. We saw major attractions, but this is a huge park with lots of driving so those were very long days with less hiking that we would have liked. If hiking is not your thing then three days is enough. Otherwise you need a week. Bring camera with good optical zoom (we had subcompact Nikon with 20x zoom), and binoculars binoculars or scope. I had small 10x25 scope and it was not enough to look at grizzly and couple of wolves that were far away. It was good enough for bisons and black bears.  There are lots of great attractions other than animal watching in YNP. Our favorites were Grand Canyon of YNP, geysers (we saw 4 erupting with Grand Geyser being most spectacular), Mammoth Hot Springs and Fairy Falls. We stayed two nights in Jackson and two nights in Hotel close to west entrance. Wish we stayed 1 and 3 nights respectively. It’s just too far from Jackson."
215,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2020 , Couples,"Bridgewater, NJ ",Unforgettable,Like no place in the world.

Saw bears, the last 2 days, had a close encounter with one! Plan ahead, know exactly what places within the park your're going to see, depending on how many days you stay. After a while, seeing so many geysers is boring. I had a plan laid out for each of the three days, i included travel time within the park, meals, etc. First day we went to the south part (Old faithful) and part of the central part and along the lake, second day we did the central part (Canyon Village) and norther part (mammoth springs) and the last day we did the 7-mile hole trail, which actually begins at the Glacial Boulder trail and the trailhead has parking available."

River Valleys - This was a suprising favorite of mine...the Hayden Valley IMHO was even better than the Lamar but both outstanding.  2. Canyons - Both Fire hole River Canyon and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone are outstanding. the falls in both areas are beautiful with the falls of the Yellowstone being awe inspiring.  3. Thermal Features - No words...so amazing and otherworldly.  4. Lakes - The largest lake over 7K elevation in North America is vast and beautiful with moutains on each side and thermal features at various spots (love west thumb).    Yes it's big and yes it can get crowded but if you plan well and get lucky with inside the park lodging this is one outstanding NP. Enjoy!

Despite the weather being very cold and snowy for June, it did not disappoint. Because the campgrounds in the park were not open due to Covid-19, we stayed in Wapiti. The drive through the east entrance is very beautiful. Each area of the park is unique and is worthy of spending significant time exploring. I highly recommend you give yourself at least 3-4 days to visit. Also take the time to go out the south exit and visit the Grand Teton's and Jenny Lake ... you won't regret it!"

Day one from Billings had to detour due to bear tooth why with snow- drove towards Cody and then chief Josef why then thru cooke city and Lamar valley onwards to mammoth hot springs since tower to canyon road closed all year. from Norris- Madison on to OFL. stayed there one night. Visited OF, fairy falls trail, grand prismatic, other stops along the way and then to canyon lodge. Drove to Hayden valley and fishing bridge in the evening. Had dinner at Hayden valley roadside. Viewed valley- wolves, elk, birds, etc then back to cabin. Next am fishing at Yellowstone lake, up to mammoth springs onward to Gardiner for whitewater rafting. Then revised Lamar valley, trout lake, pebble creek and back to canyon lodge. Next morning North & south rim roads, Hayden valley and then on to Jackson."

After entering the park, we soon saw a grizzly with cubs. Yellowstone Lake views are majestic. The crowd was small so no traffic along the way. The most disappointing stop was at Mammoth Hot Springs which was about dry. We had never seen the water levels so low. From what I’ve read this is a reoccurring cycle. No tour busses due to COVID!"
229,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2020 , Couples,"Madera, CA ",Majesty of Nature,"Yellowstone is AMAZING!!!! The park has been open for several weeks now, but there aren’t any tour buses. The low population in the park was helpful for us to enjoy the experience. We saw it all...bears, elk, coyote, deer, wolf, swans, and ONE squirrel. We entered from the south, went to Old Faithful, exited to the East towards Cody, Wy, then returned and went out the west entrance. Most major attractions in the park can be viewed without strenuous hiking. It’s designed very well.  Tips: no need to look for wild life. look for tourists going crazy and that’s where you will see the animals...bears are really out there and surprisingly close to the road, get bear spray at a Walmart before entering the park, keep it with you any time you step away from your vehicle...NEVER approach wild animals, EVER, even deer can/will attack."

236,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2020 , Family,"Orlando, FL ",Indescribable!,"I don't know if my title of indescribable is accurate since now I am going to go ahead and try to describe this place. It is literally jaw-dropping. It is one of the most magical places on Earth. There are so many amazing things in this park. It is huge in scale, but at the same time it's amazing so many diverse types of things are so close together on the planet. The animals and geothermal features are breathtaking. I would recommend at least three days to explore by car and more if you want to add in some longer hikes. We ended up driving a few hundred miles through here. I would recommend doing a lot of research before you could hear and trying to plan out a route that makes sense given where you are going to stay and how many days you have. Plan accordingly for food. We were able to go during the Corona virus crisis which according to other travelers we talked to was a blessing because they said they had never seen it so empty at this time of year. We did sadly miss out on some visitor centers due to this but it was worth it in my opinion because there were no crowds."

I regret not having enough time to spend in the park."
238,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2020,not available,Somewhere Usa ,The animals loved the COVID 19 shut down,"The animals loved the park closure. Two days driving through the park and we saw over 30 animal species! It was the most animals we've seen on any of our trips to National Parks. Day one the social distancing was decent on the trails. All the visitors' centers were closed. On the second day, the park had tons of people and very few even tried to follow social distancing, and even less were wearing masks. The stores did have an employee at the designated entrance to only allow limited customers in the stores at a time. Tower to Canyon on the main loop is closed for construction and Fishing Bridge construction continues making for delays. Some parts of the park were still closed off due to COVID 19 restrictions but we were not disappointed in what was available to see. We had a great (but sunburnt) time."

Much larger than I realized, coming in through Cody, spent 12hrs there and STILL didn't see everything!  Some parts got a little busy in late morning-early afternoon, but you can always go back & see it later when it's quieter :)"
240,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2020 , Couples,"Stilwell, KS ",Not what I expect from photos,"We decided to do the southern loop coming into the park from Jackson. First, the Teton NP has a racket on entrance fees. Oh, you want to go through the south Yellowstone entrance? Gotta go through here and get its own permit. So it’ll $35 to enter Teton and another $35 to enter Yellowstone or $80 for an annual NP pass. But I digress. Driving into the park was alot more mountain than I expected. I had these images of bison on the plains that I was expecting. First stop was Old Faithful. It was faithful but I agree that some of the other ones are more impressive. Next we headed to Grand Prismstic. It was such a cold, snowy and sleeting day that the stream made it hard to see all the colors. The most pleasant surprise though was the Grand Canyon. Like why is this not part of the general stuff about Yellowstone? It was incredible! I could have spent hours there exploring the trails. As for wildlife, I also thought animals in the road would be a much bigger issue than it was which was kind of disappointing."
241,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2020 , Couples,"Murfreesboro, TN ",Must Do,"Yellow Stone NP is much larger than I envisioned. Grand Loop takes you through and by most of the “must see” stops and even then you barely scratching the surface the park.    The only complaint I have would be how Yellow Stone handled the sharing of crucial news (as in they didn’t share at all). My husband and I were staying in Cody, WY and the only road in or out of Yellow Stone to Cody is 14/16/20. The East Entrance Road is 27 miles long, up a mountain. There was a forest fire off of 14 near Wapiti, WY. Due to this the East Entrance to the park was closed to any who were trying to use it to exit the park. Instead of communicating this at the base of the Mountain (and prior to drive the 27 miles) they let numerous cars, trucks, RVs, 5th Wheels, etc make the trek to the East Entrance exit and then had them turn around to drive the 27 miles down the Mountain and then drive half the loop to get to the NE entrance of the park.    The real cynical person in me thinks that was so tourist had to pay the $2.70 per gallon of gas at their gas station.    In all seriousness, Yellow Stone is beautiful and if you’re in the area then a must see. There just needed to be a way to communicate gate closures."

To do all the park needs a more central base and a lot more time. The views and wildlife are stunning. We were there in the first week of October, which was unfortunate as many of the Visitor Centres close on 30th September"

We always stop and eat at Soda Butte restaurant at Cooke City. Next we travel through the park to West Yellowstone and stay the night. Get up early the next morning to hope we hear the elk bugle which we have been lucky to hear. Then to old faithful and the other sights. Then we are off to Jackson Hole. Hope everybody can have this experience. You won't regret it. My wife's lifelong dream was to stay at the old lodge at old faithful. It was fulfilled in 2002. Plan ahead to book a room there.

250,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Albuquerque, NM, ",Huge and Amazing,"OK, Yellowstone is great, beautiful, awesome and a true national treasure. I couldn’t help but think about the fact that it is also a super volcano overdue to explode, but that’s another story. The park is huge, gorgeous, diverse. Rolling grasslands, beautiful canyons and waterfalls, amazing volcanic fumaroles, vents and lakes, beautiful Yellowstone Lake, and of course the wildlife. We did the routine touristy thing, came in from West Yellowstone in a line of cars, saw buffalo and snapped photos. Watched Old Faithful blow its top along with perhaps 300 other people; it wasn’t that crowded on this early September day. Good facilities around Old Faithful (gas, food, lodging). Had a pretty decent lunch snack at the Lake Yellowstone Hotel and admired the Upper Falls from Artist Point. Admittedly, with only a day to see whatever we had time for, we barely scratched the surface of this great park. But I have to say, after Yosemite, Glacier and the Grand Canyon, this park seems...well, underwhelming, I guess, is the word. I’m VERY glad it is a national park, but not sure I understand why it was the first one. To me, those other parks are just grander and more awe inspiring. Anyway, it is a bucket list attraction and we didn’t have enough time to see it all."

We started into Yellowstone on a foggy, rainy Saturday. It was so foggy the visitor center recommended a different entrance. By the time we reached the park a steady rain was falling. As we drove to upper elevations the rain changed to snow, thick globs of snow were falling. It was beautiful, but we had to take it easy. We didn’t cover as much of the park that day and with it being so wet, we pretty much drove & stopped at scenic areas.    The following Monday we came up through the Grand Tetons and we covered more of the southern part of the park including Old Faithful. The traffic was noticeably less and the weather allowed us to be outside:). We learned the main highway going through the park is not plowed in the winter and winter comes early and stays late in that region. We all felt fortunate to enjoy the park and would definitely return."

This low cost app follows your GPS, pointing out areas of interest you might otherwise miss and giving a history of the park. Don't miss Lamar Valley and the bison, and you should be able to view plenty of elk, the occasional moose and if you're lucky, a bear.

The next day the Park closed all the roads into the Park. Registered -32 degrees on the dash thermometer but we persevered and got some great photographs. Bison, wolves, otters, big horn, coyote, eagles and out of this world landscapes."

Day 1: EWR to SLC. Visited Temple Square. Shopped at Harmons Grocery for Utah honey, Apple Beer and Real Salt as souvenirs.  Day 2: Left hotel by 8:30am. Drove through Logan Canyon (Rt. 89) to Garden City for Bear Lake photo op and Hometown Drive-in’s raspberry shakes and lunch (it's the only one opened on Sunday). Stopped by Afton for a picture with the antler arch. Then Albertsons Supermarket in Jackson Hole for food supplies before going into Grand Teton. After checking in at Colter Bay Village, we went back to Jackson Hole to walk around and had dinner at Snake River Brewing.  Day 3: Arrived Jenny Lake Visitor Center by 8am to get tokens for the Inspiration Point hike (ranger program).  Only 25 tokens were given out first come first serve, but we saw people tagging along here and there throughout the hike.  Marvelous hike to see the lake, waterfall, and panoramic views. Ate brown bag lunch at Inspiration Point and then continued to hike the Cascade Canyon on our own.  Saw a super fat marmot sun bathing on a rock.  Some hikers reported they saw a moose, but we didn't see it.  Returned the same route back down to the lake because there was no bathroom and kids were tired. Ate dinner at Cafe Court Pizzeria by our cabin and walked around. Saw a fox and a few deer. Lots of mosquitoes after sundown.  Day 4: Heading to Yellowstone. Saw two grizzly bears crossing on Hwy 191. Arrived West Thumb Visitor Station for 10am Ranger Program. Very informative. Grant Village General Store for a quick salad/burger lunch. Artist Point and South Rim Trail in the afternoon.  Evening car ride in Hayden Valley. Lots of bison. Stayed at Canyon Lodge and Cabins.  Day 5: Mud Volcano Ramble Ranger Program at 10am. Saw a bison walking onto the boardwalk and rangers had to re-direct visitors and closed certain sections. Pretty neat.  Kids did not like the sulfur smell in the whole area, but adults didn't care. Lunched at Canyon Lodge Eatery. So many choices, but food was bland.  Norris Geyser Basin area in the early afternoon.  Drove to Roosevelt Lodge Dining Room because park rangers highly recommend the route.  Views were breathtaking indeed. Dinner at Roosevelt Lodge Dining Room. Great food, but expensive.  Drove to Lamar Valley. A must see. Even more wild animals than Hayden Valley. Saw a lot of bison calves besides adult bison, and pronghorn antelopes. Stayed at Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel & Cabins. Neat cabins, very small bathrooms, and many ground squirrels running around outside.  Elks were everywhere at dusk in front of the hotel lobby.  Day 6: Hot Springs Terrace Walk Ranger Program at 9am. Boiling River was kids' favorite part of the whole trip.  So special that they are still talking about it after 6 months. Headed to Old Faithful area after lunch.  Saw bison walking next to cars, and grizzly bears and black bears strolling along Rt. 89. Stopped by Firehole Canyon for swim. Lots of cars and people, but floating down with the current was fun. Stayed at Old Faithful Lodge Frontier Cabin.  Day 7: Geyser Hill Walk Ranger Program at 8:30am. Very windy and chilly that early. Summer temperature returned at 10am. Copied down the geyser eruption time in the visitor center and did the Old Faithful Ttrail. Saw Castle Geyser and Lion Geyser eruption. Morning Glory Pool was very green that day. Fairy Falls Trail for the overlook of Grand Prismatic in the afternoon.  Day 8: Heading back home.  What I learned: Make a donation to Yellowstone Forever to receive a membership card. The card will get you 15% off for purchases made in the Yellowstone General Stores, which sell souvenirs, breakfast and even coffee, and there are multiple stores throughout the park."

I would suggest staying in two different areas of the park. We stayed at Old Faithful Inn for two nights, there is a lot to see in this area. The Old Faithful Geyser is a short walk from the historic Inn. If you follow the board walk you can walk to see Morning Glory Pool. We had accommodations for one night at Canyon Lodge and Cabins.

283,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Wickenburg, AZ, ",Doesn't compare to any other NP,"No need really to describe Yellowstone. Everybody know this is where you go to see geysirs, buffalo, all the geothermal activity. But it is a truly overwhelming place; it should be on everybody's bucket list. Yellowstone doesn't compare to any other area anywhere, it is truly unique. Stunning, breathtaking, amazing ... nobody who goes there will be disappointed. Be prepared for cold nights and spells of winter weather though - even if it isn't winter."

I saw a dozen Elk at the Roosevent Arch entrance and mostly at Mammoth Springs. I saw about half a dozen male Bison one at a time, and I saw a herd of maybe 15 bison in Hayden Valley. This was September 2019; so maybe they all went south for the winter?"

It was peaceful, relaxing and visually stunning. The natural landscape in Yellowstone is truely stunning. An awl inspiring trip. Highly recommended and certainly worth a visit to see a true example of the worlds natural beauty."
286,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2019,not available,"Huntington Beach, CA, ",Never Enough Time,"We thought we could do the park in three days. We plotted our north entrance start with visits to Mammoth Hot Springs then Tower/Roosevelt. Oops, the road from Tower to Canyon Village was closed for road repairs. Skip Lamar Valley and head to Norris Geyser Basin instead.    And so it went. The best laid plans of mice and men were stymied by road closures and snow in late October. The first real snow fall also meant we saw very little wildlife. A herd of elk in the distance but the rut was over. The bison were bedding down on the hill, not close to the road. No pronghorn antelope. No wolves, No grizzly bears.    This is nature. You have to be prepared for changes to your itinerary. I know we will go back. From what little we were able to do in one day I know there is so much more to see. Everyone should experience this national park in their lifetime."
287,Yellowstone_National_Park,May 2019,not available, ,Staying in Park & what to expect & when to go,"We have been to Yellowstone twice both times for 3 weeks. Travelling from the UK we fly into Jackson Hole which is about 70 miles south of Yellowstone park, stay one night in Jackson Hole which is a lovely town and ski resort. Advantage of coming into Jackson is you can hire a car easliy and get to travel though the Teton National Park and Rockefeller National Park. Staying in Park is a must but you will need to book the accomodation at least 12 monthes in advance. The cost of accomodation varies a lot depending on type and site (between about $50 - $300 per night), Grant village is the first area with accomodation south end of park and is reasonably priced but quite bland. If you travel clockwise (we travel around all the park and have stayed in all locations) next site in the Old Faithful Inn highly recommend staying at least a night in this wonderful wooden Inn and of course see the dependable Geyser that is Old Faithful. Travelling on Mammoth Springs has a Hotel and cabins recommend the cabins they don't have bathrooms but a communal toilet and shower block but are lovely. Roosevelt is the next area we would highly recommend the rustic cabins are the cheapest accommodation in the Park and have old fashioned stiove heaters, a black bear and cubs wandered by whilst we stayed there. Yellowstone Grand Canyon is a must see the cabins here used to be the cheapest but were all replaced with modern cabins and now quite expensive. Finally Yellowstone Lake the colonial hotel is wonderfully but there are cheaper cabins to stay in and you can just eat and drink in the hotel . If you go earlier in the year (end of May is when the accommodation and roads open) there will be bigger crowds but better chance of seeing Bears as later in year they move to higher ground. You will definitely see Bison as you drive around also Elk, Bears, Springhorn, Coyote and Osprey. You may also see Moose and Wolves. So bring a decent camera and a pair of binocules also stop the car and get out and walk and you will leave the crowds behind. If you do walk I recommend getting Bear spray (about $45-$50) I have both visits never used it but good to know you have it, hand it to the Rangers when you leave and they give it to scout groups. If going later in the year take trunks and go for a paddle in the boiling river near Mammoth Springs it is where a a hot spring and the river Gardiner merge, earlier in the year the river is running to fast so is closed. I would also highly recommend the cowboy cookout trip from Roosevelt which is either via horseback (not allowed to take phones or camera on the journey handed back at cookout) or covered wagon, to a steak cookout meal and some tall cowboy stories and songs."
288,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2019,not available,"Llanidloes, UK ",STAY IN PARK IF YOU CAN,"We drove from Denver, stayed overnight on way and entered Yellowstone via Grand Teton. We had booked to stay in Cody that night so only covered the South of the Park but saw Old Faithfull. Drove out East exit and on to Cody (50 miles) and the thought of driving back the next day to cover the North was not attractive so didn't bother. Next time I would pay the extra and stay in the park accomodations - that would cut travelling down as you have a fair bit of travelling in the park. Beautiful views and well worth the trip."
289,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Valhalla, NY, ",Beautiful Park,"This is a beautiful park to visit. Of course there are going to be crowds and during peak season at the best spots there are going to be really big crowds.    I went in mid September so the crowds weren't that big though in some places, Old Faithful in the middle of the Day, Grand Canyon of Yellowstone they were still quite busy. We stopped at Mammoth Springs , Yellowstone Lake, Pristmatic Springs, Grand Canon of the Yellowstone, Mid Geyser Basin and Gobbons Falls amongst others. Only spent 2 days in the park could have easily spent a week or more. Staying the in park is really helpful as on the second day we were out early and the crowds weren't that bad."
290,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Hamburg, NY ",GET UP EARLY,This park has some very interesting features but we hate crowds and we hate traffic and this has both. Basically there is one road going around a big loop and then up north and south. And lots of tourists. We did stay in the park for one night (I don't know about you but $350 for one night is not cool!) and got up very early to watch the sun rise in the canyon. Very beautiful but buses were already coming (just go off on a short path to get rid of people). Then we went to Hayden valley and saw HUNDREDS of buffalo in and around us!!! Awesome!!! We could park and watch. Had we arrived 15 minutes later we would have been stuck in traffic and seen nothing!!!! NOTE: there is a hot spring in the park just as ou enter the north end (we didn't realize till it was too late) We went to hot springs in Chico and that was very nice

I am writing a book titled ‘Barbed Wire In The Land of Eagles’ and I ache to visit both Cody and Yellowstone again.. Heart Mountain in Cody was Holy to the Crow Indians and the top of the mountain is upside down likely due to a massive volcanic eruption that lifted the mountain thus the top twirled and fell upside down."

He guided us to places where we observed wolves interacting, elk, mountain goats, prong horned antelope, pic and more. He has deep knowledge and years of experience in Yellowstone, its history, the wildlife and geology of the Park. So when we viewed Mammoth Hot Springs or the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, MacNeil gave us detailed explanation of the geology of these areas, the colors in the water and how the landscape was formed over time. This was a terrific experience. If you plan to visit Yellowstone McNeil Lyons will offer a breathtaking and memorable experience. Five stars ***** Highly recommend."

Then again, you have weather to contend with. We were there October 17-20 and got caught in a snowstorm that closed ALL roads in and out of Yellowstone. This was cool because we had rooms at the Snow Lodge so we were happy to be stuck in such a beautiful place. We will return!"
303,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2019 , Couples,"Epping, NH ",Trip Report: Yellowstone and Grand Tetons 10/1/19-10/7/19,"We drove from NH to Yellowstone towing our 27 ft camper. It took about three and half days of driving (3 12 hour days and a half day) to West Yellowstone. The drive was overall uneventful until we hit snow in Montana and Wyoming, which slowed us down a bit but we were expecting snow so we’re not surprised. We arrived at Grizzly Campground in West Yellowstone and were greeted by very friendly staff. Our site was right near the main building and had no privacy but we weren’t planning on being at the campground that often. We were a five min drive through town to the entrance to the park.  The afternoon of our arrival at YNP we decided to drive into the park and explore a bit. This was around 4pm. We drove into the park and within five minutes we were surrounded by bison on the road 😳. I had seen this in pictures but never expected to experience it! Since we were there in the end of the busy season/beginning of the off season, the crowds were minimal. There was traffic but nothing like what I had expected. We continued our drive through the park for another hour and saw hundreds of bison, some elk, and some fox. I couldn’t believe how much wildlife we saw!  We spent a few nights a Grizzly Campground in which it snowed every day. It was chilly but being from NH and doing our research had prepared us for the cold weather and snowy conditions. We went to Grand Prismatic Spring, Old Faithful and the Old Faithful Inn, drove through the Lamar Valley, relaxed in the hot springs of the boiling river in Mammoth Hot Springs, did a few hikes, saw a Grizzly, wolves, coyotes, bison, and elk. It was an AMAZING few days. Due to the snow storms there were some roads that were closed in the park early in the day so we planned our itinerary around that, but the roads were open by mid day.  We ate out one night but it was nothing to write home about.  We did end up at a small camera shop in town to buy a better lens for my Nikon SLR after seeing all the wildlife on the first day- the owner of the shop sold us a great lens with no markup that we had expected in a tourist town (he brought up the lens online and showed us the price). That was a great experience.  We drove to the Grand Tetons next and stayed at Gros Ventre Campground for a few nights. We had no hookups here but we did have a generator. We chose this campground due to its reputation of high moose sightings/activity. The afternoon that we arrived we went to the river in the other side of the campground from our site around 7 pm and saw two moose right away! That night it got around 9 degrees. The next day we went to Jenny Lake and did some hiking, then drove the scenic road, went through Mormon row, etc. We were leaving the next morning and as we were driving out (around 8 am) there were seven moose in the field of the campground. It was absolutely amazing to watch these animals!"

Yellowstone NP is huge, I drove about 90 miles within the park to visit some of the areas (Madison River, Artists Paintpots, Norris Geyser Basin, Canyon Village, Yellowstone River, Mud Volcano, Lake Village). All these areas were very beautiful, with some outstanding views, even if I had no luck in spotting wildlife such as bisons.  About mid-afternoon it started snowing, so I decided to exit the park and visit the rest the following day. It took me 3 hours 30 minutes to drive from Lake Village to Jackson (a little less than 100 miles).  The following day I did not re-enter Yellowstone NP - it was cloudy in Jackson, but snowing in Yellowstone, and I did not want to risk 3.5 + 3.5 hors of driving!  Make sure to check weather forecasts a couple of days before visiting Yellowstone!"

It is such an amazing spectacle. Also all of the other features of the park just must be seen. I would stay at Old Faithful Inn or Cabins in that area because it is near the most famous geyser and also I think the best, most central location to see both loops. We used GyPSy Guide GPS system through our phones for our tour guide and I know we saw more than bus tours. I recommend that you pull off at every opportunity because there is something unique about every vista. We could not believe how much Geo thermal activity is there. And for goodness sakes- hang on to your pets and children as it is as dangerous as it is beautiful here. Follow all the rules and stay on the walkways. Go early am or at dusk to see the most animals."

The third day we took a trip more around the flat land area and seen tons of Buffalo very beautiful animals they roam free so you have to be careful. As a family trip with me and my two teenage kids we were very pleased and loved the outdoors I would recommend anyone go to Yellowstone it will be a trip like no other
315,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Huddersfield, UK ",Not as good as I expected,Despite the title of my review I did greatly enjoy the experience but it was slightly let down by the vast amount of road works taking place especially around the Fishing Bridge area which took away one hour from my sightseeing plans. It is a great spectacle with many photo opportunities that can add a considerable amount of time to your plans along with the traffic delays when an animal appears in shot and however much time you allot to spending in the park it can never really be enough. I was disappointed to have to pay to lots of 35 dollars to drive through Grand Teton & Yellowstone especially as I am a solo traveller but I know that Americans love their national parks so do not have a problem contributing to their upkeep. I am not sure I will ever make the trip again from the UK but I am glad I have experienced it though I still maintain that it did not have the Wow factor that I was perhaps wrongly expecting.

Crowds are definitely smaller, but you risk having plans interrupted due to roads closing when it snows. We were blessed to have everything work out, but snow was an issue several days.

I'm not joking on this room expense."
318,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2019,not available,"Park Ridge, IL ",Yellowstone Lower Loop in a day,We drove up early from Jackson and was able to see so much in just day. The geysers were great - highly recommend seeing castle geyser. We then headed to see Grand Prismatic. We actually parked at Fairy Falls and walked an easy trail to the overlook to get great views. The Grand Canyon of Yellowstone is also a must - such amazing views. We checked it out from both sides. Saw a lot of wildlife when driving from one stop to the next.
319,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Sydney, Australia ",Beautiful,"I think firstly you need to stay in the park so you don't have the driving in or out everyday on top of the driving within the park. It doesn't really matter where you stay in the park but it is obviously busier if you stay around Old Faithful. Don't let that put you off especially if you go before/after summer. We stayed in September and although there were people around, you weren't pushing and shoving at all and not crowded on the elevated boardwalks. Yellowstone is a beautiful place and I think seeing the animals makes it. Even if you don't want to drive the whole park, I think you'd still need at least 2-3 days to enjoy the main attractions."

323,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2019,not available,"Houston, TX ",Crowded even in off-season,"The grandeur of Yellowstone was somehow lost on me. We drove the ""Grand Loop"" on Oct 1, 2019, entering the southern park entrance at about 8:30am. We exited the same gate at about 3 pm. We stopped at Old Faithful, Grand Prismatic Springs, Artists Pots, and one other famous attaction, and stopped to view/photo wildlife at least 5 X. We spent the most time at Old Faithful and enjoyed walking around on the elevated board walk seeing the other smaller geysers and thermal springs more than actually seeing the big guy errupt, which we saw twice. Parking was ample but there were several tour buses of Chinese tourists who made up quite a crowd. Every other place we stopped (other than on side of the road to see bison) the parking lots were full or nearly full and the walkways crowded. I can only imagine how utterly frustrated I would have been having to see it during the peak season with its crowds. I guess the biggest disappointment was that the park just wasnt that impressive from a mountain/scenery perspective. Topography was much more rolling plains, or dense pine forest you couldn't see thru from the road. Grand Teton Nat'l Park was SO MUCH more impressive! I would advise people that didnt have time to spend at least a whole day or two in EACH park (Yellowston + Grand Teton), skip Yellowstone and spend your time in the uncrowded, much more beautiful Grand Teton park, where you will see a much greater variety of wildlife, impressive mountains, and trails to fit any desire."

You will see natural wonders like you have never seen anywhere in the world. It is easy to spend several days in the park taking time to stop and see the wonders. There are great places to stay and eat if you wish to stay in the park. Lots of places to stop and have your lunch if you take your own. We visited in September and again in early October. Spring and fall are good times to visit since the crowds are gone. Be sure and check to make sure roads are open. Fall is very beautiful. There is so much beauty to see in and around the Yellowstone Ecosystem and your vacation will refresh and relax you. Be prepared for cooler weather than most of the country."
325,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2019 , Family,"Williamsburg, ",Best of all National Parks!,"Our visit to Yellowstone was phenomenal. We stayed at the KOA west of the Park, which was a bit longer drive in than we anticipated.  I recommend downloading the app, which gives you eruption times, maps and other helpful info.  Day 1, we saw Old Faithful, paint pots and other features in that part of the Park. The Junior Ranger program had a fee but was very interesting and informative. My 9 year old could tell us the temperatures of the hydrolic features and calculated he next eruption of Old Faithful.  Day 2, we took a morning hike, in an attempt to see animals but only saw a bald eagle, an elk, and several bison. We also saw Mammoth Geyser and drove around the center of the Park.  Day 3, we decided we would get up at 5 to see animals. We were not disappointed! On the way through the Park, a mountain liin crossed our path. Up in a hill, people with spotting scopes helped us see wolves and their cubs. Nearby was a cinnamon bear. Father down the road, we saw yet another bear! And of course we saw hundreds of bison!"
326,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,Westfield ,"Majestic mountains,geysers, and beautiful animals",Went to Yellowstone last week of September- there was a bit of snow and icy roads at night from a massive storm in northern Rockies but that did not deter us from marveling at the wonderful scenery in the park. The mountains from the east entrance were amazing- beautiful and majestic by themselves but accented by beautiful surroundings. The southern loop revealed interesting geysers including Old Faithful. The Inn at the geyser is magnificent- should go there just to see the decor. Didn’t see that much wildlife except for a moose and a couple of herds of bison but the experience of being in one of our nation’s natural wonders was clearly worthwhile.
327,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Springfield, MA ",Magnificent Treasure,"Yellowstone was on our bucket list for years so we were excited to finally be there. Nothing I write here will ever do it justice. The Park is beyond amazing!    We passed through Grand Teton and entered at the South Entrance, going immediately to Old Faithful. Our guide had checked the time schedule and we had just enough time to walk down to the benches, find seats, and watch the eruption. We were instructed to grab a lunch at the facility above so we got sandwiches, sat at a window and were fortunate to see the next eruption.    The Park is large and one could easily spend a few days here. Our next stops were the Upper, Midway and Lower Geyser Basins. An interesting place was at the Lower Basin where there was an eerie scene of dead bare tree trunks sitting in a white muddy area, the bottoms of the trunks being white. Great stark photo op!This is also the starting point for a half-mile boardwalk called Fountain Paint Pots Trail. Here you will see mudpots, hot springs and fumeroles, and possibly one or more of the geysers erupting. It is one of the most dynamic hydrothermal areas in the Park.    Another favorite stop was Artist Point at the Lower Falls (over near Canyon Village). They refer to this as the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. The canyon colors are beautiful and cameras were clicking, but walk down a way until you get to the stairway. From that corner there is a great view of the waterfalls spilling down into the Yellowstone River. How fortunate we are to have this amazing, beautiful Park. Enjoy!!"

So much to see and do and while we spend 4 days in the park, there is so much more to do like all the day hikes, Bechler region etc. which we didn't have time to explore. A really amazing adventure!"
329,Yellowstone_National_Park,Oct 2019,not available,"Denver, CO ",Amazing,We visited Yellowstone the first week of October and it was fantastic. The temperature was cool and there was a dusting of snow but there were also no crowds. We stayed at the Lake Hotel which was very comfortable and the lobby had the feel of a very grand hotel. In the mornings we enjoyed watching the wild life and the sunrise over the lake from the lobby. Yellowstone is one place I would recommend everyone to visit.

But, what we were able to stop and see was really nice! Well worth seeing!! Was my first visit."
333,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,United States ,A MUST DO!,This was a first time for me and won't be the last time. EXPANSIVE park. So much to see. Make at least a day for each section of the park that you want to see. Be prepared for some hiking and elevation challenges. Pictures don't do it justice. Main roads are plenty wide for large campers etc. Just be sensible when driving and pay attention to signs that recommend size of vehicles. Don't be a dumb butt and ignore the signs. Not only will you ruin your day but others as well.

336,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Lake Ridge, VA ",GyPSy Guide - Made our Yellowstone/Grand Teton Trip,"We recently came back from an amazing trip in September of Yellowstone and Grand Tetons. I had read a TON of reviews before going and a couple people mentioned that the GyPSy guide (app you download on your phone for about $10) made their trip. I was so glad we read the reviews, and downloaded the app. There is no basically phone service in Yellowstone or Grand Teton's, so using a GPS to get you from place to place in the park won’t work. Somehow this app worked. It knew exactly where we were at all times. It was amazing. We named it ""Ted"" and soon did not want to dive anywhere without it.    The GyPSy Guide would tell you that a stop was coming up and whether it was worth exploring, or if there was a better look out a little later. The app shared history about the parks and animals. It really took the stress out of navigating (especially since you'd be only using a paper map otherwise). Well worth the investment! It worked for both parks (Yellowstone and Grand Tetons).    There is so much to do in the park, whether it is a waterfall to check out or volcano feature, or a pull off with a beautiful view. For planners, like myself, it can be overwhelming if you are trying to figure out how to navigate the park, and how much time it will take to complete activities on your own. The app made it easy. It would explain how long stops would take, etc. Most of the main attractions are right off the road, so you do not need to ""hike"" unless you are looking to do that.    We flew in and out of Jackson Hole, WY (the airport is in Grand Teton National Park). We stayed our first night at the Elk Country Inn about 20 minutes away from the airport in Jackson Hole (town). The town was cute and worth a night to check out. I'd recommend eating at Liberty Burger, while in Jackson Hole. I'd brought a backpack cooler, packed in my suitcase. We stopped off at a grocery store (Albertson's) in Jackson Hole (there is also a liquor store in the same shopping center) and picked up bagels and sandwiches. So we'd have breakfast and lunch covered while in Yellowstone.    We reserved a minivan, which was helpful so each of our 4 adults would have bucket seats and we had plenty of room for luggage. This trip is a LOT of driving with frequent stops (stopping about every 15-30 minutes). There is a lot to see in the parks. A comfortable ride is important.    We drove the next day through the Grand Teton's to Yellowstone (which is about 1.5 hours north of Jackson Hole). Yellowstone Park is in the shape of the number 8. It costs about $80 for a week's access to both parks.    We had our best weather on the first two days, so we arranged our visit based on the weather. We visited the Old Faithful area (bottom left of the 8) first when we entered the park from the south. We had a full day of sightseeing exploring that side of the park, and stayed that night (and the next two nights - total of 3 nights) in Canyon Lodge. Canyon Lodge is in a great location (middle of the figure 8), however it does not have a TV, microwave, AC, or internet, and rooms are expensive and the food in the restaurants there was pretty terrible. Some people opt to say outside the park in West Yellowstone to have these amenities and less cost, but the traffic to get in to Yellowstone in the morning, and out of Yellowstone in the evening is SIGNIFICANT.    The 2nd day, since we still had good weather, we headed north, starting from Canyon Lodge (middle of the figure 8) and stayed on the right side. During this day, we explored Hayden Valley (saw buffalo, grizzly bears, black bears), exited the park to Gardiner, Montana and took pictures next to the Roosevelt Arch. Then we headed back into Yellowstone and explored the features in the Mammoth area (north part of the 8) (there are frequent Elk in town), and then headed south on the west side back to the middle of the figure 8 back to Canyon Lodge. We completed the full top circle of the 8 in one day. It was action packed.    The 3rd day it rained. :( We were not interested in exploring the park in the rain, so we headed out of the park to West Yellowstone. It is about an hour drive from Canyon to the town of West Yellowstone. Our plan was to watch a movie and have a good meal. The movie theater only had 3 movies playing and was sold out. (Buy tickets early if it's raining.) We ate at Wild West Pizzeria which was REALLY good. We drove about a half hour west to a park in Idaho. We figured we'd check Idaho off the state list, since we may never visit there otherwise.    On the next day we checked out of Canyon Lodge. There were a couple of things to see right near Canyon Lodge (Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, etc) which we did, then made our way south. We ate lunch at Lake Yellowstone (which is a beautiful hotel and lunch was great, but expensive) then completed the final bottom right portion of the figure 8, and continued South and explored the east (right) side of the Grand Tetons Park (Grand Tetons park is kind of in an oval shape). That night, and for the next 2 additional nights (3 nights total) we stayed in an Airbnb in Wilson. Wilson is about 15 minutes south of the Grand Tetons. It was nice to have space, a full kitchen, living room, bedrooms, laundry, etc.    The next day we packed our picnic lunch and drove about 40 minutes north to Jenny Lake in the Grand Tetons. We took a boat ride across the lake ($10 pp), then hiked to the waterfalls and to Inspiration Point. Inspiration Point is where we had our picnic and saw the amazing view of the lake on one side and the Grand Tetons Mountains on the other. It was REALLY nice! The pictures were amazing. Then we hiked back to the car. The hike back to the van was a bit strenuous, with more hills than I had expected. We also drove a short distance north to the Jackson Lake Lodge. You can have drinks on the back deck of the hotel. The view was really nice. (This is NOT a great view for a sunset though).    The next day we explored the Laurance Rockeffeller Preserve and Phelps Lake which were about 15 minutes north of Wilson (off Moose Wilson Road). It was a fairly strenuous hike to the lake, but also beautiful. You can do a loop, so you don't have to repeat your steps. It took us about 2.5 hours.    In Wilson, we found another great pizza place, called Calico. It was really busy, you may want to order to go.    It was a great trip. We saw a lot of animals. Amazing time! Hope you have a great trip."
337,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available, ,it is amazing,"this is the first time we were here, after many years of hearing how wonderful it is etc. We flew in to Bozeman airport and rent a car, because of restriction of time. Our experience was much better than what we heard from friends,partly was because we were lucky, had wonderful weather during our 5 days stay. we saw all the attractions and a lot of wild animals, even lucky enough, we spotted a Grizzly bear, and took wonderful picture of it. we down loaded GypSy Guide, as suggested by a friend. It is wonderful app, easy to use, and very informative. This is the first time we went to Yellow stone. without out GypSy Guide, I am sure our trip would much less enjoyable.

340,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jun 2019,not available,"Kellyville, OK, ",Amazing,"This is one of my favorite national parks, I've been here 3 times. There is history, wildlife, and amazing scenery here. Don't try to see the park in 1 or 2 days. To see it properly takes at least 5 days because there is so much to see and do. The park is broken into sections - Lake, Old Faithful, Madison/Norris, Mammoth, Tower/Roosevelt, and Canyon. I recommend spending 1 day at each area and exploring. To avoid the crowds go early in the day or later in the day.    If you spot wildlife, be considerate and pull completely off the road. We were stuck in so many bear and bison jams and people would just stop in the middle of the road (sometimes bison would be in the road so cars couldn't move). They would also get too close to the bears and spoil it for anyone else trying to get a glimpse.    Lodging inside the park can be costly (cost us about $2000 for 6 nights at Canyon Lodge) but is convenient for exploring.    Take a drive out to the Lamar Valley and watch for grizzly bears, bison, elk and pronghorn. Ask people stopped along the way what they are looking at/for. Many times you can see wildlife you wouldn't normally spot. We saw a grizzly sow with cubs several times. At the end of Lamar Valley, near the northwest entrance, we saw a black bear eating a moose carcass.    Do get out and explore the more popular parts of the park but take time to check out the hidden gems - Duck Lake, Yellowstone Lake Overlook, Clearwater Springs, Frying Pan Spring, Nymph Lake, Beryl Spring, Terrace Spring.    Be prepared for any kind of weather. We enjoyed mostly warm days but our last night in the park, it started snowing. We woke the next morning to about 5 inches of snow (June 8, 2019). Most ways out of the park were closed. The West Entrance and Mammoth (I think) were the only ways out.    I definitely recommend a visit to this great national park."

346,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available, ,Lamar Valley Wildlife Tour,"When it comes to looking for wildlife in Yellowstone’s Lamar Valley there are no guarantees. The first time I tried I had limited success. I stopped my car where other cars and vans had stopped and saw a fair bit of wildlife e.g., buffalos, pronghorn deer, and more. But I was disappointed at what I had not seen e.g., bear, wolves, etc. So, on my next visit to the park, and after a thorough review of Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews, my wife and I commissioned Yellowstone Guidelines for a private tour. Oh, what a difference it made! They had the right equipment (spotting scopes and radio transmitters) and experienced staff necessary to maximize the potential for seeing wildlife. Our guide, Cayley, not only knew where to look for the animals but she also knew all about the wildlife. We saw, and heard all about, deer, bull elk, grizzlies (including one guarding a kill and a mother and cub), a black bear, a red fox, 8-9 wolves (grey and black) trying to get their kill back from the first grizzly, pronghorn deer, a badger, a huge herd of buffalo, and mountain goats. Cayley not only knew about the animals; she also knew a lot about the plants and geology of the region. Our private tour also included snacks and a wonderful lunch. I would highly recommend Yellowstone Guidelines for your tour of the Lamar Valley."

In fact, I think I will come back and do just that."
351,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2019,not available, ,The most well maintained National Park I've ever seen,"The Yellowstone National Park sits on a super-volcano. God knows when it will erupt again because it is an active volcanic site where subterranean heat of magma is being continuously transferred to the surface and vented thru a huge numbers of geysers, fumaroles, hot springs and mudpots.  About 631 thousand years ago there was a huge volcanic eruption here creating a giant caldera of 30 by 45 mile in dimension. The park has a rich ecosystems ranging from arid vegetation, which you'll find at the north entrance to sub-alpine meadow and forest Mount Washburn. They support a variety of habitats where thrive diverse wildlife like bison, elk deer, grizzly and black bears, pronghorn deer, gray wolves, Canadian goose, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Not only wildlife, many native American tribes still have a deep-rooted connections here. You will wonder as you will explore them.  Animals are seldom seen in the dense, dark forest that covers most part of the park, Rather they are more easily seen in open meadows, shallow pools & rivers where you'll get ample opportunities to watch and photograph them. There are several adventure packages and expeditions available e.g. you may go for Winter Wolf Discovery package. In winter, very interesting are snow coaches ploughing through a feet deep snow with their oversize tires (4 ft tall and 3 ft wide).  The Park is divided into three loops with wide, asphalt paths, so that you can drive and reach upto the walking distance of all major geothermal activities. A life time Adventure that never dies."

357,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,Bowling Green ,Worthy of First National park status,"Yellowstone is a national park that cannot possibly be covered in one, two or even three days. My wife and I made our second trip to YNP, spending 4 1/2 days and still left some areas unseen or unhiked. Please, if you plan to visit Yellowstone, allow a minimum of 4 days, preferably a week. It takes at least a couple days to see all the sites at the Old Faithful area, alone. It can't be stated emphatically enough about how much wonder mother nature provides in this park in the way of geysers, thermal activity, water falls, hiking, wildlife, forests and scenic drives.  The only major downside is that the park is so loved that traffic is often unbearably slow and backed up at certain times of the day. Often, tourist drivers stop in the middle of the road to view/photograph bison, elk or the rare bear completing ignoring driver sensibility that they pull to the side of road and allow traffic to flow past them. Please be a good tourist and obey speed limits, pull to the side of the road when viewing wildlife and park in responsible parking areas. Always plan for delays and be patient in your travel plans because you can't control the traffic and multiple personalities that visit Yellowstone (example: traffic back up for miles due to a couple of women walking in the middle of the road photographing the landscape, completely oblivious to the traffic backup and potential for personal harm that they caused).  Yellowstone is a wonderful treasure but increasing traffic and tourist irresponsibility make it quite a challenge to enjoy."

All the sites, drives and walks are worth the visit--but you will run into the lack of parking at these spots so you might have to come back a second time to get the opportunity to see them. Noris Basin is one of these sites. The best place to see the buffalo herds is on the northeast entrance road. The elk hang out around the north park entrance in Gardiner and at Mammoth Springs. The speed limit is 45 MPH but driving slowly lets you enjoy the wonderful vistas and the wildlife that pops up unexpectedly. There are special drives that do NOT allow access by buses, RVS, campers so please be aware of that as you do your planning. Food and bathroom breaks can present a challenge, too. Only at the major lodges do you find true bathrooms.Take your sandwiches and drinks as the lines can be long and you don't want to waste time waiting. Enjoy this special place because you will want to return as there is so much to see."
361,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available, ,Nature at its best,"The millions of acres that comprise Yellowstone National Park are a true treasure. From the over 700 geo-thermal features, to the grand canyon, to the Yellowstone Lake to the wildlife. WOW! we spent 4 1/2 days soaking in the natural beauty. Suggestion: take a Yellow bus tour which needs to be booked well in advance. Also, remember that the locations of the Inns/Lodges and main tourist areas can be 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours apart; plan accordingly. We made dinner reservations at The Lake Dining Room which was 1.5 hours from where we are staying at Old Faithful. We canceled because the drive would have been late at night."
362,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Baltimore, MD ",Drive — and be amazed,"The vista’s, the wildlife, the knowledgable rangers and tour guides, the nature, the hot springs, the geysers are worth the driving you have to do to get from place to place. Hikes for all levels, short, long, arduous and easy. Only a few jerky people getting too close to the animals. No litter - lots of consorting and recycling. No internet or cell reception - so plan accordingly."
363,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019 , Couples,"High River, Canada ",Definitely gorgeous,It’s totally beautiful & geysers need to be experienced. Be prepared for ugly traffic & tons of people even in mid September
364,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,Michigan ,"Experience the park, stay in it!","We stayed in the park - 2 nights in Mammoth, 2 nights in Old Faithful, 2 nights in Lake and 1 night in Canyon - this enabled us to experience the various areas and minimize drving. Hot Springs, Lamar Valley, geysers, Old Faithful, Yellowstone Lake, Grand Canyon of Yellowstone (North and South Rims), Hayden Valley, Dunraven Pass and all the sights along the way. We stayed in the lodges versus cabins and our accomodations were great, though pricey. Our dining experience was also very good with the exception of Canyon area - only a small restaurant for dinner and cafeteria style service for breakfast and lunch which was a 10 minute walk or a bus ride - not convenient or relaxing. We saw elk in Mammoth, pronghorns in Lamar Valley and bison the valleys, at Old Faithful, and Lake. The Rangers were helpful and informative. Most people were respectful of the wildlife and nature - sadly, a few were not. Cell and Internet services are limited, but we were there to experience the park, so ""unplugging"" was not an issue. We were prepared with layers of clothing and rain gear. We enjoyed our time in Yellowstone."
365,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2019,not available,"Verona, Italy ",for visiting all the park you have to spent four days,"The park is very big.

366,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019 , Family,"Northville, MI ",Epic but Beware,"Went to Yellowstone in September with my family for our first trip. The overall experience was positive, but there are some cautions for visitors. First, the sight are amazing - the geysers, the landscape and the animals. However, Yellowstone is HUGE, very spartan accommodations and can be quite dangerous. The park is massive and you need to allow a lot of time driving around.    The roads are good, but there a lot of foreign visitors, poor drivers, on single lane roads. Most of the sights are not close to each other.    The driving can also be very dangerous. We drove through the park to Lamar Valley and also out the East entrance. It was treacherous driving up and down winding mountain roads with steep drop offs a foot off the road with no guardrail in many areas. I would never drive at night or in any kind of bad weather.    The other caution is about the accommodations. We stayed at the best and newest lodges in the park according to many - the snow lodge and canyons lodge. The accommodations were very basic - no TV, no WiFi, poor or no food options. Overall very limited and very expensive. You are paying for the location. We thought the lodging was 2 stars at a 5 star price."
367,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Trinity, TX ",Magnificent,"Every road, every corner, every turnout your breath is taken away. Lots of people. Lots of vehicles! Many traffic jambs! If you can endure these, the sights will payoff!"
368,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2019 , Business,"Yekaterinburg, Russia, ",A geyser wonderland,"There are more than 300 famous geysers included among the hydrothermal wonders of Yellowstone National Park. There are lots to things to see and do in the park, such as going for walks on the boardwalks adjacent to geysers, camping, learning about the microbes living in the extremely hot waters, and more."
369,Yellowstone_National_Park,Aug 2019,not available,"Milwaukee, WI ",Do your research,"It ain't cheap unless you camp, and bears are dangerous. We didn't encounter the crows we expected, but hiking alone really is problematic and in many areas trails are marked with recent bear activity, so solo hikes are out. You do have to make an effort to get out of the car, and you should, but know even short walks can be uphill. I was with a partner who had trouble with the altitude and difficulty with all these activities. The landscape is full of mountains and lakes and is beautiful, though the flora aren't that varied (no deciduous trees, only pines)"
370,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Greyabbey, UK ",Variations at every point,"Spent today doing the lower loop and can’t believe how much variety there is every few miles. From Forrest’s to mountains and then to geysers and canyons waterfalls to cascades, all dramatic different and awesome.  We were greeted by a few bison just a few miles into the park, but sadly still no 🐻. Heading back tomorrow to do the upper loop so hopefully will have something to report then"
371,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Baldwin, NY ",like no other place on earth,"I have been to many paces,and you just cant compare what you see in this park to anything else.Lamar valley is just loaded with buffalo,mammoth springs is so beautiful and elk are all over the property standing very close to the sidewalks for great pictures,basins,gysers,hot spring pools spewing steam all over,i mean its almost like your not on earth.I REALLY loved the old faitful in, must go for the tour that is free and learn all about the place which is fascinating from any angle you look.Old faithful can be seen from up close or the second floor of the INN from outside which a lot of people do.Great little gift shops throughout the park.My advise is the best time of year to go is a week after labor day. No long lines through the park unless there is an animal sighted then everyone stops,and you can see everything you want without trying to find parking.It was a pleasure this time of year! One thing is that MOST areas of interest involve lots of walking up and down stairs and its very hard if your not in good shape.I was so out of breath and after a while lost interest in seeing some things because my calfs where on fire and I was physically exhausted"
372,Yellowstone_National_Park,Jul 2019,not available,saint louis. mo ,Beautiful and Handicap Accessible!,"We only had one day at Yellowstone so we explored the lower loop. We also have a child in a wheelchair so we stuck to the areas that have boardwalks or paved walkways and drove ourselves. We arrived at 7am to beat the crowds and traffic wasn't bad at all. We saw a bear in the road almost immediately after entering the Madison area - it was the highlight of the trip for the kids! Our first stop was the Canyon Village Visitor Center for an animal program (we did make a few photo detours along the way). The ranger gave us lots of great info to start out our trip. As we drove through Hayden Valley we saw a giant herd of Bison and some Elk grazing. The mud volcano area was cool, but a little crowded. We stopped in Fishing Bridge for lunch (bison burger and elk sausage). The food was good and the prices were about what you would expect in a tourist area. West Thumb basin was one of our favorite stops. The boys found a shady spot and took a quick nap in the car while the girls attended a ranger program. Then we met up and strolled the entire area. There was a lot to see, colorful paintpots, beautiful teal springs, and interesting lake cones. Our next stop was Old Faithful. We got lucky and arrived just before it was scheduled to erupt. I was a little underwhelmed. Of all the things we saw, it was probably the least impressive and by far the most crowded. We had some ice cream and took a quick break for souveniers at this stop. The kids showed their ranger books and got their badges here as well. Our last stop was the Grand Prismatic Spring. By this time it was almost 6pm and we were pretty tired, so we almost skipped it. SO GLAD WE DIDN'T. This is a must see. It was absolutely beautiful! On our way out of the park we saw pronghorn drinking from the stream. Overall, our one day sampler itenerary gave us a little taste of everything in the park and was perfect for someone with limited mobility. It was a long day but definitely doable. Of all the national parks we have visited, this was one of our favorites!"
373,Yellowstone_National_Park,Sep 2019,not available,"Nashua, NH ","Worth a visit, no matter the length of time","This is an iconic National Park so it is certainly well worth the time to visit at least once in your life. The variety of things to do and see in the park vary as much as the landscape and you can find something for everyone. Overall the park has a fair blend of amusement park-like amenities and nature/wilderness. You can certainly find at least a few things you'll enjoy and you don't have to break into wilderness mode to enjoy it. If you really want to see the entire park you will have to give yourself 4 to 5 days to do it in a non-rushed manner. If you only have a few days, I would still think you just go and do what you can so you can see the park and it's glory while it is still around."
