0,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2021,not available,"Athens, GA ",Surprisingly hard hike this time of year!,"Due to recent snow fall and melting snow streams, this hike was much more than we expected. We are not experts by any stretch, but lost the trail numerous times because of snow covering it. We had to cross lots of water and hike through very deep snow as we got higher. It took us four hours to get to the top and we were ever so thankful for a gondola ride back down."
1,Rendezvous-Mountain,Apr 2021,not available, ,Get the beginner pass if you're learning & save big,"Great opportunities for beginners with a gondola to the bunny hill, saving a newbie from the terror of the ski lift. The beginner hill has a magic carpet to get your footing before venturing out. Many of the magic carpet operators will offer tips to those learning too. The lift operators were amazing. Buy the beginner pass to the lower mountain & save big. Watch out though. The local travel agency, Jackson Hole Central Booking, won't tell you about this savings and will just charge for a regular pass. The regular pass to this mountain is extremely expensive. $177 the day we were there vs. $54. If you buy your lift tickets through Central Booking, they won't give you a refund within 7 days either. So you might be best off getting your lift ticket directly from the mountain if you're a beginner."
2,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2020,not available,"Jonesboro, GA ",Winter 2020,Was not able to go to the top of the mountain due to Covid-19. At lunch at the Mange Moose and had a great burger.
3,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2020,not available,"Austin, TX ","Advanced mountain, good for experienced skiers and snowboarders","Had a great time skiing here this weekend. Staff was friendly, everyone was wearing masks and obeying the Covid protocols. Glad we didn't bring the kids because there were very few green runs for beginners. Excellent for my husband and I - even had some fresh snow on day 2! Will definitely be back!"
4,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2020,not available, ,Impressive,"This area and the views are impressive, no matter who you are and where you have been before. Good place to see."
5,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2020 , Couples, ,Hiked from Gondola,Great views. Tram closed in 2020. Rode gondola and hiked up Rendezvous Peak. Strenuous hike. You can take road for a less extreme incline. Went slow. Spent 5 hours. Took a picnic lunch we enjoyed on the deck at the closed Corbett’s Cabin.
6,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2020,not available,"Oceanside, CA ","OMG - FANTASTIC VACAY RENTAL, OUTSTANDINGLY GREAT EXPERIENCE!!! THUMBS UP ALL THE WAY!!!","EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS! Way above and beyond what we imagined. Absolutely wonderful location, amenities galore in our unit, C#3 Nez Perce and RM Vacay Rental Co left us a nice welcome package of hand sanitizer, mask and other goodies. I don't ever want to stay in a hotel again...they've spoiled our lodging expectations and now it's RM all the way when we go to Jackson which is usually at least once a year. RM made the experience easy, happy and user friendly. Way to go RM Rentals...super WELL DONE!"
7,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2020,not available, ,Beautful views from gondola!,"In summer, gondola is free after 5pm on certain nights of the week. We were staying at Teton Village, but this mountain has cool hiking and views - lots of mountain bikers too, so you have to watch out."
8,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2020,not available,"Houston, TX ",Great Views!,"We rode the Bridger Gondola up as the aerial tram is closed for maintenance this summer. You can save $7 by buying tickets on line in advance. Or ride after 5:00 p.m. when its free. The views are spectacular from the top. There are a couple of restaurants where you can pick up something to eat or have a drink. The Deck at Piste is a great spot to chill and take in the view while having a drink on the outdoor patio. The Piste Mountain Bistro offers table service dinner. We didn't dine at either, but its worth checking out. We did some hiking on the trails near the top which provided some stunning views. The air is thin, so beware if you're out of shape."
9,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2020,not available, ,Great place to ski!,Loved all of Jackson Hole. Wish I had the stamina of my youth and could do the Black Diamonds without breathing hard.
10,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2020 , Friends,"South Australia, Australia ",Definitely not just for skiers! Unbelievable views! Do it!,"Skiing from the top of the tramway at Jackson Hole Resort is not for faint hearted & they say as you step off, that you definitely need to be experienced to tackle it. However, we did not go for that! We wanted the awe inspiring view. So we chose a clear day. We were lucky there was an ‘inversion’ - warmer on the mountain top than in the valley. We bought return tickets (roughly $35) and joined the queue for the tram with a myriad of eager skiers. The tram takes around 100 people jammed into the carriage. The trip up therefore was cramped but rapid. At the top, the skiers dispersed quickly. We had plenty of freedom between trams to take in the amazing views...as spectacular as I’ve seen anywhere in the world, including Switzerland and Scandinavia! There is a small cafe where you can get a snack eg waffles and Irish coffee! There is a deck to stand outside if you wish - seating is limited. The return trip only had about 8 people in the tram, so we delighted in clicking away with our cameras again! The views from the summit are unparalleled though and I’d definitely suggest this is a must do activity in Jackson. It certainly gave perspective to everything else we saw."
11,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2019,not available, ,Awesome Trip,"Love this area, great skiing, cute town, and wonderful public transportation. It is a tough mountain to ski, so it might be too much for beginner skiers."
12,Rendezvous-Mountain,Oct 2019,not available,"Clarence, NY ",Try the Wonderful Waffles in the Small Restaurant at the Summit!,"Take the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain at the Teton Village ... a ""must do"" while visiting the Jackson Hole area any time of year. The view is spectacular. And for those of us who aren't skiers, the thought of skiing down the mountain is terrifying! Try the great waffles .. they are delicious."
13,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2019,not available,"South Lake Tahoe, CA, ",GREAT VIEWS,"We choose the Gondola, but you can also take the Tram...both leave from Jackson Hole Teton Village Lodge area...or you can climb up...."
14,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2019,not available,"Cape Girardeau, MO ",Great views,A huge tram takes you to the top ($31 senior). The 360 degree view is spectacular. From there you can walk down by the treacherous 3-miles long Cirque trail to the gondola. From there you can take the gondola to the parking lot. Be very careful or else you could tumble down to deep ravines.
15,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2019,not available,"Arlington Heights, IL ",Amazing Views,"We took the tram up on our last day in Jackson Hole. It's worth the trip up there - fantastic views of the valley and the Tetons! Definitely grab a waffle from Corbet's as well. They are delicious and the staff up there are great! We did not have enough time to hike around, but I'm sure that would be beautiful as well."
16,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2019,not available, ,Beautiful view of Grand Tetons!,"Gorgeous ride up on the ariel tram. Go ahead and have a waffle at Corbets. You won,t be sorry. Beautiful at the top as well. There are many trails to choose from if you are an avid hiker. However, I am from Ilinois and the altitude of 10,000 feet takes some getting used to. I would recommend."
17,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2019,not available,"Philadelphia, PA ",Great Summer Hike from the Summit,"My girlfriend and I took the tram up to the summit on a warm August day, which was a fun experience in and of itself. 43 degrees at the top, even in August, so bring a sweatshirt. The summit is a worthwhile experience with incredible views of the valley and other peaks. We took the Cirque Trail to the Wildflower trail all the way down to the tram starting point, 7.2 miles of switchbacks, wildflowers and amazing views all the way down. You can make a pit stop at the gondola station, rest, refuel, and use the bathrooms. There's a swing attached to one of the trees on the way down which made for a nice break and photo op. Trails are well marked, so it's good for beginner or novice hikers. Obviously pack plenty of water, oxygen boosters (if you're not used to the altitude,) and comfortable hiking shoes. Don't kid yourself, coming down from 10,000+ feet has it's own unique challenges. If you're like us, you'll be worn out and starving by the time you reach the bottom. Great, memorable hike. Definitely coming back to Teton Village."
18,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2019,not available, ,Great Views,"Took the tram up. It is absolutely breathtaking from up here Would definitely recommend the trip, and consider getting the waffles while you are up there."
19,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019,not available,"Oviedo, FL ",Cool place,"We took the tram up and has waffles at the resturant on top. We explored the area, did shrt hikes. We took some outsiding photos. It is worth the trip up and down, you may see some wldlife, we did."
20,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2019,not available, ,Beautiful views.,"We spent an afternoon at Teton Village and rode the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. It’s about a 10 minute ride up and has incredible views! The operators are knowledgeable and happy to answer questions. Be prepared for wind and cool temps at the top even in August. We took our time, did the whole ‘eat a waffle at the top’ thing, and completely enjoyed ourselves. The trams runs every 15 minutes so getting back down was easy once we were ready to leave. We were here in August so there weren’t the kinds of crowds seen in winter months."
21,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019,not available,"Convoy, OH ",Beautiful Views!,"I loved this. Our tram guide back down was super cool and informative. The tram ride to the top wasn't too long, and beautiful. We took a lot of pictures, took a path, and of course ate waffles. I could've done without the waffles, but it was an experience. The wrist band was also good for the gondola, so we did that too while there. We didn't do anything but quickly look around there because out youngest was too small for the rock climbing, but the ride was still cool."
22,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Family,"Harrison, AR ",Waffles and wildflowers,We rode the tram up for the tourist aspect but loved the sweet treat of waffles from Corbitt's Cabin then walked/hiked looking at all the flowers. So beautiful even at these heights.
23,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Mill Hall, PA ",Breathtaking!,"If you want to be in awe, take the tram up to Rendezvous Mountain! Go early - not many people go up in the morning and it's like you're the only one there! Many many photo opps and so very breathtaking. Speaking of which, I was a bit concerned about trying to breathe so high up (almost 11k feet above sea level) but I was fine. Only got a little out of breath when trying to walk and talk while going up a hill.    Also dress warmly, even though it was a warm 80+ degrees at the bottom, it was a chilly and windy 45 on top!    Along with the fantastic views, there's a most excellent waffle shop. Hubby had the strawberry waffle but I highly recommend the lemon one! Coffee, soda, water, beer and wine also sold and there is an outside deck to sit and enjoy your treat.    Some reviews complain about the cost but for us, it was so worth it. How often do you get the opportunity to stand on a tall peak and see the world? Just do it!"
24,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Henderson, NV, ",Almost The Top Of The Tetons,"In the summer you can take the tram ride up here, in the winter you can ski down. Even mountain bike it if you like. If it's a summer or off season thing you're doing, consider doing a bit of walking up here. Just meander around and then tram it down or you can follow one of the trails for a bit of time downhill to get you to the gondola stop for your trip back to the base. There are better dining opportunities by the gondola. But Rendezvous has 360 views and a waffle type convenience counter. the aroma is pervasive. There's even an outdoor deck."
25,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Nice ride up with Gondola,It was a bit pricey at $44 but if you use the two additional rides you get with it (go early enough in the day to do so). Its a nice area to spend the day
26,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Family,"New Canaan, United States ",Rendezvous Mountain is breathtaking,"Your breath will be taken away as you soar to the top of the mountain, more than 10,000 feet above sea level. The views are almost unbelievable as you can see more than 80 miles in all directions on a clear day. Like a fantasy, so beautiful.    The other reason that it will be breath-taking is that you will be almost two miles above sea level, and the air will be quite thin. But is so worth it."
27,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Family,"Parkland, FL ",Dinner at Mountain top,"Visited the restaurant on our first day in town. You must take the gondola(free) to the restaurant. Always cooler there so dress accordingly. Dinner was good, but service needed some work. Overall expensive but you are paying for the location."
28,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fayetteville, AR ",Gorgeous Summer views and tasty waffles at Corbett's,"Gorgeous views but you can quickly view this in between the two tram rides and grab a waffle to go (15 minutes) so if you don't want to pay the Tram fees, it is free to ride up at 5 pm but last tram down is at 5:30. Fortunately I stayed at the Teton Club through our timeshare and my husband and I (as owners) received a card for a free tram or gondola ride up. It was a gorgeous view but I'm not sure it is worth $40 to ride up and take the views in.  You can also ride Gondola up and either take a steep hike over to the top of tram or walk the summer access road which is fairly flat."
29,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Amazing views and great village,"We were visiting the Grand Teatons and staying in Jackson. This was a 20 minute drive to this resort. When we left we went in a back way to the teatons over a rough road.    Wow what great views! We got the tram pass on a warm (base 80 degrees) clear day in early July. After purchasing the tram ticket we learned it was good for all 3 teams that were operating this summer. We went up to the top of the large tram summoning over 10,000 feet. We could all fee the altitude in our breathing. Colbert’s cabin offered fun and yummy waffles. This is a great spot for pictures. We were able to watch paragliders fly off the mountain here as well. (JHPG) we decided to hike but many of the trails still had lots of snow and that wasn’t our kinda hiking. We took the rim trail to the summer hill trail which was about 2.2 miles mostly down hill on a wide service road with the last 1/4 mile being a steep uphill to a cool base camp with a smaller (8 person) tram down to the bottom of the hill. There are many cool activities at the bottom of the hill from free corn hole to paid zip line corse. There are also many places to eat from fancy to taco truck (really!). We ate at the Mangy Moose which had great views (we sat outside) and yummy food! Get som truffle fries which are big enough to share with the whole table:). ***buy tram tickets online and save $$$***"
30,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Coggeshall, UK ",Must do.,This is a great half day. We took the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain where there are spectacular views. We then walked a couple of miles along to the Gondsls to ride down taking a break for drinks on the terrace by the restaurant.
31,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fort Wayne, IN ",Take the tram to the top.,My family loved this. Even my wife who is afraid of heights fought through her fear. The view from the top makes it all worth it!
32,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2019 , Family,"College Station, TX ",The view,"Take the tram, take the gondola, take your feet . . . just go. The scenery at the top is outstanding. Go."
33,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2019 , Couples, ,Awesome views,"Overall, this ended up being a fun experience. It didn't start out that way due to the ticket sales person being rude to my husband and refusing to honor a veteran's discount for him. However, I made a phone call after our visit and we received an apology plus a refund. The lady I spoke with was very nice and helpful. We really appreciated her efforts to ""make it right"" with us. The trip itself was awesome! At times, it seemed like you could reach out and touch the mountainside as the tram traveled up the cables. There is a recording of information to listen to as you go up the mountain; I enjoyed that. Once at the top, the views are amazing! It was cold and windy up there so regardless of the time of year, you probably need a jacket or coat. There is a waffle house at the top, Corbins Cabin, where you can get a snack or drink. Don't expect anything healthy though, just carbs and bacon. I would recommend this aerial tram ride while in Jackson Hole."
34,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2019 , Family,"Abilene, Texas, United States ",Amazing views from the top,"Our family thoroughly enjoyed the view from the top of the mountain. It was a fun little hike around the crown and you can see for a long way. There was snow to play in too, even though it was a gorgeous summer day. I will mention that for my mother, who is nearly 80, it was a little tough because there was very little seating when you get up there. She wanted to sit while she waited for us to do our hike. There are a few benches but it is limited for sure."
35,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Shelby, IA ",Yellowstone Trip,"Took the tram up this mountain to 10,450 ft! Fabulous view of Grand Teton Mountain! Worth the cost of $20 per person. Had waffles at the little shack on top. However, though the waffles were not worth the cost, the experience itself was. Definitely recommend this site."
36,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2019 , Family,Philadelphia ,Fun day on Rendezvous,"Our family took the tram up to Rendezvous Mountain and hiked the trails at the summit. A good two hour hike on the trails, and stop at Corbet's Cabin for beverages."
37,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Dodge City, KS ",wonderful views,I enjoyed the ski lift ride (we saw a bear). It was not ski season but the view was wonderful. Above the year round snow line so there was snow despite the summer travel.
38,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2019 , Family,"Topeka, KS ",Incredible view of Jackson Hole and Teton Mountains,"We rode the aerial tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain and the view was spectacular. Bring extra layers and plan to spend a little more time (and $) at the top to buy a waffle and a hot drink. It was a fun treat for the whole family. We only saw a few deer from the tram, but the conductor said on average they see a moose every few days and a bear every two weeks or so."
39,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2019 , Couples,"St. Johns, FL ",Wonderful views!,We did not know this was in Jackson Hole but we were so glad we found it! What an amazing tram ride with wonderful views at the top. I recommend this to everyone!
40,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2019 , Family,"Charlotte, NC, ",Aerial Tram,"We rode the aerial tram to the top and got the 10,000 ft view of the Jackson area and it was quite spectacular. Bring a jacket, it's breezy up there!"
41,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2019 , Family,"Orlando, FL ",Breathtaking view!,"After the tram ride, we climbed the snow to the top of the mountain to see 360 degrees of amazing views. We hiked and played in the snow for about three hours."
42,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2019 , Family,"Rockwall, United States ",Beautilful and thrilling,"Gorgeous view of the Tetons and Jackson from the summit. Great waffles at Corbet's Cabin at the top, too!"
43,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2019 , Couples,"Newton, NJ ",Great Waffles!,Had to wait out some high winds at Corbet's Cabin Waffles - but what a great place to wait. Waffles and beverages were as great as the view and the company!
44,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2019 , Family,"Pocatello, ID ",Best in all the West,"St. Patrick's Day weekend was sunny, Goldilocks snow -- just right. A moose was grazing in an aspen grove at the bottom. The top of the tram wasn't windy. Wonderful place to sky. From the airport to a downtown hotel is fast. Hotel shuttles take you to the mountain. Wonderful restaurants in walking distance from downtown hotel. Wonderful place for spring skiing."
45,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2019 , Friends,"Utica, NY ",Great skiing,I love skiing Jackson Hole. Great conditions and a wonderful mountain to ski. Plenty of choices for an all around experience!
46,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2019 , Family,"Kimberley, Canada ",Loved it...,"We were spring skiing and got just that with cool mornings and warm afternoons that softened things up. They do a good job of grooming so we’d start at 9 and go hard down low, then stay on upper chairs when bottom started to crowd. We’d love to hit the steeps on a powder trip....they look amazing."
47,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2019 , Friends,New York ,The BEST!,"This mountain is the grande dame of American ski mountains. It always gets snow, always keeps it, and despite a challenging environment, the ski is safe and super fun. The ski school is simply the best too."
48,Rendezvous-Mountain,Apr 2018 , Friends,"Cleveland Heights, OH ",Challenging and Breathtaking!,"Jackson Hole always pushes me out of my comfort zone in the best way possible. If it's cloudy, the snow is falling, if it's clear you have prime view of the Tetons. One of my favorite places!"
49,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2019 , Friends,"Gig Harbor, WA ",Maybe on a sunny day...,"Rode the tram to the top in white-out conditions. Don't recommend it. Wait in line an hr on a weekday in Feb. See nothing. Snow blowing sideways at the top. Did have a waffle at the cabin, but not worth the effort if there is no visibility."
50,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2019 , Solo,"Sioux City, IA ",World class skiing with enough steep and snow for all.,"Spent 6 days in February and received over 50 inches of snow which provided exceptional skiing. This is a destination mountain and it does have a lot of black diamond runs. Beautiful country and incredible fun. Even with the snow amounts, the traffic was still able to get to the mountain although Teton Pass was closed one day. Air service in to Jackson and there are shuttles in to town. Also shuttles from the town of Jackson to the mountain. Will visit again and not just for the mountain but everything else that comes with it."
51,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Jackson, Wyoming ",BIG mountain skiing!,"This mountain has something for everyone but if you like challenging runs and big mountain skiing it should be on your bucket list. A top to bottom run can wear you out. Use maps and ski hosts for the first day or two since there are places you can get lost. Lots of out of bounds skiing to, but bring your gear for that.  Great restaurants, kids ski programs, big groomed runs, tree skiing, open bowls etc. Jackson has it all."
52,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Jackson, WY ",Best in West and the World,"For the best adventure in skiing or boarding, ride the tram to this incredible location. From here you access a plethora of runs from chutes to trees to the incomparable Hobacks and Corbetts Couloir. Lines can be long so plan your day accordingly be getting in line way early, or catch late afternoon trams. Lots of skiing can be accessed by Bridger Gondola to Thunder and Sublette Chairs while those lines lessen."
53,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Minneapolis, MN ",Steep and deep,"The mountain is not for the faint of heart. It's steep, fast and challenging for all levels of skiers. The equipment is first rate and moves lots of people with only a few hangups, like the tram lines. They have opened up new areas and lifts the past years that help the congestion. Plenty of shops and places to eat. The one downside is the price which per run or lift is getting out of hand. Perhaps with all the modern scanning they could charge you by the use and not the day. Thiunk about that."
54,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Ridgewood, NJ ",Not for the first time skier,"I highly recommend getting a ski instructor to take you around if you are like me and a solid intermediate skier . Some of the trails are poorly marked and you may start out on a Blue , go down a Double Blue and end up on a Black . Yikes !  I recommend facing the mountain and starting to the right -  - Teewinot , nice easy greens for your first run.  - Move up from Teewinot to Apres Vous Quad Chair and take Werner and Upper werner  (I could do these runs all day .)  -The sun moves from right to left , so head to Sweetwater Gondola and take Casper quad with runs like Easy Does it  - go to Bridger Gondola up to Rendezvous Lodge for a nice lunch and sunny spot  ( outdoor picnic tables )  -Take Lupine way and Amphitheatre ( wide open )  - The mountain gets progressively harder the further left you go  DO NOT TAKE THE TRAM !!!  This is for Expert skiers and it is no joke to get down .  It's a fun ride to really see the mountain on a sunny day , grab a waffle at the top and to ride it right back down .  Loved this mountain but , boy , you better respect it .  ."
55,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Liberty Township, OH ",Gondola ride and Waffles,"We are not skiers, but visited Rendezvous Mountain and Teton Village one day. We rode the gondola to the top and enjoyed the waffles at Corbin's Cabin. We had Strawberry waffles. It is a very small place, but seats become available quickly. We walked around the upper platform and took in the views of the area. It can be quite windy and cooler up top, so plan accordingly."
56,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2019 , Solo,"Los Angeles, CA ","Great snow, trails and staff.","Great skiing and the staff in the stores, restaurants and rental and storage areas were wonderful. Young, vibrant, upscale atmosphere yet perfect for skiers and travelers of all ages."
57,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2019 , Couples,"South Hackensack, NJ ",Amazing,"Breathtaking experience. Will definitely be coming back.  Bring a good camera, dress warm, and enjoy it."
58,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2018 , Family,"Flowery Branch, GA ",If you need a challenge,"One of the best ski resorts in the US but ONLY if you are a strong intermediate or expert. If you have beginners head elsewhere. Also one of the pricier resorts so if you are looking for a ""deal"" on skiing look over the hill at Grand Targhee. Also weather can cause delays in and out of JH airport so just be ready for that possibility."
59,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2018,not available,"Berlin, Germany ",Incredible views & great atmosphere,"We took the ""big red"" gondola up the mountain as tourists and without skis it was pretty obvious! The vibe on the gondola & on the mountain reminded me of the European Alps and mountain huts. It was freezing cold & windy, which only added to the this special experience. The hot chocolate & waffles at ""Corbet's cabin"" were delicous & special. Well worth the money & time!"
60,Rendezvous-Mountain,Nov 2018 , Family, ,Wonderful Experience,"We rode the tram - make sure you pick up a coupon at the airport - to the peak. We stopped for an obligatory waffle and hot chocolate. Staff was friendly. Heavy snow was falling so we didn’t have a panoramic view, but I’m sure it’s gorgeous on a clear day. Well worth the money."
61,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Huntington Bay, NY ","Well organized, well maintained, great people, great facility, loved the cable cars.","The view from the top was outstanding, the people were great, the restaurant was amazing considering it was several thousand feet up the mountain, and the cable cars were a really good experience, with a few nervous nellies on our trip feeling comfortable enough to ride them with confidence."
62,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Monument, CO, ",A must do adventure to the top,"This was our second trip to the top and it was cold and windy but so worth the view. The cable car is fast, smooth and fun to ride. There is also a coffee/sandwich shop at the top."
63,Rendezvous-Mountain,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Boylston, MA, ",A great ride up the mountain.,"The tram ride was very enjoyable somewhat cold when you got to the top at 14,500 feet. Great views at the top going up and coming down. An attraction not to be missed while in Jackson Hole."
64,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Splendid views!,"We got lucky in that we took the cable car on the day when the Roosevelt fire had just broken out, so we saw the smoke plume rising, and the dust and smoke thickening. Yes the trip is expensive but we found it worthwhile."
65,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Friends, ,Stunning fall foliage,"The views at the top are spectacular. We were lucky enough to visit when the aspens were in full fall glory. It is cool on the top, so be sure to dress warm. The staff was certainly enjoying their job and we sang along with the music. A very entertaining morning for sure!"
66,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Strongsville, OH ",Worth it !!,"The views at the top are great, weather permitting. Dress for cooler weather, it can get cold up there.  Corbet's restaurant serves waffles, but don't make that your main meal. Maybe just as a treat.  The ride up and down is also very fun for kids and adults ..."
67,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Friends,Dallas ,Tram ride to the top,Fall colors - aspens turning yellow against the green of the pines is stunning. Bike riders on the trails below us as we climber to the summit in the tram.
68,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Henderson, NV, ",Views/Hiking/Views!!,"Fast Aerial Tram up to find beautiful views and the famous Corbet’s Couloir ski slope. The staff who works this aerial tram are just great! It was windy and 15 degrees cooler so dress in layers (54 degrees in early September). You can enjoy the magnificent views and/or hike the many trails. We did a small hike and it was a strenuous! Loved watching the hang gliders takeoff from here. You can enjoy waffles, drink and snacks at Corbet's Cabin."
69,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2017 , Friends,", ",Wow,"The après-ski scene here doesn't begin to compare with other places I've been, but the skiing is spectacular!!!"
70,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Linthicum Heights, MD ",A great hike and view,"We took the tram up and then did a 7 mile hike. The tram ride is fun and the view at the top is amazing! It was a great hike as well. Didn't see any critters (maybe a pica, not sure), but it was a great hike."
71,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Plano, United States ",Great Views from Rendezvous Mountain,We took the tram to the mountain for great views. We took some small hikes around the top and saw a Marmet sunning himself on a rock outcropping. The tram is expensive but the views were great.
72,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Lakewood Ranch, FL ",Really fun!,"The views are spectacular! Love the mountains down to the fantastic valley below. Spend as much time as you like and if you're lucky like I was, you can watch the Paragliders launch from the 10,000ft altitude. It was so amazing, I went back and jumped off the mountain at 10,000ft and glided to the valley 4000ft below. EXCELLENT ! ! !"
73,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Solo,"Tinton Falls, NJ ",Tram ride to the top,"Great experience riding the tram to the top. Very windy, but the views were excellent. Took photos from different perspectives."
74,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Couples,Tennessee ,Tram and Waffles,"We spent a little time in Jackson Hole during our trip to visit Grand Teton National Park. This is outside of the park and a short drive from Jackson, WY. In this village type area, you have plenty of free parking, lodging, shops, and a tram to ride to the top of the mountain for sightseeing or for skiing. If you buy the tickets online, you can save about $8. The ticket is good for the tram and the other ride to the restaurant about half way up the mountain and is good for the whole day. If you go to the top of Rendezvous Mountain, look for the cute cabin selling waffles. They are so flavorful! They give them to you in foil and you eat with your fingers — no forks offered. There is coffee there as well as bottled juice and tea. The drinks were pretty costly I thought but a waffle for over $7 is not too cheap either. However, I did enjoy being there and eating that tasty waffle! The views are incredible and the ride on the tram was pretty awesome. It takes 12 minutes to get to the top of the mountain in the tram and you can stay up there as long as you like for the day. Remember it is colder up there than in the village so be prepared."
75,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2018 , Friends,"The Villages, FL ","Great Ride, Great Views!","Definitely worth the cost, at least on the day we were there. Smooth ride up and down with great views all around. Take your time at the top to soak in the beauty and come back down when you are ready (not a timed ticket). Take other reviewers suggestions to save money by buying online, or use a coupon available on many handouts or maps. We had a quick, delicious lunch from the taco truck just up the hill from the tram, too."
76,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Family,"Washington DC, DC ",Windy -- but a beautiful view,"It's a little spare up there, but there are hiking paths and a waffle place, decorated with the skis and snowboards of young people (men, that is) who have dies doing the sports they love. Great views of the valley -- just dress smart and be aware that the wind really blows up there..."
77,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018,not available,"Phoenixville, PA ",Enjoy the Mountain,It was 80z+ degrees at the base but when we got top the top it was blowing like a hurricane - which made it feel very chilly as it was also quite cooler up top (in the 50's).    We are skiers but have never been here before so we greatly appreciated seeing what the mountain looked like without snow and enjoyed the cable car/tram ride.    It is an expensive trip but …. we thought worth it.
78,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Friends, ,A great location for base camp!,"We rented a house for 5 couples in Teton Village. This was a great location for excursions to Grand Teton NP, Jackson, WY, and other nearby locations. We did several hikes on Rendezvous Mountain. Took the tram to the peak, ate waffles, did the Top of the World Trail.    The wildflower were in bloom and served as a great backdrop for pictures. The base village had everything you need. Quick drive to local grocery markets, City of Jackson, and Grand Teton NP.    Great location and beautiful setting."
79,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Family,"Boston, MA ",Tram to top and hiked to the top of the gondola,Great adventure with 3 teenage kids! The waffles at Corbets provided energy to hike down. The trails were well marked and the wild flowers were amazing.
80,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Durham, NC ",Riding the Tram up the mountain,"Fabulous ride up the mountain in a tram, view spectacular. Fun to walk around the top and take pictures from the coffee shop. Not to be missed."
81,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Solo,"Jackson, Mississippi ",Great view,Great view of the valley and a lot of good trails to hike. You can ride the tram up and hike down to the gondola if you don’t have much time.
82,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Family,"Frederick, MD ",Wow!,"Bought the tickets locally at a store on the town square which was the same price as online. Saves you quite a bit. Even cheaper when you buy the family pass (two adults and up to four kids).    The ride was incredible! It was crazy how it seemed like you were hardly moving upward at all it was so smooth. The operators were chatty and seemed happy to be there. The views from the top were incredible. You can check their website for conditions on the the top. For us it was 88 degrees at the bottom and 61 at the top (and breezy). Save bet is to bring a jacket with you.    The thing that was fantastic was that it is an all day pass for all the operating lifts... so we rode them all. Fantastic!    The waffles at the restaurant at the top smelled good, but we had a few adult beverages and enjoyed walking around.    This is a must do!"
83,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Jackson Hole, WY ","7 seconds to spare, last tram down, we made it!!!","If you would have asked me if I was going to make the last tram down that evening, I was fully prepared mentally to just stay the night on the mountain....after all, it was a hot 90+ out, The muscles in my legs were spent in a way they were spitting me back out, and the last 2 switch backs were physically going to break me that day!!!! We dug from a place I didnt know I had....and found a energy in ourselves that we hadn't seen in awhile (at least not me)...the cheers of the fellow tram sharers, the rocking 80's music on the ride down, priceless....from the bottom up! Not for the faint of heart!"
84,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Family,"Indianapolis, IN ",A must see!!,We stayed in Teton Village and hung out so to speak at the mountain. We debated the expensive Tram ride and finally went. Cheaper if you buy on line!! It was well worth it.
85,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2018 , Family,"Milano, TX ",Fantastic at the top,We took the tram up to the top of the mountain. What a view. The top was so wonderful and a beautiful view. Don't forget a sweater or jacket though and definitely try the waffles.
86,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Wellesley, MA ",Shorter hike than it looks - fun with amazing views!,"My husband and I visited Jackson Hole and purchased Tram/Gondola passes with the intention of hiking the Cirque Trail, which starts from the top of the Gondola. However, when we reached the top, we were disappointed to find that the Cirque Trail was CLOSED! Wish they woulda posted that at the bottom!!! So, we went back down and rode the Tram to the top. Once on top, we could see a trail heading off to the left, so we started following it. Soon, we could see a chain of peaks with hikers along the ridgeline in the distance. Looked like fun, so we followed. We got to what appeared to be 1/2 way to the final peak, but were getting pressed for time and did not think we'd make it - being in our mid-50's. We saw 2 young women (early 20's) who had just come from the peak. They said the distance was deceivingly long, and it was only about 10 minutes out. We decided to go for it. They were right. And we were glad to have gone all the way out! All together, it was a 2.5m hike. Some rock scrabble and a bit of climbing, but nothing too technical or scary."
87,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Solo,"Utopia, TX ",Great fun with the family,This was a great day trip for the family. rode two out of the three lifts. Enjoyed refreshments at the restaurant. Views were spectacular.
88,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Bethesda, OH ",Beautiful Views,"Rode the tram to the top of Rendevous Mountain. Great ride and great views. Under same ticket price, rode lift to top of another section. Don’t plan to eat up there - bring your own food if you plan to stay a little whille. The price of food is outrageous, but you’re paying for the view. There are plenty of tables and chairs to eat lunch, but they were out of most everything when we arrived at 2pm."
89,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Port Orchard, Wa ",Top of the world,"A highlight of our trip. Booked online which saved money. The wait in line was maybe 5 minutes, but the 12 minute ride up was incredible! When you step off and walk the few stairs to a viewing area, you really feel like you are on top of the world!!  We only hiked to a couple of different viewing areas...all were great. Plus my wife took pictures of every wild flower she could find.  Of course we HAD to have the waffles...brown sugar butter all over them. Probably not good for my diet but I walked those calories off! (I can justify anything!)    HIGHLY recommend this!!!"
90,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018,not available,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Need to take the tram,The resort is beautiful in itself. take the tram to the top. $15. Great view at the top of the Tetons. Nice ride up the mountain. Can do several hikes at the top. Play in the snow. Great awesome views. This was one of the highlights of the trip
91,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Family,"San Francisco, CA ",Great Hiking,"I hiked the Wildflower Trail and had a great time! The views of the Teton Valley are breathtaking. Wildflowers were just starting to bloom. Took me the full 3 hours but I did stop often for picture taking. I went by myself which was fine because there were a lot of people on the trail. Plus, there are a lot of workers on the mountain clearing trees and brush. Lot's of bug bites so use bug spray!"
92,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Family,"Oregon City, Oregon ",Better hiking signage needed,"This tram is a must do. We purchased tickets online which saved our party of three several $. The views were awesome. Our objective was to hike to the bottom on a trail but instead found ourselves on the service road going down. Taking the service road down is not that much fun. It was made for a truck, not foot traffic. We did not see any signage directing us to the trail we were hoping to take down. Along the way a member of our party was careless on a patch of snow/ice and suffered an injury. Thankfully, we were able to hike to the top of a different gondola on the mountain to ride down. The hike up to that gondola was brutal in the heat. It would have taken at least two more hours to hike the service road and connect with a foot trail further down."
93,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Glen Saint Mary, FL ",Great experience,We rode the tram to the top. Enjoyed beautiful 66 degree weather and views. My lovely wife thought hiking the trails back down the mountain to the resort would be “fun”. It was...for the first three hours. Fun factor declined after that. It’s about 8 miles back down by the route we took. The Wildflower trail was awesome. There are other options if you want to hike down. Like hike over to the gondola part way down the mountain then ride it down. I’d highly recommend the tram up. Booked on line and saved money. Tickets were ready when we walked to the office. Great experience...despite the hike😛
94,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Family,"Redwood City, CA, ",Great sightseeing,Went to the top of the mountain and a FANTASTIC view. Great picture opportunities. Was a little chilly after the warm weather at the bottom so pack a jacket or sweater.
95,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Family,"Birmingham, AL ",Must-see Rendezvous Mountain,"We took the tram up on a beautiful July day. The weather was a little chilly at first but then warmed up as we were taking a small hike around the mountain top. Stunning views, beautiful wildlife and flowers are everywhere. We even played in the snow."
96,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Tucson, AZ ",Views were awesome!,"Although I didn't get any pictures of wildlife, the views after taking the cable car to the top were fantastic!"
97,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Family,"Cincinnati, OH ",Great Views,My family went here on our first day. The views from the tram on the top were amazing however I walked a little too fast to get to top of mountain and maybe suffered from the altitude just for a moment. I suggest to take it slow and just enjoy. You will not be disappointed.
98,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Waycross, GA ",What a trip!!,"Awesome ride on the tram up the mountain! And the waffes at the top were to die for!!!WE had the best time going up and seeing the scenery from 10,500 feet! The snow capped mountains and valleys were beautiful! And what a photo op!!"
99,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Couples, ,Must see to believe,"Spectacular views of God's work    Take in the views as you ascend to the top of Rendevouz Mountain.    Enjoy a waffle and a beer, maybe a shot of wiskey    Great location for taking photos"
100,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018,not available, ,Spectacular views from the mountain top.,"We rode the tram to the top of Rendezvous mountain for beautiful views in all directions. It's a nice activity to plan if you only have a couple of hours. The line was relatively quick. It was a bit pricey for our family of five, but that's apparently part of the Jackson experience. Nevertheless, it was worth the majestic views!"
101,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Santa Ana, CA ",Fun ride!,"We were staying in the Village and were able to walk on over to the tram. Buying tickets on line saved some money which was great - just gave them the confirmation # so no need to print anything out.    The views from the tram are amazing and not scary even when it swung a little. :)    The views at the top are breathtaking. Having a cane helps to climb some of the steps as they are steep - I'm 5'1"" and they could be a challenge, but did fine.    The ticket can be used on the lifts as well and good for the day."
102,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Family, ,anniversary celebration,Celebrated my sister's 50th wedding anniversary at the top of the mountain - even with my brother-in-law's broken leg. They were able to get us all to the top on the tram.
103,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Foley, AL ",Do not miss- it was awesome,"This is in Teton Village which is 3 miles from Jackson Hole. We paid 45.00 and rode all three rides. The team took you where they ski and paraglide. I so wanted to paraglide but it was 345.00. It was awesome to watch. Then rode the gondola up. It doesn't go as far up but it's a wonderful ride. It has a bike lift so people ride to the top and bike down. Has different courses, challenging and less . then we took the other ride up can't what it was called . it was enclosed and my least favorite way to ride. Nice area up top to sitting area that was beautiful. Had pizza, salads and others things to eat. Pizza smelled awesome. Do not miss rendezvous mountain. Forget to say they serve waffles at the top of the team ride."
104,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018,not available,"Columbus, OH ",Don't Forget Your Binoculars,"We stayed at the Snake River Lodge at the base of this mountain, which is a very short walk to the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram. We took the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram to the top, which reached an elevation of 10,450 feet. Our kids had some delicious hot waffles at Corbet's Cabin. We forgot our binoculars but were able to put a quarter into the viewfinder and take in the scenery. If you prefer indoor plumbing, don't forget to use the bathroom before you go up, because Corbet's Cabin only has outhouse style bathrooms. You feel like you are on top of the world. This is a must-see."
105,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Family,"Oklahoma City, United States ",Great Views,"Great place to visit, waffles was great and the view is crazy cool. Very cool place to go. What is really great is we were able to use the pass all day."
106,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Friends, ,Perfect Day,"Beautiful ride up the tram and a relaxed hours to view the para-gliders soaring off the cliff into the blue. The little lodge at the top sells waffles. I got the lemon that was a little dry, but my friend opted for the Nutella and it was yum. No plumbing though, so do your business before you head up."
107,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Family,"Galena, OH ",Awesome view,We went up in the summer for the most amazing view! Not sure what it wold be like to ski here - looks steep to me - but the summer view on a clear day takes your breath away!
108,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Rockingham, NC ",Snowing!!,"The tram is a must do activity for us when we visit. June 11 - we took the tram and it began snowing half way up and was incredible! A cup of hot chocolate was in order as soon as we got off the tram on the mountain! It was very windy, snowing, and cold, but it was totally worth it!!"
109,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2018 , Family,"Mariah Hill, IN ",Breathtaking,"We took the Jackson Hole Tram to the top. Had a waffle at Corbett's Cabin, which is a little pricey, but how many people can say they've had waffles on top of a mountain! Beautiful views and worth the trip for sure!"
110,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Family,"Colorado Springs, CO ",A bit expensive but worth it if you want a view of the entire valley,We only had a couple hours to tour Jackson Hole on our way to Yellowstone so we decided to ride the tram to the top. Well worth the money and time especially since we saw quite few paragliders take off from the top and then watched as they soared down the mountain. Even my son who is a bit afraid of heights managed to enjoy himself. Be sure to take a jacket; it's often windy and cold at the top!
111,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2018 , Business,"Washington DC, DC ",Breathtaking views among the spectacular Tetons,"Be sure to fit this into your trip! The views from the top of Rendezvous are spectacular—we felt like we were in the middle of the Himalayas at moments. The tram ride is 15 minutes each way. And you could easily spend between 30 minutes and an hour at the top, depending on whether you stop to eat at the waffle restaurant. The photos of this part of our trip are incredible."
112,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2018 , Family,"Alexandria, LA ",Wonderful views!,The most wonderful views you can ever imagine! We were at the top of the mountain in June and it was 37 degrees and snowing. You must have a waffle from Corbett's cabin once you get to the top! Must do!
113,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2018 , Solo,"Golden, CO ",so much fun,I love the snowboarding on this mountain! Endless options. Will definitely be back for more of this epic adventure
114,Rendezvous-Mountain,Apr 2018 , Couples,"Driggs, ID ",Great Mid-day Ski Lunch Place,Good lunch menu and well prepared meals. Medium priced for a ski resort. Great Views. If you lunch early it will be less crowded.
115,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2018 , Couples,Southern California ,Awesome and challenging ski mountain,I skied many resorts in the US and Canada - Jackson Hole is definitely among the top ski mountains I have been. A lot of challenging terrain and it seems to snow almost every day - happy powder days :-)
116,Rendezvous-Mountain,Apr 2018 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Fun & Scary!,"We went for one day during a major blizzard with lots of wind - visibility was limited and took a few spills. Still, absolutely breath taking! Even for non-skiers, the tram ride is heated with breathtaking views (I’m sure it’s even better with clear weather)! We loved the mountain, and the beginner lessons are a must if you haven’t skied for years. Wonderful experience."
117,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2018 , Family, ,So much skiable terrain,"Second time at JH. What a great mountain. Lots of challenging terrain, some good, long, well-designed runs, efficient lift system, and incredible views (it is part of the Teton Range, after all). Snow can be a bit iffy, but when it's good, it's really, really good."
118,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Hopewell, NJ ",An American Legend,"I've been coming to Jackson Hole every year for years and there is no place like it. There's a bit of the wild west in the Jackson Hole terrain. It's a bit steep and not a great place never evers. But even if you're a solid intermediate, you will go home a better skier. And if you're already an expert, you have found the ultimate ski playground. The trail map tells just part of the story because except for closed areas, what you see, you can ski. Open bowls, trees and meadows, cliffs-it's all in play and the excitement you will experience is amazing."
119,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2018 , Family,"Mount Tremper, NY ",Rendezvous bowl is a dramatic way to experience the natural beauty of Jackson Hole,"Skiers come to Jackson Hole from around the world for the rugged beauty, the ski scene, and of course the wide variety of amazing terrain across several mountains - ranging from the blue groomers of Aprez Vous to the famously steep and gnarly Tower 5 and Alta Chutes. Rendezvous Bowl is a black diamond run off the peak (serviced by the huge Tram, a bus-sized funicular that goes from the base all the way to the peak), and provides the advanced skier with a steep but manageable way to see the sights from the very top. Highly recommended, Rendezvous Bowl provides the thrills of big mountain skiing without the panic of the sheer drops and cliffs of Corbett's Couloir."
120,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Phoenix, AZ ",THE BIG ONE,The tram takes you to the top of this amazing mountain. The Gondola takes you to a great place for summer cocktails.
121,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2017 , Couples,"San Antonio, TX ","The tram, or gondola, at Teton Village, north of Jackson WY","Their is a large tram, or gondola, up Rendezvous Mountain above and including the ski runs west of Teton Village, which is the ski village north of Jackson, WY. It ain't cheap, we paid $34 each in late August, and we are seniors. Thats the walkup price. It's cheaper if you order online. The cars are large. I believe they hold up to forty people.  The twelve munute trip runs you from about 6,000 feet elevation in Teton Village to over 10,000 at the top, which is on Rendezvous Mountain. The trip provides gorgeous views of the Snake River valley. On a clear day like we had it was spectacular in all directions. At the top there is an eatery which specializes in waffles. In ski season. No kidding.  You can stay on top as long as you want. Even in August it was cool, and the wind was brisk. Layer up!  Hily recommended if you don't mind the cost."
122,Rendezvous-Mountain,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Hamilton, New Zealand, ",Good view but cold,"Book on line, save $7 per person (only $30).  Be prepared for the cold wind, especially in October.  The waffles at the top are over rated really, expensive for what you get.    Was still worth the trip up for the view.  The team itself is interesting but not amazing."
123,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2017 , Family,Vermont ,"WOW, WOW and WOW!","You have got to do this if you go to Jackson Hole! The view on the way up is breath-taking! You will feel like a bird! We experienced standing in the snow 10,450 feet up in September looking across to other rugged peaks. If you decide to do this and the temp is 60 in Jackson, be assured that the temp. will be 30 or below on the mountain top. Well worth dressing in layers! To ""top"" it all off, the waffle house at the top is warm and inviting with hot coffee and delicious waffles served in foil. Don't expect table service! You can roam around all you want on this mountain but just remember how far down it is if you don't watch where you are going! To get your tickets, go to the front of the building where there is a ticket window, not up the tram area like we did (had to go back down and around to buy tickets). The tram leaves every 15 minutes, Huge viewing windows. get settled in the benches in the front for the best view. A resort employee is inside with you at all times and will answer any questions and help you if you need it. Not many places to sit, so if you want to sit down it is worth waiting for the next tram to be first in line. ( now crowds in Sept. though)."
124,Rendezvous-Mountain,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Greensburg, PA ",Take the Tram here,The tram goes to Rendevous Mt. Slick. Tram ride is $30/pp. Worth it. Goes approximately 4000 feet up in about 10 minutes. May be a bit off on the distance covered.
125,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Rochester Hills, MI ",Jackson Hole in the Summer,"So we have a friend that lives in Jackson Hole. Teton Village is super cool. You can catch the tram up to the top of the mountain. Even though it was September, there was snow! It is about 10 degrees cooler at the top of Rendezvous, so dress accordingly. Once at the top the views are amazing. Grab a waffle or a drink. I could never imagine skiing down this mountain, but the views are breath taking. Grab a drink at the Mangy Moose at Teton Village. Cool atmosphere."

128,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2017 , Family,"Patchogue, NY ",The top is tops!,"The view is simply outstanding and breathtaking! Our children (14,11 &8) were all in amazement at the view. The waffle place is a real find. The food is great and they have a good selection of adult beverages for us parents.    You can take a trail down to the base or go back down the tram. Both offer great views.    Bring a jacket and sunglasses. The sun is stronger and it is cooler at the top. Be careful with the thin air and the young ones. Pushing yourself just a little too much will make you feel like you ran a marathon.    Well worth the time and money!!"
129,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2017 , Couples, ,Waffles at the Top of the World!,"Rode the Tram to the Top of the World (10,450 feet elevation) and enjoyed great views.

The coffee shop at the summit serves great coffee and extraordinary waffles.
134,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Annapolis, MD ",Great views and Delicious waffles!!!,The tram ride is fun and the views are amazing. You must stop in a Corbet's Cabin for a waffle! We had the brown sugar cinnamon and it was awesome!!

139,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2017 , Family,"Ringgold, GA ",Great views,"Even though it's expensive, it's worth it to take the tram up, have a waffle and check out the views. There was still snow when we were there due to the record year, and it's very windy so bring a jacket."
140,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2017 , Family, ,A must do when near Jackson or Driggs,We took our teenagers and younger children on the tram ride. It's was great! Only 12 minutes up and 12 down. You can stay at the peak as long as you want. There are bathrooms up there as well as a great little spot to get waffles. The views are spectacular! The guide inside the tram offers lots of interesting info about the area and what the skiing is like in winter. The tram ticket also includes a ride on the gondola!

It is a MUST when visiting Jackson Hole. My friends and I took the tram to the top and hiked down to the gondola. It was rated as difficult, but for four moderately in-shape girls it was an easy hike. The few times you are hiking on the side of a steep cliff are worth the views!! 360 degrees of amazing!"
142,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2017 , Family, ,Spectacular view,This experience was nothing short of breathtaking. I would recommend you plan your entire day at Grand Teton Village to take in all the exciting adventures.
143,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Couples,California ,Unbelievable views - just breathtaking.,"We took the free green line shuttle from Jackson to Teton Village to take the aerial tram. It was hard to know which direction to look, as the views were incredible on all sides."
144,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Ashford, UK ",Brilliant views from the top.,"We went on the gondola, chairlift and tram. Excellent value. A cold beer at thr top was the icing on the cake!"
145,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2017 , Family,"Tampa, FL ","Amazing views, great waffles!","the tram ride was spectacular and the waffles at the top were melt in your mouth! grab a complimentary ski pole at the top to walk a tril due to the loose gravel , but be mindful that you are 10,400 ft and once you walk down a little on a trail, you have to hike back up. That is not easy at this elevation if you are not used to it. The view is unbelievable!"
146,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Family,"Glenwood, IA ",Oh say can you see!,"What an amazing trip to the top of Rendezvous! We took the aerial tram up to the top and were amazed at the views! While you're there, you've gotta go get some waffles at Corbett's Cabin. Climb the stairs and you're at the top; 10450 feet above sea level!"
147,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Franklin, TN ",Nice view of the mountains and the valley,"Fun ride to the top of mountain crammed into a tram with about 50 of your new friends! Once there, however, the views are spectacular. There is a small ""cabin"" where you can get some refreshments (water, beer, wine, soft drinks) and waffles (interesting but apparently popular choice). Importantly, while you are having fun, there is a crew watching out for your safety. A brief storm blew through (with lightning) while we were on top and they herded us all into the cabin and shut down the tram until it blew over. Still I was amazed by how many parents let small kids roam unsupervised beyond the boundary ropes and dangerously close to one slip away from disaster."
148,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Ocean Park, WA ",What a view,"First book your tickets online you will save money. The ride is smooth and provides beautiful views of the surrounding country. Once on top, WOW absolutely gorgeous... Well worth the time!"
149,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Family,"Denton, Texas, United States ",Love this activity - perfect for an hour or two,"The tram to the top allows beautiful views of the entire area around Teton Village. The tram is huge, and barely sways at all; it feels extremely safe. Seating is quite limited in the tram but the trip is show (12 minutes) so not bad for those standing. The views from the top are breathtaking, and seem to change almost daily as the snow melts. Note: it can be extremely cold at the top, even when it's warm at the base. Wind can be very strong as well - come prepared! Waffles at the top seem over-priced until you eat one - then it all makes sense. The ""Trad"" is the favorite of all 8 in our family, and over the years we've tried them all. Hot chocolate is good as well. The wait can be long depending on crowds, and seating is minimal, but it's worth it. Hiking a bit down from the top is relatively easy and worthwhile as the view changes upon rounding the corner. This has become an annual tradition for our family. Well worth doing."
150,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017,not available,"San Jose, California, United States ","Beautiful view on ""Big Red""","Rode the state-of-the-art gondola, ""Big Red"" to the summit of Rendezvous Mountain. The temperature was considerable lower at the summit so dress in layers. There's a small gift shop at the top with souvenirs as well as refreshments. The tram runs every 15 minutes."
151,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Sunnyvale, CA ",The tram ride provides gorgeous views,"The tram (ski lift) up Rendezvous Mountain provided gorgeous views of the valley. It is stunning and quite worthwhile. It runs in the summer for tourists and in the winter for skiers.    The tram takes about 12 minute to go from approximately 5,000 feet to 10,000 feet in the summer; in the winter it is a little faster for skiers who do not care about views.    We were there in June. At the top it was about 50 degrees F, windy, and cold. So we took the first tram back down. If you want to stay up top at 10,000 feet then I recommend layers of clothes with a heavy jacket in the summer.    I have a moderate fear of heights, but I was able to be reasonably comfortable on this tram."
152,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Family,Connecticut ,Perfect attraction,"A great ride to the top and what a view! Words can't describe the vastness and overall beauty that awaits you at the top. Great for families and/or couples. There is no such thing as a bad seat on the tram because the view is wonderful and the ride up is well worth it, even if heights aren't your thing."
153,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Family,"Lincoln, NE ","Waffles at 10,000 feet","The tram ride up to Rendezvous mountain was quick...11 minutes...but what a ride. Who thought of waffles in their place at the top? My wife: Peanut butter and bacon on hers. I went traditional on mine: brown sugar butter. You see the whole ""hole"" from above."
154,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Duluth, MN ",On Top of the Tetons,"From Jackson Hole, drive to Teton Village and take the smooth tram ride to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. You won't regret it! In fact, it just might be one of the highlights of your trip. The view from the town is absolutely spectacular: The Grand Tetons, vistas as far as the eye can see, brilliant blue sky, green forests, Climb a bit higher, if you wish, or go into the small restaurant for a beverage and a waffle. Breathe in the fresh air and drink in the view!"
155,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Zionsville, IN ","Take the Tram, Great Pix, Better View","You can take the tram from the base 360+ days/year and if in the area, please do. Always 20 - 40 degrees cooler, take a jacket whenever you go. The tram ride is fun, but the real fun is when you step off of the tram. Pure fun. Take the 25 - 30 steps to go to the top, great pix opportunity. Can never get enough. Toughest task is to take a great pix without folks who you don't want in e pix. Eventually you cave because it can be very cool. Then take the short walk to the waffle shop. They have more than waffles but they smell pretty good (we had already eaten). But they also have drinks, snacks, etc. The trip down is just as much as the trip up - now you know what to look for. You don't have to know how to ski or be athletic, you do need to want to have fun."
156,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Charleston, AR ",Definitely a must see,My wife and I really enjoyed riding the tram to the top of the mountain. The view was amazing. Definitely worth the cost.
157,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Family,"Shrewsbury, MA ",Breathtaking,Took the tram to the top with the family. Both my adult kids para-glided down with experienced instructors. Great views and picture taking opportunities. Had we gone a week later we could have hiked down. Next time!
158,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Washington DC, DC ",a must seew,"If you are going to Jackson, you simple must ride the tram up this mountain it is breathtaking.. A comfortable ride and well worth the cost."
159,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2017 , Friends,"Sowerby Bridge, UK ",Its an absolute must...for all ages..,Exhilarating...worth the journey even though you may be a little nervous...GO FOR IT..the views are spectacular...the tram operator was informative and friendly...its worth the money and its got concessions..
160,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2017 , Couples,"Fort Myers , Fla ",Ride the Tram,"Great trip to the top of the mountain via tram. Fun watching the paragliders launch themselves from the top. Views are spectacular. Great spot, don't miss it."
161,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2017 , Couples,"Weymouth, UK ",Stunning views from the mountain top,"You can get to the summit easily on the aerial tram, that's a cable car to us Europeans! Quite expensive for a 12 minute journey but the views are breathtaking."
162,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2017 , Couples,"Singapore, Singapore ",Great fun at the top!,It was really windy but we had a great time climbing to the summit and getting the panoramic views all round.
163,Rendezvous-Mountain,Apr 2017,not available,"Dunsborough, Australia ","Outstanding people, outstanding resort",Our trip here was short but we extended it by 2 days because we liked it so much. The people were open and inviting and the place was breathtaking. There is so much to do and see in Jackson Hole that I would recommend it to everyone.
164,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2017 , Family,"Stockholm, Sweden, ",For skier who likes challenges,"With the words of the cabin driver ringing in your ears this day with lousy visibility. ""Remember that this is expert terrain. If you can not go down on their own are able to take the cabin lift down again in ten minutes. Take care of you out there."" When a sign at Jackson Hole says ‘cliff’ it really means it! Jackson Hole can also boast the full three national parks: Grand Teton Park, the National Elk Refuge and the world famous Yellowstone Park. In fact, the dramatic scenery and the rich wildlife attracts more tourists in the summer than skiing makes winter."
165,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2017 , Family,"Darien, CT ","Take the Tram to the Top, but be a good skier!",This is the top of the Mountain and worth the trip. If you are not the best skier you might want to think twice about skiing down from there! The waffles at the top are fun and the kids loved it. Worth it if you are skiing!
166,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2017 , Solo,"Storrs, CT ",View from the top.,"If you take the ski tram from the base of the Jackson Hole ski resort, you get a grand view to the reondevous mountains. The tram ticket for non-skiers was $32. Well worth it."
167,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2017 , Friends,"Carlsbad, NM ",Tough mountain worth the trip,"I skied JH four days in Feb/Mar, and made two trips to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. The first trip was a white knuckle descent in blinding windy conditions. The second trip was in sunshine with a mild breeze and a nice view. This mountain definitely makes its own weather! If you are up for an adventure, take the Tram to the top."
168,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2017 , Friends,WorldWide ,Jackson Hole is the biggest and baddest.,I skied Jackson Hole today and it was fabulous. The terrain is second to none. It's vast and imposing. I had a great day and even scared myself a little. Go BIG at Jackson.
169,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2017 , Family,"Hopewell Junction, NY ",One more for the 'Bucket List',"Jackson Hole has been on my bucket list for years and we finally made it happen. If you like challenging terrain (chutes, glades, steeps, bowls) it is easily available from just about every lift but there are less difficult traverses and routes down if your group has varied abilities. I think that is what sets is apart from Utah, etc. No long traverses to get vertical. Everyone knows about Corbets Couloir but the Alta Chutes, Tower 3 Chute, Expert Chutes provide in boundary steeps and there are another 3000 acres out of bounds. The views are spectacular, on mountain dining varied but all good. One tip, if you are on a budget, stay in Jackson and take the one of the shuttles. We stayed at the Elk Country Inn and took the shuttle every day. Door to door is 30 min. and FREE. Won't even bother with a rental car next time. Another tip: The Alpenhof Lodge has a $15 breakfast buffet with coffee, tea, right across from the tram --- take the 8am shuttle, have a nice b'fast and be on line for the first tram or gondola up."
170,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2017 , Friends,"Somerville, NJ ",Challenging mountain,"This is a serious ski mountain. If you're looking for challenge this is the place. Beautiful scenery, great people - on first trip go out with a ski host to show you around - well worth it."
171,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2017 , Friends,"Kaysville, UT ",Finally Skied The Hobacks,"I've gone up to Jackson Hole every year for quite some time now but haven't ever had the snow to be able to get over into The Hobacks. This trip was a dream come true - tons of fluff - and the Hobacks delivered....BIG TIME! Jackson Hole is truly a skier's mountain and being a ""skier"" I am in love with the place. We got one great day and one EPIC day and then a storm blew over 17 power transmission lines and JHMR lost all it's power. All-in-all we had a fantastic trip this year and although Jackson Hole doesn't need my endorsement - they have it."
172,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2017 , Friends,"East Northport, NY ",Check list,"Had it on my list for years and went back again this year...can't get enough  Tram, views, terrain, steeps (lots of), powder, vibe"
173,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2017 , Friends,"Hayden Lake, ID ",A skiers mountain,"Well groomed, long steep runs will keep you challenged. We couldn't find much powder since it had all been skied out. Plenty of runs for intermediate skiers as well."
174,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2017 , Couples,Arkansas ,Nice ride on the Tram,"We took the tram to the top of Rendevous Mountain to take some photos while in Jackson. It was cold, windy and snowing on top of the mountain but was fun. The waffles at Corbets Cabin smelled really good but we had already had breakfast."
175,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2017 , Couples,Pittsburgh ,Epic conditions at a phenomenal ski resort,"I've skied at JH a total of 5 times in the past 15 years, and this was arguably the best trip of them all. We had over 2' of snow during our 4 ski days and the conditions were ""refreshed"" every morning. The mountain is skewed towards better skiers/riders with some of the most difficult and intimidating runs you will encounter in bounds...and out of bounds is available if you are capable. There is the iconic Tram in addition to the 2 gondolas and multiple chairs. Skiing aside, the dining options at the top of the Bridger gondola are many, I recommend the asian noodle bowls, and apres ski at the classic Mangy Moose saloon. Truffle fries!    We always stay in the town of Jackson due to the multiple bar/restaurant/shopping options there, and its about a 20 minute drive up to the ski area...depending on traffic. Already thinking about heading back."
176,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2017 , Family,"Portland, OR ",Great View,"I don't know of a better view from anywhere else I have ever been. Ride the Tram to the top. Have a hot chocolate and a waffle and ski down. Oh, for the faint of heart, you can also ride the tram back to the base."
177,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2016 , Friends,"Boulder, CO ",Big Mountain Skiing,"The new tram makes getting to the top of this spectacular Mountain faster and reduces the wait time too. If you are a solid skier you will love getting up to Rendezvous on a powder day, This is an Epic experience. You do not have to be an ""Expert"" to handle Rendezvous Bowl, A strong Intermediate comfortable on steep terrain will be fine, Go with a guide or an intructor and make it memorable!"
178,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2016 , Family,"Oxford,Ms ",take advantage othe spectacular views,One of the best views in the U.S. Snacks and drinks are available at the top of the Mountian and the return ride is very exciting also !
179,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Friends,Europe ,Probably not something you'll see a local doing,It is surprising to read this activity as the 13th most popular thing to do in Jackson Hole. I've done it many times to ski but not in the summer just to ride up. The new tram is pretty cool and much faster than the old one and it's worth taking it to get right to the top of the world.
180,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2016 , Friends, ,Fun Tram Ride,"Unfortunately on the day we arrived there was some cloud covering the top of the mountain, the views on the way up however were amazing. At the top it was dense so we couldn't see much but didn't want to waste the journey so headed to the waffle house! Here I had the BEST hot chocolate and waffle ever so I would highly recommend them."
181,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2016 , Friends,new york- usa ,nice ride,We went in September which was a good time of year to go with daylight savings time still in effect.
182,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Pass Christian, MS ",SOOO MUCH FUN,"We came here in September and took the tram to the top. Took in the views and hung out at the waffle restaurant/bar and bought some souvenirs. I loved going up to 10,450 feet! We also saw a black bear on the mountain from the tram!"
183,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Ocala, FL ",Amazing Trip Up the Mountain,"We purchased all day tram tickets in the morning and immediately took a trip up the mountain. Along the way the views of the valley were spectacular.    As we neared the top of the mountain, we entered a cloud and when we emerged, the mountain was covered with snow and conditions were blizzard-like.    We immediately took the tram back down and returned to our hotel in order to ""layer-up"". We returned to the top and mountain and enjoyed snow drifts and waffles at the mountain-top restaurant."
184,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Sarnia, Canada ",Amusement park ?,"When seeing the Tram, Chairlift and Gondola the first impression was that this is an oversized Amusement park. Afetr taking the rides we appreciated the difference. The view and the flora at the hig elevations were fantastic !"
185,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Hartford, CT ",wow,Amazing views. Great place to hike. Weather was perfect but can change quickly. Everyone was so nice in the village.
186,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2016 , Couples,Central PA ,great views!,"Even though there were some puffy clouds in spots up top, I loved our visit up this mountain. The tram ride was fine - a little bumpy at a couple tower junctions which seemed to worry some riders, but not enough to cause any great concerns. The views were wonderful! They had had about 4 inches the night before, which the sun had melted where we were, but traces were still visible on higher peaks.It was chilly, but the sun made it quite nice. But the time we arrived the waffle kitchen was closed for the day :(. In mid September, the shops were closed, so nothing else to see."
187,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Milton, MA ",Breathtaking views,"This mountain is over 10,000 vertical feet high. The views were amazing fro. The top. Well worth checking out."
188,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Middletown, DE ",Nice Views,"I bought the tickets for the tram online at a small discount. The tix were good for 7 days from the date I placed on the purchase, which gave us flexibility. The tix were also good all day the day we chose to go, so we could travel the tram as often as we wanted. We went up and found ourselves in a cloud, which ruined the views but was a unique experience. Had lunch at the base and went back up to sunny skies and strong winds. Great views. Hiked a ways on some of the trails. In September wear a coat (and hat and maybe gloves). We bought some waffles for a snack at the top, which were good."
189,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Sheffield, UK ",Fantastic views from the summit,Not a lot to do at the summit in midsummer but well worth a trip to the top to take in the spectacular views.  We had an interesting ride in the cable car with a very informative guide and a large Amish family  Ride is quite expensive at $34 dollars each but worth the experience
190,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2016 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Holy moly was the summit windy.,Awesome tram ride to the top. A little pricey but the views are amazing. 50 degrees and wind that knocks. You over. It was June and cold- bundle up!

Enjoy a waffle at the top....they are the best! Not a lot to do up there but enjoy the views and a waffle/drink but it's well worth the tram up there.
193,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Manukau, New Zealand ","Wow, What A Spectacular Tram Ride!","We drove into Teton Village from the visitor centre at Moose. The village is full of classy looking hotels then there is the aerial tram that summits Rendezvous Mountain. The ride climbs just over 4,100 vertical feet and in mid June, has you walking around on a ridge with snow drfts still lying around.    The views are wonderful and short walk options are pleasant.    Don't expect any food of consequence on top, but your tram ticket gives you access to the main chairlift nearby which climbs over 2,000 feet to a building that serves really nice sandwiches / rolls for lunch and a beer! We did both rides and really recommend this attraction - great views over Jackson Hole and the Teton Range."
194,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2016 , Family,"Snoqualmie, WA ",one of the best,"I have skied all over the west and Jackson hole is among the best. Famed for it's steep terrain, but there is great skiing for intermediates and even beginners. The village continues to get larger and more interesting, so there is more to do apre."
195,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2016 , Family, ,A must!,"Free gondola ride after 4:30 takes you to a patio where you can enjoy a glass of wine and the gorgeous view. Wear pants and a jacket because it was very chilly up there even in August.    Dinner inside, at Piste, was so good we went back for my daughter's 20th birthday."

198,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2016 , Couples,"South Bend, Indiana, United States ",Worh the view,"Take the time to do Rendezvous Mountain. We took the tram up to the top. The view from 10,460 ft is breath taking. The view of the valley floor is a neat view from up on top of the mountain. You can either take the tram back down or hike down from the top. During the summer time there are no activities to do at the top but to take in the view, hike or you can parasail off the mountain. Worth checking out."
199,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2016,not available,"Elmhurst, IL ",Must see,Must see stop on a trip to Jackson. The view of the Tetons and Jackson Hole is breathtaking. We went in July and the weather was perfect. While at the top I made an impromptu decision to pay for a ride down the mountain on a parachute!
200,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2016 , Family,"Rigby, ID ",Super fun day at the mountain resort!,Super fun at Teton Village. We hiked up as a family this past week and than we surprised the kids and we were riding the tram down! They had no idea because we teased them the whole way up about the people that got to ride on the Tram as it kept passing over our heads with yet another load. They were on top of the world literally. Great Views. Great food at the gondola dock. Awesome patio to take a break on the way up. Long hike up to 10000 ft but so worth the effort with the family. Ride was the best after that climb!
201,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2016 , Friends,"New York City, NY ",Fantastic View!,Visited with friends end of May. Just reopened after ski season so quiet. Stunning clear day with snow at the top not too cold. Walked around then had a fabulous hot chocolate in the log cabin. Just what was needed. Beautiful views of Tetons and snake river valley. Nice easy trip in the tram even saw a moose on the way down. Great way to spend a few hours.
202,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2016 , Family,"Chestertown, MD ",Ride the Tram to the Top,"Our family of 11 adults and children (ages 15 to 4 1/2) loved the Tram ride up Rendezvous Mt. We all had waffles at the cabin on the top and then did the Cirque trail (2.1 miles) to the Bridger Teton gondola down. Our teen grandkids and their dad hiked down the whole mountain and then we all road the Tram again to the top (the ticket is good for the day). Great views and lots of trail options from the top. The Cirque trail was too hard for the younger children, but we all made it and felt we'd accomplished something together. Look for $5 off coupons around Teton Village or at the visitors centers. Coupon is good for the whole group."
203,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2016 , Family,"Charleston, SC ",Breathtaking view,"A quick tram ride to the top of Rendezvous Mountain, and you are on top of the world! At least as far you can get without climbing. The air is crisp and clean - you can see for miles in all directions. You marvel at what has been carved out of the earth, and you wonder how in the world people ski down in one piece! The staff is very helpful, the hot chocolate is real. Well worth the time and effort."
204,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Port Charlotte, FL ",Best value in Jackson,"Be sure to book your tickets on line at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort and pick them up at the will call office at the base of the tram. Significant discount. Tickets were good for three lifts all day. We enjoyed the Bridger cars as much as the tram, but the views from the top off the mountain off the tram can't be beat. Well worth the trip."
205,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Hawley, MN ",Beautiful,We visited the Teton Village and road both the tram and the gondola. It was off season but very beautiful. Don't order milk at the cabin at the top of the tram. It is extremely over priced at $5 for less than 8 oz.

We took the aerial up and hiked along the trails. Stunningly beautiful. Bathrooms located at the top of the mountain & the opportunity to buy drinks & something to eat.
207,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2016 , Friends,Utah ,"Eat Waffles at 10,000+ Feet","The Tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain is something every visitor to Jackson should do at least once. $42 gets you an all-day unlimited pass for an adult during summer season to ride the tram, the gondola, and the Teewinot chair lift. The tram ride is smooth and quick. There are benches for those that don't want/can't stand for the whole trip up the mountain. Once at the top there are several hiking trails to choose from ranging from short and sweet to difficult. If you don't want to hike just get a waffle or a beer at Corbet's Cabin (I like the trad - butter/brown sugar) and take in the views from the deck. It can be pricey, especially for families, but there are discounts for groups and for booking online. If you forget to book online there are tons of vouchers around town for $5 off the price of the tram pass. If you're really on a budget, hike up...you get a free ride down if you do."
208,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2016,not available,"Des Moines, IA ",Just the tram up is an adventure,"Hold on to you hat. Strong winds, but fantastic view. Minimal food and beverage, but some break from the wind. We did as part of a family pass, which was cost effective."

211,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2016 , Family,"Colleyville, TX ",Take the tram up,We rode up in the huge tram that fits 100 people. It was a beautiful view and worth the $. Spent some time at the top making a few snow balls (in June!) and walking around the top of the mountain.

I rode the original tram almost 30 years ago and knew my family had to see this view !!"
216,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2016 , Family,"Nebraska City, NE ",Tram ride to the top of the mountain is great,This is an expensive attraction but if your budget can handle it you must do this. The ride up to the top of the mountain is very smooth and the views are spectacular. When you get to the top of the mountain you see mountains all around you and the town of Wilson below.
217,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Knoxville, TN, ",Great view after tram ride,"This mountain is over 10,000 feet in elevation. It is a great tram ride from the 6000 foot base in Teton Village. From there you can see for miles all over the valley. There is a restaurant at the top."
218,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2016 , Couples,"Cleveland, OH ",Stunning Views,"The enjoyable Tram Ride to the 10,450 foot snow covered peak reveals numerous views of the valley, Tetons and Jackson Lake area. Standing at summit is the best view. Budget about 1 hour."
219,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Family,"Portsmouth, UK ",Good snow,Interesting and slightly challenging mountain with some very good snow while we were there  Most runs are intermediates with some very hard blacks that have never seen been bashed  Overall it was a good mountain
220,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Family,United States ,One of the best mountains I've ever skiied,JH Rendezvous Mountain is fab. The one thing i'll say is that you need to be a good skier to take advantage of the whole mountain. Since we visited in Late March it got warmer in the afternoon so we stayed up top on the mountain. this area doesn't have a lot of easy slopes.
221,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Redding, CA ",Top notch terrain,"When you get off the tram you are warned that only experts should proceed. I am not sure that it is entirely true, an intermediate should be just fine with common sense. I love the terrain and options. Can't wait for next year!"
222,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Family,"Boston, MA ","Beautiful mountain with challenging skiing, great western vibe","We skied here for the first time here for four days in early March. Although it was spring skiing conditions, we thoroughly enjoyed the terrain and the experience. Lines were minimal, lifts were efficient, and the trails varied. Because there wasn't fresh powder while we were there, we stuck mostly to groomers that were double blues, but loved the atmosphere and would love to come back and ski with some fresh powder. Our son skied the more challenging cliffs and woods and would also highly recommend this place."
223,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Family,"Cypress, TX ",Fresh powder !!!,"We rode the tram up just to view the mountain and watch skiiers make their way down. Visibility was not great, but still enjoyed the beauty of fresh snow in the mountain"
224,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016,not available,"Reston, VA ",Something for everyone,"Jackson Hole is a ski area you'll never get tired of. I have been returning year after year for a week or two of skiing since 1999. The first few days were pretty intimidating. They don't make slopes this steep or BIG in the East!  The novice skier will find plenty of gentle groomers on the Teewinot/Apres Vous part of the mountain. As you work your way south, there are more intermediate trails from the Casper and Bridger Gondola lifts. Experts will find more challenging terrain on the Thunder, Sublette and Tram lifts. Almost all of the lifts have at least one intermediate route down the mountain if you want to bail out and follow a cat track down. The exception is the tram, which is for expert skiers only. I found that it helped to have someone along who knows the mountain for your first few trips. Hazards and cliff areas are pretty well marked but experience will help your confidence..  Jackson added the Teton lift this year, between Casper Bowl and Apres Vous. A great high speed quad to make the Crags terrain and upper Moran woods accessible.  I also recommend loading the JHTapped app to your smart phone. It has helpful information on the trails, lifts and mountain facilities AND it has a GPS tracking function to record and play back your runs each day. Pretty cool.  I waited in no lift lines in the second week of March. Even the tram was pretty much a walk on without wait."
225,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Friends,"London, UK ",Not as scary as they make out,"The actual Jackson hole mountain range, first day up in the tram was a bit of a dream come true and brought out a massive smile, after ten on a snowboard im glad i went but wouldnt really go back. it was superb and loved it but we virtually skied it to death, its not as big as it seems, we got right to the edge of the hogback and still made it to the other side of the range on the same day, whistler its not, in and out the trees was good when the snow would allow as was most of the off piste bits, weather was very changeable and made it interesting, overal a challenge but theres better"
226,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Family,"Billings, MT ",Skiing at it's best.,Love skiing at this resort. The snow this time round was a bit challenging but spring skiing can always be interesting. Lift prices have gotten somewhat out of control at $130 per day. We packed our own lunch to save money for better dining experiences at dinner in town. Enjoyed having beers at the Mangy Moose after skiing. Kind of a Jackson staple.
227,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Chamonix, France ",10 years and counting,We've been skiing here regularly for 10 years now initially from the uk and now we drive down from whistler. The skiing is sensational and the views peerless. Great steep skiing in the trees. We usually have a few lessons when we're there and if you're an expert skier you'll get some great instruction from guys like Matty Lettick and Sam Sturgeon in the group lessons. Can't wait to get back and ski this hill again next year.
228,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Thayne, WY ",Breathtaking views from the top of the tram!,"We took time out from skiing to ride the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain. (The runs off the summit are beyond our skill level.) Loading the tram is something of a cattle drive, but the ride up and the views from the summit are worth the time and cost. There's a little restaurant at the summit with a limited menu, but the views are fantastic! Highly recommended!"
229,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Business,New York ,The Best Ski Area in North America,"Jackson Hole is like no where you've been before. For expert skiers, I believe that there is no better place. The Aerial Tram is the best lift in America rising 4,139' in 2.4 miles offering expert terrain that is unparalleled. From Corbet's Couloir, (Google It) to Tower 3 Chute, to the Expert Chutes and the Alta Chutes you experts will experience some challenging runs. And if you're really adventurous, get a guide, head out of bounds to the south and ski, Zero G, Spacewalk, Puckerface, 4 Shadows, No Shadows, Once is Enough or Twice in Nice. Did I mention als you could head west and north and ski The Horseshoe, Mile Long Couloir, Endless Couloir or Airforce Couloir? And for the Intremediates, there's over 1,000 acres of terrain just for you. So what are you waiting for???"
230,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Couples,deland ,Stunning,"First of all I don't ski (Florida girl life). this mountain was impressive. We took the tram to the top. We waited about 30 min to get on. It takes up 100 people at a time and worth every penny for the amazing view of the mountain and surrounding valley, I was stunned by how big it was and the jaw dropping views. At the top you can get waffles! at 10,460 ft it was 11 degrees and snowing hard. The staff and ski patrol were super nice. They almost had me but I have a bit of a phobia of falling off high places but this mountain made me want to ski. It looked amazing."
231,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Couples,"Charlotte, NC ","15"" of fresh powder","We skied for 3 days and enjoyed many runs on this challenging mountain. The highlight for us was having lunch at the new Piste restaurant. Delicious menu like a baby kale salad, Bbq sliders, and chicken sandwich with a creamy ajus for dipping. Very fresh and several healthy choices to choose from."
232,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Cleveland, OH ",Loved the powder!!,Awesome skiing! I loved every minute of it :) so many trails and options for every level of skier and snowboarding!!! Stay at the resort! It's worth the money and that way you can wake up and go right to the slopes!!
233,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2015 , Family,"Sombor, Serbia ",Snow mountain with a lot of ski loops,"If you like to skiing this is the place for it! It is a 4,5 qu.mil. of ski loops. Everyday is diferent! They offer sports chops and hotels and restaurants vith very good food!"
234,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Friends, ,Cafeteria at top of gondola,Simple good food in a relaxed setting. Good for skiers who want to sit down for a bite and sightseers who don't want fancy.
235,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Couples,"West Orange, NJ ",I have a new favorite ski area,"This is an amazing place. They have a vast variety of terrain for intermediate and expert skiers (but not much for beginners). Even without any snow during the week and spring (freeze/thaw) conditions, they did a good job on the groomers. More fresh snow would have helped the off-piste areas, but that is up to Mother Nature."
236,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Family,"Centreville, MS ",Family vacation,Ride the team to top to eat a waffle at Corbets Cabin. Beautiful views. The waffles were very good. A must see and do
237,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Family,"Palo Alto, CA, ",Best Skiing and Remarkable Views,"Rendezvous Bowl is at the top of Rendezvous Mountain. This has to be the best bowl skiing in the United States. It is HUGE and STEEP and the condition of the snow is almost always superb. One of my best ski experiences was skiing this bowl with my son and stopping at what felt like 30 feet DIRECTLY above him. Wow! In addition to the snow, the views on a clear day are awesome. You see the entire mountain range north and south. Take a look:"
238,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2016 , Friends,"Washington, DC ",Fantastic three days of blue bird skiing,"Beautiful mountain, efficient tram, gondola and lift system, and overall vibe make for some of the best skiing around. Hands down, JH edges out all other ski areas in Colorado and Utah. Can't wait to go back and bring more gal pals to enjoy this great mountain."
239,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Highland Village, TX ",Gorgeous views of the valley,"We chose to just ride the Aerial Tram for the experience, views and to enjoy waffles at the top of Rendezvous. We went on Sunday, January 31st and got in line for the tram around 11am. It took 45 minutes in line just to get on the tram, so be prepared for that. We couldn't see a thing going up because we were packed in like sardines with 100 skiers but the trip down was beautiful. Snow cleared at the top of the mountain long enough for us to see beautiful peaks and watch skiers drop down the mountain. Corbet's Cabin is truly like a tiny little cabin with only a few tables for diners so we ended up sharing a table with skiers already there; wish it was larger and truly more of a restaurant with large windows to enjoy the location. Fun, but be prepared for the wait for the tram and understand that the cabin is a tiny little place with no views."
240,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2016 , Friends,"Gunnison, CO ",Blower pow!,"Steep, deep, and fabulous terrain and views. The lifts are first rate and ski patrol is fabulous! The warming houses are modern with yummy cafeteria food as well as first class dining rooms available. Bridget gondola has views of cornets coulier"
241,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2016 , Family,"Raleigh, NC ",It's a must-do!,"If you are an avid skier - or just like to ski in amazing places, you really have to try this! There is no view quite like it. The skiing is wonderful. I also find that you don't wait in lines compared to mega-colorado resorts - even during busy times!"
242,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2016 , Solo,"Woodstock, IL ","Thrill seekers, go here","Many have already written about the challenging nature of this mountain. It's all true. That's why I like to stop at Corbet's Cabin and grab a coffee and scotch before dropping in. It's the best way to hit the wind driven, white-out brutality that I experienced a week ago Friday. Sure, you could just take the big red tram back down. But why not ride your board blindly in deep powder, with no idea where you're going? Best to hit this run with buddies, especially in blizzard conditions."
243,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2016 , Couples,"West Palm Beach, FL ",3 Days of Snow,Not only a fantastic ski destination but we had perfect conditions. Over 20 inches of snow fell while we were there. The lifts are efficient and the mountain felt big even on the busiest of days. It's not a place for beginners but there are plenty of blues for us intermediate skiers.
244,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL, ",Deserved Reputation for Steepness,"A great American ski mountain. Few mountains have so many runs with such consistent steep pitch. With the recent addition of the high speed Teton lift and the replacement of Casper with a high speed quad, the mountain is eminently more skiable. Unfortunately, the Marmot, Thunder, and Sublette lifts are still old and slow. On a cold day, it can get really cold.    The Rendezvous restaurants have been given an up-grade. The Piste Mountain Bistro is delicious and not expensive. The cafeteria has great higher end offerings ( for a ski resort), though they do not meet the standards of the Sundeck at Aspen.    There is a great beginners area but not really that much for a moderate intermediate. If you're a good skier, by all means visit this mountain."
245,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2015 , Family,"Boynton Beach, Florida ",Beautiful vistas and some challenging runs.,"Rendezvous Mountain has a little something for everyone. First, it's the best view of the Jackson/Wilson area that you can access with mechanical help, so you won't be disappointed there. The ski runs go pretty much from advanced to expert. If you're looking for a place to learn this is not that place, but if you know your way around and down a mountain, Rendevous Mountain is great. The concessions up mountain are not great. If you're looking for something hot to eat or drink you are much better down mountain at one of many places in Teton Village."
246,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2015 , Couples,"Woking, UK ",Fantastic skiing,"Great resort with a fairly modern lift system and a excellent choice of runs to suit those across the whole spectrum of abilities many runs tree lined too which help when visibility is poor. My only criticism is that some of the signage was a bit indistinct, especially on the most difficult runs and one could end up having to navigate around cliffs (which were signed)"
247,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2016 , Couples, ,Advanced to expert skiers only...,"Skiing in Steamboat every winter growing up, we were excited to try Jackson Hole. We skied mainly blues and blacks in Steamboat and knew that Jackson was a harder mountain, but we thought we would do fine. Now, maybe Steamboat rates their trails harder than they actually are or Jackson underrates their trails, but this mountain is very steep. The blues are much harder than most blacks we skied in Steamboat. There isn't any long cruising blues to enjoy, and you will work on almost every slope. I could see how this mountain would be great fun for the expert skier, but it was not our style and will be returning to Colorado next year."
248,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2015 , Couples,"Montgomery, AL ","Even if you don't ski, take the tram to the top","Great way to spend part of the morning or afternoon on a clear day. Skiers can enjoy the runs and sightseers will be rewarded by the great views. Each tram carries 100 people to the top and everyone is crammed together but the ride up takes only about 10-15 minutes. If you're a sightseer, you'll have the tram all to yourself. Parking fees can be avoided by taking a shuttle ride from one of the remote parking areas if you don't mind being on someone else's schedule. Views from the top are spectacular."
249,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Quincy, FL ",Great place to start a hike.,"The views from the summit are spectacular. In 1988 we started a 5 day backpacking trip here and came out Paintbrush Canyon. Best hike of our lives. We also have day hiked down Granite Canyon to Teton Village, a long but worthwhile trip. An easy way to get in the high country without all the climbing that gets harder as we get older."
250,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Nassau, New Providence Island ",Must do activity!,We visited in the summer and rode the tram to the top. The views are amazing once you reach the top and provide some pretty great photos. It was fun to look for wildlife although we didn't see any. Try to do this on a clear day and you'll be able to see for miles.
251,Rendezvous-Mountain,Oct 2015 , Couples,"The Villages, Florida, United States ",The gondola ride is amazing,We stopped to ride the gondola and were not disappointed. The views are amazing and the shops at the base are fon. Make it a point to do this activity.
252,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Charlestown, IN ",A Tram Ride is a Tram Ride,"If you've ridden one tram, you've ridden them all. Not much at the top of the mountain - a couple of small buildings that served waffles, etc. The view was good but not worth the money paid to get to the top. We've ridden a lot of trams, so I guess I'm jaded. It was rather cold and windy at the top."
253,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Macungie, PA ",Great view,No lines. Took the tram to the top which was a lot of fun. Looked for wildlife along the way. Enjoyed the views from the top and also watched the paragliders! We also took a leisurely ride on the ski lift when we got off the tram.
254,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Friends,East Brunswick ,Awesome views,Great views and the waffles are delicious. The tram is cool if you have never ridden one before. Just be prepared for the much cooler temps at the peak.
255,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Kent, UK ",Rendezvous Mountain,"Quite an experience going up on the cable car. Gorgeous views to be had, and we managed to see a moose on our way down the mountain! Being from the UK we were unaware at how breathless the altitude can make you feel though if you're not used to it!"
256,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Madison, NJ ","Great views, great waffle","Worth taking the gondola to see the views. For some reason, the thin waffles the sell taste delectable at 10,000 feet altitude"
257,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Mason, OH ",Can't beat the view!,"Great 360º view of the Teton range. Dress in layers as it can be quite windy and chilly. Be sure to pop into Corbet's Cabin, a small cafe up there, to get one of their famous waffles or a cup of coffee with Jameson or Irish Cream :)"
258,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2015 , Family,wyoming ,Come and see for yourself have to try this ski resort out,Love to ski here slopes for all types of skiers nice friendly staff in restaurants by the lifts and the ski patrol is nice and helpfull
259,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Washington DC, DC ",Great place to hike,Took the tram up on day 1 in Jackson to help acclimate. The top is 10045 feet or so and it was good to do some work at altitude. Scenery is beautiful.
260,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2015 , Family,"Washington DC, DC ",Amazing views but freezing cold,"Amazing views of the Valley. Fun trip up the tram and we even saw some bears. We decided to after breakfast and it was an impromptu visit where I was not dressed appropriately. 60 degrees at the bottom of the mountain and 35 at the top of the mountain not counting the zipping winds. Note, we went September 5th. We only stepped off the tram for a photo and took the same tram back down."
261,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Solo,"Jackson, WY, ",High and wild,"This is a spectacular place. When I was 20, a friend took me West of here 6.25 miles to Moose Lake in the Jedediah Smith wilderness. I was amazed. Tiny Alpine flowers and watermelon snow and wonderful landscape captured my imagination. I moved here shortly after. In August i went from Teton pass to the top of the tram. From Rendezvous Peak to the ski area Summit, the terrain was invigorating yet easy. I enjoyed Nutella on a waffle and a free ride down. Thank you Jackson Hole Mtn Resort and Bridger Teton national Forest."
262,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Columbus, MS ",Best deal after 4:30,"The trip up Rendezvous Mountain is very nice. It was free after 4:30. We had a glass of wine and enjoyed the valley below,even though it was very smoky. There is a prix fix restaurant at the top. We didn't try it but the place looked packed."
263,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Family,"Braselton, GA ",Warm Place with a Great View,"On the rainy day we visited, the warmth was welcome. The smell of the famous waffles was in the air! While I did not have any, the hot chocolate looked and smelled wonderful."
264,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Family,"Sarasota, FL ",Paragliding off Rendezous...awesome!,"Paragliding in Teton Village off of Rendezvous Mountain was great! I had seen people doing it the last time I visited, but I was there for work so didn't have time to participate. On this trip, my two teenage sons, my sister and I all did it. I was a little nervous, but the tandem guides are awesome! John was my guide and put me at ease from the beginning. You can be as calm or daring as you want...just tell your guide. It was a great experience and I would do it again!"
265,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015,not available,"Minneapolis, MN ",Great way to see the top,"We booked tickets online, for a slightly cheaper price, and simply picked them up at the ticket window before our ride up. The tram is very smooth and a quick way to see everything from the top. We spent a few hours hiking around, enjoying a waffle, and taking pictures before heading back down."
266,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2015 , Family,"Tinton Falls, NJ ",Go to the Teton Village---,"The Rendezvous Mountain is at the Teton Village, and we loved the whole area! We ate lunch at the Mexican truck and it was delicious. The tram ride is a must!"
267,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2015 , Family,"Victoria, MN ",Tip if you are queezy about the height.,"Rode the aerial tram to the top. If you are worried, it wasn't so bad. Keep your eyes on the horizon on the way up and down. The sways at the towers was minimal. Waffles were good and small gift shop on top. The Gondola brings you to a different peak with a restaurant."
268,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2015 , Friends,South Carolina ,Great hike with amazing views,"The hike was for a novice to experienced climber. The summit was at 10,500 feet and had incredible views. There was a waffle house at the summit to replenish calories burned while hiking. Amazing!!"
269,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2015 , Family,"East Earl, PA ",Ski slope,"We took a ride up the ski slope. Even tho there wasn't any snow to ski on, the ride is still worth the taking."
270,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2015 , Family,"Fort Collins, Colorado, United States ",Fun place in the summer,"Lots to do for all ages. We have teen boys and we took the tram to the top of Rendezvous Mountain, had waffles, mountain biked through the trees and ate at the Mangy Moose. Only 3 minutes to Teton National Park! It is expensive, but then again, it is a ski resort."
271,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2015 , Couples,"Bellingham, WA ",The Myth,"Most completely and ridiculously overrated ski area anywhere. What little cruising terrain there is is policed by the Gestapo. Snotty, surly, incompetent staff. INSANELY expensive. Mediocre snow. If you have money to burn, can ignore the attitude and want to ski only expert terrain with skied-out powder at best, this is your place."
272,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2015 , Friends,"Columbia, MO ",Can't Imagine how pretty in snow,"High Altitude Beauty! We enjoyed our time in this area, lots of photos & a bit of hiking. Cannot imagine skiing this area...but then we've never skied."
273,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2015 , Family,"Chapel Hill, NC ",STUNNING hikes,"We took the gondola up to Rendezvous Mountain. It was around $85 for the whole family to ride up - the views at the top are stunning. We hiked about 2.5 miles across and down to the free tram. It seems like that'd be pretty simple, but the hike down is a bit more technical than expected with young kids. Doable but more challenging than expected. It was also very private when we hiked down, literally only saw one other couple the whole time we were out in the very beginning but didn't see them again. Seems like the whole mountain is yours. Got drinks at the end and then took the tram down - very fun and incredible sights the whole way."
274,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2015 , Family,"Fort Worth, TX ",Tram and Waffles!,A must do on each visit. The Tram ride offers excellent views of the Tetons and the waffles at the top are great!
275,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2014 , Couples,"Austin, TX ",Hike Up the Mountain. Reward Yourself with Waffles!,"This was my first time to hike up a mountain, and it was a great experience. We started early, around 7 am. It's a little challenging to find the entrance to the trail if you've never been, but once you get on the trail, it is pretty well marked the whole way up.    Below the tree line, expect switchbacks filled with flowers and breathtaking views. After the tree line, you'll be in more direct heat, so dress accordingly. Make sure to bring plenty of water, snacks and wear good hiking shoes.    Once at the top, the views are totally worth the trek. And the restaurant on top has Nutella waffles! Best reward... EVER! No wait, the best was being able to take the free gondola ride back down.    Overall, it was a great 4 hour hike."
276,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2015 , Couples, ,Awesome Views,"Thoroughly enjoyed our tram ride to Rendezvous Mountain. The views traveling up and down are just awesome. There was still snow on top of the mountain and it was a bit ""chilly"", but overall a great experience."

278,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2015,not available,"Jackson Hole, WY ",Summer wildflowers,"An amazing variety of alpine wildflowers are on the hillsides at the top of the tram. The best I've found are to the south of the tram along the trail/road down the hill. But, if you're having trouble with the altitude, be sure you remember that you've got to walk back up--it will certainly take your breath away. When the flowers start to bloom is different each year depending on when the snow melted off the top. Usually there are a lot in late June and into July."
279,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Petersfield, England, United Kingdom ",Excellent hiking trails,Some good high level trails available from the top of the cable car that runs every 15 mins. Mountain bikes also available for rental at the base of the mountain

281,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2015 , Couples,"Fort Myers, FL ",Worth a visit.,We spent a large part of an afternoon at the summit of Rendezvous Mountain after taking the tram to the top. A great vista and easy to do.
282,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2015 , Family,"Knoxville, TN ",Great summer views and yummy waffles.,"We took the aerial tram up to the top and walked around for a long time. There were fantastic views and just a little bit of snow left, even in late June. We had heard great things about the waffles and they did not disappoint. They were worth the wait and hit the spot after the hiking we did. Bring your camera, and a professional is available to take pictures of your family against some breathtaking backdrops."
283,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2015 , Family,"Columbus, OH ",Amazing view,"Absolutely breathtaking views! Take the tram ride up to the summit. You can see for miles from the summit. While you're at the summit, grab a waffle or two. They're made fresh there."

We spent the next couple of hours watching the para-gliders take off from the edge of the cliffs...enjoyed some waffles and coffee...and really just tried to take in the tremendous vistas.
286,Rendezvous-Mountain,Apr 2015 , Couples,"Marietta, GA ",great food,"We had our anniversary dinner here.. The waiter was very nice and even though my husband did not feel great, the waiter gave us a complimentary ginger ice sherbet to help. We were fortunate to e there for the buy one get one free dinners. I had Monk fish."
287,Rendezvous-Mountain,Apr 2015 , Family,"Buxton, UK ",Fantastic ski area for all abilities,"We visited from UK for the last week of the 2014/15 season and we were not disappointed. OK, the snow was thin in places but this is April!! We loved it. Lots of long, steep runs from the Gondola or steady blue and green runs from the mid-chairs. It's well worth the 20 hour journey for guaranteed snow, quiet slopes and no lift lines. Jackson Hole resort and Teton Village have everything you need for a fantastic ski holiday."
288,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2015 , Family,New Jersey ,Top of Gondola,"Food very expensive. If you have a ""j Ticket"" which is just a ride for gondola to meet skiers on top for lunch you will get a $10 credit for food. Nice selection. Veggie ""Hippie"" burger great."
289,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jan 2015 , Friends,"Glenolden, PA ",Awesome bowl. Only for the advanced skiers. But you can get back on the tram if you chicken out.,Grab a waffle and jump into the bowl. Make sure there's plenty of snow because it is very steep. The only thing is that's its very high and windy so be safe up there.
290,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2015 , Family,"Monmouth Beach, NJ ",The most exhilirating ski of a lifetime!,Don't try this if you're not a confident and skilled skiier! The view at the top is AMAZING & AWESOME! Bring your camera - and don't miss this photo shoot!!!! What an awesome mountain - unbelievable - it is really sick!
291,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2015 , Friends,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Different kind of ski mountain!,"I've skied here many times, most recently in February 2015. Most skiers are well aware of the challenges provided by RM, I think that it's the only place in North America where you can ski almost 5000 vertical feet of black diamond terrain in one continuous run. Famous runs include the Hobacks, Rendezvous Bowl, Tower Three Chute, Crags, Casper Bowl, Headwall & Corbet's (of course). What isn't well known is the fact that the resort has gone to great lengths to make RM accessible to all types of skiers, not just expert one's. The mountain staff does a good deal of grooming and makes a real effort to take out some of the area's rough edges. What has emerged is a more rounded ski area that can now be enjoyed by every stripe of skier, it's not just an expert's playground anymore!"
292,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2015 , Business,"Murfreesboro, TN ",WOW,"No matter what else you do, ride the tram to the top of the mountain and see this sight. It will take your breath away."
293,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2015 , Family,"Santa Monica, CA ",Tram to the top,The mountain is very beautiful. Lots of skiers and snowboarders. I'm not a skier but I definitely would recommend taking the tram to the top just for the view (and of course the delish waffles)
294,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2015 , Friends,"Bend, Oregon, United States ",Rendevous Mountain,"The highest point within Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, Rendezvous mountain is accessed by the aerial tram. This is a classic rocky mountain peak and the views are outstanding all year round (unless there is a storm and clouds). Well worth the trip."
295,Rendezvous-Mountain,Dec 2014 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",Epic View,"Not much to say except it has one of the best views anywhere around JH. We were able to see several tamdem paraglider jumps and that was pretty interesting, especially with the wind shear so high up."
296,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2014 , Couples,"Saline, Michigan ",Stunning,"Every time I get out of the tram at the top of Rendezvous Mountain, I have to stop to take in the view. It always spectacular. The view across the valley is stunning and the view back to Cody Bowl is always fabulous. After a new snowfall dumps snow on all the trees at the top it is almost magical especially if it is foggy. I've been going to Jackson Hole almost every for over 20 years  and I still find it special."
297,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Charleston, SC ",Breathtaking in more ways than one!,"The short ride on the tram brought us up to the top of Rendezvous Mountain ~ 10,500 ft. high. The 360 degree view of Jackson Hole and the Grand Tetons replete with several paragliders soaring above and among the peaks was breathtaking. So, unfortunately was the altitude for a couple who just arrived in JH, That said, I would not trade the experience. It was worth it AND I survived."
298,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Providence, RI ",I wish I were a skier!,"We went to Jackson Hole and visited Teton Village and Rendezvous Mountain. This place must be heaven for skiers; miles and miles of trails of varying difficulty, gorgeous hotels/condos/shops. There is a gourmet restaurant (which had closed by the time of our visit) located about 2/3 of the way up this mountain. We took the aerial tram up and I just kept thinking how absolutely beautiful this would be with the incredible snowfall that occurs there."
299,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2014 , Couples,"East Walpole, MA ",Tram up 10k feet,"Large tram holds 50+ people I believe. The view from the top is spectacular of Jackson Hole. However, it is cold and very windy."
300,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Weymouth, UK ",Walk Down the Mountain,"Our first hike in Jackson Hole was down Rendezvous Mountain. You can pick up the cable car at Jackson Hole and then walk back along the track which goes underneath the cable car. Cable car was quite expensive but you are rewarded with great views of the Grand Teton from the summit.  Walk takes about 3 hours, not difficult. Saw marmotte and deer along the route."
301,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Cordova, TN ",Take the paragliding trip down the mountain!,"We noticed the paragliders while on the Aerial Tram tour and on the spur of the moment decided to take the plunge! Our driver up to the launch site was very interesting and shared a lot of detail about the area on the way up. Our pilots were awesome and made us feel very, very comfortable and very safe. The photos are awesome. It's a memory we will never forget."
302,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2014 , Solo,"Greenville, SC ",Rendezvous Mountain,"Windy and thin air!! The ride up on the tram was great. There was a storm coming over the mountain, so we were advised to stay inside, but overall the views were great! A must do if you visit Jackson!"
303,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2014 , Friends,"Raleigh, NC ",Tram Ride,"Sweet view from the top. Bundle up, it gets cold even in summer!!!! The gondola had food, but tram only has waffles but they are pretty good!"
304,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2014 , Couples,Illinois ,Ride the Tram to the restaurant,We rode the free tram (from 4:30-6 pm) and went to the restaurant at the top. There was a live band playing and you could get drinks and appetizers. It was so much fun and you get the most incredible view of everything below.
305,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2014 , Business,"Athens, OH ",Exciting Overlook,"We took the tram to the the top of rendezvous Mountain for the amazing views of Grand Tetons National Park. The tram itself is very comfortable. it goes up and down the mountain every 15 min. You can stay as long as you like and travel back down at your convenience. There is a small place on the top of the mountain that you can grab something to drink or eat waffles (that is the only food they offer). There are also some hiking trails you can walk. The ticket is way over priced ($35/person) for the view but it is one of those things that you have to do, so they know you will pay it. It is a little more easy to swallow the cost when you find out that you can use your tram ticket to also get on the smaller gondola. We visited in August and this gondola was being used for sightseeing and to take your mountain bike up the mountain for an exciting ride down. (I'm glad we took the tram first and found this out or we would have been mad about paying for 2 different tickets). (Mountain bikes can be rented at the resort). Even though it was summer when we went, I would definitely recommend wearing pants and at least a windbreaker as the winds are very cold at the top."
306,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2014 , Friends,"Saint Louis, MO ",Very Safe - rain -hike to the Deck,"If ride the tram - get tickets online to save $5. We were so disappointed that we didn't get to spend but maybe 15 minutes on top of the mountain. Several storms were rolling in from the back side of the mountains. Finally the tram crew agreed to take up one more group but really wanted us to come straight back down. Since the rained had stopped they let us get off in time to grab a waffle (don't bother unless really hungry) and look around. We were informed that if we didn't take the tram down we may be stuck up there or have to walk the 7.6 miles down the mountain. We obeyed and glad we did since we went into the Mangy Moose Bar/restaurant and within a few minutes a bad storm with strong winds and hard rain came down obscuring the whole mountain. So if you our worried about the tram ride don't be. The staff controlling the tram were super nice and safety came first. We even had a person whose asthma was acting up and they talked very sweet with her and told her they couldn't guarantee she would do well on top and that they just used up the last of their oxygen on top with another lady who they had just made an emergency run to bring her down to the waiting ambulance. We had friends that went up earlier that day when it was sunny and decided to walk the 3 mile hike to The Deck. The got lots of sun, got hailed on once, rained on twice and a little scared towards the in. They said the trail was wide, loose rock on a gravel road but if you are not accustom to the altitude you probably shouldn't do and make sure no matter the weather when you start out take your rain coat and plenty of water. Say the last part of the hike is all up hill so be in decent shape."
307,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2014 , Couples,"Grass Valley, CA ",Grand Teton Music Festival,"At the base of Rendezvous Mtn. is the Walk Music Festival Hall, the site of the Grand Teton Music Festival which takes place for 7 weeks in July and August. Tuesday through Saturday evenings there are wonderful classical music concerts with top notch musicians from all over the US, with all the principals being principals in their home orchestras. We were blown away by our first visit there this year and will make it an annual visit. Before the concert at 8:00 (6:00 on Saturdays) we took the free tram to The Deck atop Rendezvous Mountain for a delicious light supper. It's a 15 minute ride so you can plan your arrival for the concert perfectly."
308,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2014 , Family,Mexico City ,"""Glad we went""","I had been investigating things to do in the Jackson area and knew this was high up on the list. We (dad, mom and two boys) took the tram to the top mid morning. Be advised it is worth it to take a light jacket or sweatshirt, because of the temperature drop at the top, and it can get windy. Enjoyed the ride and the views were spectacular! Check on the family rate which does offer a discount off the regular rate."
309,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2014 , Family,Florida ,It was fun and safe,Summer trip. Safe and fun. Lots do do with or without kids. Very touristy. Opportunity for respite from the mountains with high end cocktails at the Four Seasons Hotel bar.
310,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2014 , Family,"Middle Island, NY ",Jumping off the mountain,"My 3 sons and 2 grandsons went parasailing off Rendezvous Mountain tandem with an instructor. It was a great experience for all of them, pricey but an unforgettable adventure."
311,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2014 , Family,"Orland Park, IL ",Amazing views,"We visiting GTNP every summer and have never ventured far from the park. This year we went all the way down Moose Wilson road and found Rendezvous Mountain. We decided to take the tram up and check it out. It was costly but it was fun. The views were amazing from up on top. We enjoyed watching the paraglyders. The waffles on the top of the mountain were delicious! We saw a few marmots on top. Our only disappointment was that there was still so much snow. We had wanted to take the tram up and hike down the mountain. Most of the trails were closed so we were unable to hike down. Although when we inquired at the top with the employee that you were told to go to with any questions, we didn't know that the trails were closed due to snow. We asked him how to start and where to start the trail to go down the mountain. He told us the trails are closed due to heavy snow. But he also said that it is a National Park and we are free to go anywhere we want to. He then proceeded to show us where the trail starts and how to get down. He told us to just go under the rope that says trail closed. Now just so you know, we have visited NP's very often and enjoy hiking but in no way did we look like experienced hikers that could navigate down a closed snowy trail. I am pretty sure the employee would have been terminated if his bosses knew he told us what to do. It was a good thing that we had common sense to NOT go down the trail."
312,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2014 , Couples,"Kauai, HI ",Great view,we went all the way up to the mountain on the tram ride....we saw a brown bear while go up the tram.
313,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2014 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",best views around in any season,You can't beat these breath taking views and the entire experience. The tram conductors are fun and informative. Ask any questions about the area and they seem to know the answers.
314,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2014 , Family, ,Tram ride was awesome,Took the tram up the mountain - so amazing! The ride up takes about 12 minutes and the views rom the top are just breathtaking! Totally worth the money!
315,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2014 , Couples,"Montour Falls, NY ",Great views for the top,"Loved the view from the top! Aerial tram took us up 10,450 feet and it was well worth the $35/person cost of the ride. Might not be good for rambunctious little kids. No railings to prevent them from falling off the mountain. If you're afraid of heights, this isn't for you!"
316,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2014 , Friends,"Dallas, TX ",Best mountain around,"Hands down best mountains I've ever skied on! Runs for all levels. Great views, atmosphere, and plenty to keep you busy!"
317,Rendezvous-Mountain,Mar 2014 , Family,"Seven Valleys, PA ",Excellent,Went to ski and had a blast. We went for a week in March and for a warm week the conditions were wonderful! Tough mountain but that's why people love it
318,Rendezvous-Mountain,Feb 2014 , Friends,"Washington DC, DC ",Couldn't see anything,But it was worth the adventure. We got to the top of the tram and there were 60mph winds and snow blowing everywhere. Complete white out conditions are not for the faint of heart. I wish it would have been calm and sunny but wheres the fun in that!!!
319,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2013 , Couples,"Fort Myers, FL ",TAKE THE TRAM! BEST VIEW EVER!,"Wow, what views. Great waffles, beer or hot chocolate! We had snow! Lucky us!! The ride to the top was worth the $54. Views of the Tetons, and the valley below was breathtaking. Don't miss this trip!"
320,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2013 , Friends,"El Sobrante, CA ",fast trip for a wonderful view.,"only took about 12 minutes to get to the top. get a full view of the valley and beyond. you can stay and hike around the trails, or ride back down. was a little pricey...but all trams are now."
321,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2013 , Friends,Texas ,Loved it,"We two couples rented from Rendezvouz Mountain Rentals and loved our 3 nights there. We were in Sarvisberry, at the back of the property on the second story outside unit. Great! The beds and linens and pillows were high-end and incredibly comfortable. I loved the heated tile floors!! We also saw a moose cow walking around. I'd stay there again in a heart beat."
322,Rendezvous-Mountain,Sep 2013 , Couples,"North Canton, OH ",Worth the cost of the tram ride!,"Dont forget your binoculars and cameras! After a short ride up to 10,000 some feet there are amazing views of the Tetons (depending on cloud cover) and the surrounding area. Many hiking trails that start from here - based on your physical ability. We just did the top of the world loop. Also, make sure to try one of the waffles if the Top of the World Waffles is open. They also offer beverages (hot,cold, and adult) as well as a small gift shop. Really enjoyed our time here. We did not see any animals on way up or down."
323,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2013 , Couples,"Lake Worth, FL ",Amazing views.,Rode the tram up here and it was literally awesome! Definitely worth the cost. Missed the waffles :( Others in our group said they were delicious.

325,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2013 , Couples,"Austin, TX ",Perfect start to a downhill hike!,"Tram up, hike down. A shuttle service is available - save the last few miles and use it! Beer at the Mangy Moose after is perfect!"
326,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2013 , Couples,"Foristell, MO ",You gotta try the waffles,How can you not try the waffles? I have never been up in the Tetons let along enjoy a ride up with a waffle. The Nutella waffle was cut into thirds we chowed down 2/3's of it and a lady chatting with us took the last 1/3 of the waffle. I LOVE America!
327,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2013 , Family,"Oronoco, MN ",Breathtaking views,"Getting to the top can be a little daunting if you are at all afraid of heights, but it is well worth the tram ride. The views are amazing all the way up. You can spend time at the top hiking or just enjoying the views. This is a must do while in Jackson Hole."
328,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2013 , Family,"Bettendorf, IA ",Very Beautiful!,"The tram going to Randezvous peak was great! Once on top of the mountain, it is breathtaking! Absolutely beautiful!!! You can stay as long as you like and can even eat up there. Beautiful site if you like mountains!"
329,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2013,not available,"Rehoboth Beach, DE ",Spectacular!,What a great way to start our visit to Jackson Hole--magnificent views on the way up and down. Will plan to hike down next time.
330,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jul 2013 , Friends,"Northbrook, IL ",Be Prepared,"The views from the tram are stunning. The view at the top is spectacular! Please remember that this altitude is very thin. It is cool, even in mid summer. Bring a sweater. Be prepared for shortness of breath. Take the stairs to the very top slowly. Don't go up the minute you reach Jackson, as I did. If I had waited a day at the lower level, before going I might have avoided a nasty headache. I am not an athlete, however I am in shape and exercise regularly. DO EAT A WAFFLE. I had the butter and brown sugar. YUMMY."
331,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2013 , Family,"Shepherdsville, KY ",WOW!!!,"If you do not do anything else, you must and I say must take the tram up the Rendezvous Mtn. One of the top or if not the top highlight of our trip to the area. Did not want to leave the Mtn.!!!"
332,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2013 , Family,"Doylestown, PA ",Stunning Views,The views from Rendezvous are breathtaking. Worth the tram ride. The cafe is great too with homemade waffles that are just delicious.
333,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2013 , Family,"Oklahoma City, OK ",Cold early in the mornings,Waffle w/nutella at the top was awesome. Bacon would be good on there too. Great views but it was very windy (30mph+) so plan for that.
334,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2013 , Family,"Ponte Vedra Beach, FL ",Amazing views,"We took the Tram up to the summit of Rendezvous Mountain and it was great. The 360-degree views of Jackson Hole from 10,450 feet were amazing. Make sure to take a jacket because it is windy and cool."
335,Rendezvous-Mountain,Jun 2012 , Couples,New York ,A long hike down !!!,"Took the tram up on June 21- look for coupons in brochures - and hiked the 7 miles down. There was quite a lot of snow at the top to hike through, then dry rocky area, then wildflowers, then forest and then jungle. We had seen a bull moose from the tram on our way up, and had bear spray along. For much of the trip we were all alone on the trails. I wore hiking boots that were well broken in but NOT for the constant shifting forward of downhill hiking and ended up with 9 blisters and may lose 2 toenails as a result of all the bumping against the front of my boot. Be sure to take along blister bandaids if you do this hike and be prepared for snow hiking at the top !!! Have plenty of water, food and bear spray and a hiking stick helps also."
336,Rendezvous-Mountain,May 2012 , Couples,"Austin, Texas ",Closed!,The tram wasn't open when we were there. It opened the day after we left! Check dates beforenyoungo.
337,Rendezvous-Mountain,Aug 2011,not available,"Jackson, Wyoming ",Top of the world,"The is the mountain that is served by the Jackson Hole Aerial tram. In the winter, you will get some of the best skiing in the country from the top of this mountain, and in the summer, it is great for sightseeing and hiking. Anytime of the year, when you get on top of Rendezvous Mountain, it feels like you are on top of the world!"
338,Rendezvous-Mountain,Oct 2011,not available,Santa Barbara ,A ride to the Top,"The views are spectacular from the Gondola in Teton Village the fall colors were just happening. Little restaurant at top didn't have much and it was lunch time, we didn't have the 4-5 hrs for the long walk down. Had lunch at the little restaurant at bottom of Mountain and it was quite good, salads were great and the chicken sandwich was delicious."
