370,Antler_Arches_of_Jackson,Aug 2017 , Couples,"San Antonio, TX ",Elk antler arches in Jackson WY,"The good news: No elk were killed in the making of these arches. Elk are in the deer family so they have antlers, not horns. They shed their antlers every year, no matter how large, and start over the next year. It's cows and other bovines which have horns.    In Jackson there is a Town Square Park in the touristy part of town and all four corners of the park have entrance arches made from elk antlers. That there is a National Elk Refuge just north of town guarantees an annual supply of antlers. I understand they are collected each year by the local Boy Scouts.    The bad news: We were there in summer and this park was very busy with tourists. Naturally, everybody wants their picture with the antlers so you have to wait your turn and duck in quick to get yours.    Fun thing to do. If you run a webcam seaarch you'll find there are at least two webcams overlloking the park. You can seem them on nearby buildings. So with a little planning you can call friends or family when you're there and wave at them when they jump online. We had fun watching four Japanese girls shrieking into their phones while waving like crazy at one of the webcams."
