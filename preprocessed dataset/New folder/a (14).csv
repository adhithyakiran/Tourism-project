0,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2022 , Friends,"Nashville, TN, ",A nice diversion when in Jackson hole,A nice little drive with the ability to look for big horn sheep and seeing elk. Friendly rangers. Pull offs for viewing. Make sure to pull off only where marked in the winter. Saw a car stuck in the snow from pulling off in the wrong area.

It was easy to sign up, the cost was reasonable, the shuttle out was nice, our driver was knowledgeable and made sure that all of our questions were answered. It was amazing to see the animals.......I HIGHLY recommend this experience!!!!!"
2,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2022 , Couples,"Kiawah Island, SC ",Great for wildlife enthusiasts,"We visited the refuge and took a sleigh ride to get closer to the elk.ourguide was great. It’s such an interesting place to view, photograph or drive around. Also visit the visitor center while there. There is some good information, an observation deck and a very nice gift shop"
3,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2022 , Friends, ,Great time,"Our tour guide, Lynn was fantastic! He was super knowledgeable and full of great information. We had an awesome experience!"
4,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2022,not available,Arizona ,Wished We Had Time To Go,"Odd to review a place we didn't actually get to, but we watched from across the road and saw the beautiful and plentiful Elk along with four Gray Wolves! It was incredible. The sleds stayed out there so people could get pictures and another group we were with who went previously said it was a fantastic. Something for the whole family!"
5,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2022,not available,"County Limerick, Ireland ",Get Up Close to the Elk,"Must take a sleigh ride to see the elk. Our driver Clint, exceptional. Come within 10 feet of a bull elk."
6,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2022,not available,"Birmingham, Alabama ",Nice Visit,Tour guide was wonderful. She was very engaged with our group. We were able to see plenty of Elk. The sled was nice pulled by the horses. It was bitterly cold that morning. Be prepared!
7,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2022 , Family,"Gonzales, TX ",Snowy day tour,It was snowing while we took our sleigh ride which just made it more fun. We saw beards of elk up close. Bulls and cows. The tour guide was knowledgeable and answered everyone’s questions well lots of chances for good pictures. Have to buy tickets at the Jackson hole visitors center and take a shuttle to get to the refuge. You can also park at viewing areas along the road and see them from further away.  I am told it’s best in the winter. In summer they migrate back into the mountains
8,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2021,not available,Mankato ,Up close viewing of the elk,Wonderful sleigh ride into the refuge. Our sleigh driver was very knowledgeable about the elk and the area. Would definitely recommend.
9,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021,not available,"Bartow, FL ",Cold but loved it,"First let me say, if you do not bring a blanket, please buy one. Not only does the money from the blanket sells help the refuge but you will definitely need that blanket. The sleigh ride is pretty bumpy. But we got really close to elk and loved every second"
10,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2021 , Solo,"Lafayette, LA ",Vacation,It’s a beautiful place and very nice drive in the refuge. There’s a few stops you can make. The ranch is closed to the public. A few markers with the info of the animals that take refuge there. There were no Elks in sight. So a little disappointing.
11,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2021,not available,"Rochester, MN, ",Wild Elk,Large refuge. Occasionally can see the elk from the highway when driving past. They reminded me of tame fenced in elk until I learned they are in fact wild but returning to the area to be fed.
12,National_Elk_Refuge,Jul 2021,not available,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL ",Unremarkable,WE didn't see any elk here but saw many driving 1000 miles from Jackson to Cody & throughout Yellowstone.
13,National_Elk_Refuge,Jul 2021,not available,"San Diego, CA ",Herds of elk and bison on parade,"Impressive animals. Plan to start before dawn. Establish a route to include the reserve, Signal Mountain, Jenny Lake and other attractions. To ensure you cover the best and get educated, hire a guide (Team 399 and Jack Bayles did a fine job for our family),"
14,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2021,not available,"Bakersfield, CA ",Didn't see elk behind the high fence.,"High-fenced enclosure (mostly to protect them from highway traffic). Didn't see any elk, but the area behind the fence is a marshland with lots of waterfowl to view."
15,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2021 , Family,"Indiana, PA ",Wrong time of the year,We visited at the end of June and saw one mule deer. Apparently the elk more into the park in the warmer months. We were told best time to view is winter months.
16,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2021,not available, ,No Elk,We drove past the refuge atleast 2 times a day for 8 days. We never saw an elk even in the distance with binoculars.
17,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2021,not available,"Port Charlotte, FL ",Not Much to See,We drove the dirt road through the National Elk Refuge in hopes of seeing wildlife. It seems that most of the animals had moved to higher pastures to escape the heat and pesky insects. We did get to see a small herd of Big Horn Sheep who were grazing along the roadside. I'd recommend this trip in colder weather.
18,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2021,not available, ,Disappointed,We spent 3 days in this area and most of the elk were too far away to really see. Better views in GTNP.
19,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2021,not available, ,"convenient, some wildlife","Saw mountain herd of sheep, lone juvenile elk, three elk chasing coyote. Drove to very end of dirt rode, stopped and watched. It was just 5 minutes from Jackson hotel."
20,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2021,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",great and easy place to visit,I did not see elk - but we did see sheep. It is right next to Jackson Hole so you can't miss it and it is worthwhile.
21,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2021 , Couples,"Pasadena, MD ",Near our place,Saw rams and elks and beautiful view . A picture view that looks like should be in pictures of the Grand Tetons
22,National_Elk_Refuge,Apr 2021 , Couples,"Prosper, TX ",You can drive around the back side.,We happened upon a rear entrance of the Refuge which produced excellent wildlife viewing opportunities of elk and big horn sheep.
23,National_Elk_Refuge,Apr 2021,not available, ,Best up close elk experience of our trip,"We got the closest to the elk with this tour versus our longer, more expensive wildlife tour. Our guide was great with lots of knowledge of the area and the elk. Take a trip before March if you want to see the elk with horns though."
24,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2021,not available,"Kinmundy, IL ",Elk Up Close and Personal,"When there is snow on the ground, it's a sleigh ride. When the ground is exposed, it's a wagon ride. Either way, it's enjoyable. A cowboy drives ticket holders on a comfortable bus from downtown Jackson Hole to the refuge. Cowboys and Cowgirls drove teams of horses through the refuge, stopping close to the herd for photo ops and lots of information about elk. This is a good way to be close to wildlife while being safe and not disturbing them."
25,National_Elk_Refuge,Apr 2021 , Family,"Victoria, MN ",Drive through and saw moose & elk,"This was a nice drive through the refuge. We could see that the sleigh ride option did get people closer to the Elk, but we were able to see the animals from a distance. Some people were biking and walking along the road, or stopped to take pictures."
26,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2021 , Couples,"Nashville, TN ",Family-run tour + sneak peek into the refuge operations,"The wagon ride onto the refuge was $27 pp so if you have a car, or are staying close, there is no reason to pay for an expensive tour. Tickets are available at the white trailer parked in front of the visitor center. A shuttle will take you to the refuge and bring you back.    Take a blanket with you if it is cool - or you can purchase one from the ticket booth.    It was a short tour and moderately informative ride. Our driver was good spirited and tolerated a very inquisitive group of riders very well. He informed us that his family holds a contract with the federal government to run the excursions, so he grew up doing these tours. They also do rides, camping, and chuck wagon experiences throughout the year (differing locations).    It was nice to get to visit the horses up close after the ride. They are HUGE.    You can drive around the refuge and there are trails around the backside over the butte. I’m sure you can find most of the info on the website 😅 but it’s nice to hear the details from a live person.    We stayed at Rustic Inn, just up the way and didn’t realize until our last few days that we had a direct view to the refuge from a park across the street. 😅"
27,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021 , Couples,"Birmingham, AL ",Absolutely amazing!!!,Such a great experience! Highly recommend! Very knowledgeable and really enjoyed this. My fav thing we did in Jackson Hole
28,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021,not available,"West Springfield, VA ",Interesting and informative!,"Was awesome to see all the elk and to hear about the refuge, as well as the elk and their travels. Beautiful creatures, beautiful scenery."
29,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2021,not available,"Dry Prong, LA ",Wildlife tour,Me and my wife loved the friendliness and knowledge of both the guide and the bus driver! My favor part was taking pictures and being able to get so close!  We also saw a ball eagle and some more wildlife!
30,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021 , Couples,"Kingsville, MD ",Good for families and to be closer to the elk,"Great opportunity to take pictures up close and from a safe spot. Ideal for families with small children. Purchased tickets from the booth at the visitor center, where we were picked up and transported to/from the refuge. Employees are very friendly."
31,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021,not available,"Asheville, NC ",A great little pit stop,"For only an hour-long experience, this packs a punch. Our guide Conner was great and we were thankful for all his knowledge of the refuge, the history, and the elk themselves. It was amazing to see so many elk in one place amidst the amazing backdrop of the Tetons. Buying our tickets and shuttling to the sleigh couldn't have been easier and the ride itself was such a trip. A true Jackson must-do!"
32,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021 , Family,"Banff, Canada ",Wonderful sleigh ride seeing the elk.,Wonderful sleigh ride seeing the elk. Our driver was very knowledgeable and funny. The elk were amazing especially the sounds they make.
33,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021 , Couples,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, ",Nice short tour,"We enjoyed our trip to see the elk out on the reserve. Got our tickets in town, waited in the car for a text to board the bus and get on our sled. Our guide was very energetic and enthusiastic about her job. Would recommend"
34,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021 , Friends, ,Snowmobile trip,"Had a great time, made reservations for 12 noon and they were about 15 minutes late, not bad for snow covered roads. They furnish transportation from the Jackson Hole visitor center to and from the Refuge. Take a blanket and dress for the cold, it's flat with nothing stopping the wind.  Our guide was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. Other than getting cold, we're glad we went. From pick up to drop off about 2 hours."
35,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021,not available, ,Majestic creatures,"Such and amazing day with the family. We literally marveled at these beautiful creatures right in their natural habitat. Great job by our tour guide who was not only educational, but funny along the way. It’s no fast roller coaster ride or amusement, but rather even better where you can just sit and relax, listen to the peace and quiet, and watch hundreds and hundreds of elk live in their own natural environment."
36,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021 , Couples,"Cartersville, GA ",Near experience,"Wagons led by horses take you up close and personal with hundreds of elk. Informative, affordable and fun!"
37,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021 , Couples, ,Elk refuge,Super cool! We got takeout lunch and watched the elk with our binoculars . The sleigh ride was also a really cool experience
38,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021 , Friends,"Valdosta, GA ",Worth the time!!,My brother & I went on the sleigh ride through the refuge today & had a great time! Our bus driver Kyle was very friendly. Drove us right up to the sleigh. Our sleigh guide was Clint. He was very engaging & knowledgeable about the Elk. Clint made sure to answer any of our questions & made sure that we had a good view of the Elk. Highly Recommend!
39,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021,not available,"Daphne, AL ",Sleigh ride,This was really amazing. Be prepared for extreme cold. You’ll be able to get really close to the herd and learn a lot about the history of the refuge.
40,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021,not available,"De Pere, WI ",Highlight of our Jackson stay,"I have had the opportunity to visit the Jackson Hole area numerous times during the spring, summer, and autumn season but this was the first time I visited the area during the winter. The National Elk Refuge was at the top of my list to visit.    This review will consist of two parts: the sleigh ride tour of the elk herds and the refuge road scenic drive.    Tickets for the 90-minute sleigh ride tour can be purchased on-line or at the Jackson Visitor Center on the north outskirts of town. The Visitor Center is actually closed due to COVID but a mobile ticket center is operational. We arrived a little after 9:00 A.M to purchase our tickets. The first tour begins at 10 and we were loaded on the bus around 10:10 for the short ride to the refuge. The sleigh’s capacity is 20 guests but they are limiting the tour to 10 due to COVID. On our tour everyone was in compliance in regards to wearing a mask. Blankets can be purchased for $40.    The sleigh is pulled by two draft horses and can be rather bumpy (and cold). Our guide was Bridger and he did an excellent job of discussing the purpose of the refuge and providing information about the elk herd. The herds are massive. We did not see any huge bulls on our tour and Bridger indicated this was the norm as they prefer to form small bachelor groups rather than join the large herds at the refuge. We had three or four stops for photos along the perimeter of the herd. Well worth the $27 fee for the tour.    An even better bargain is the refuge road scenic drive (Free). This road goes through part of the refuge and while we did not see elk on this road, bighorn sheep were prevalent. To find the road, drive past the Jackson hospital and you will arrive at a large National Elk Refuge sign. I have driven this road in the fall and summer and seen very little but this trip we drove the road twice and were delighted to be in close proximity of a large herd of sheep both days (40 to 50). For me this was the highlight of our Jackson stay."
41,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2021,not available,"Fort Myers, FL ",Must see elk refuge,This refuge is beautiful. Tours are able to get you a close to herds of elk in the wild! Natural living is preserved in a wonderful way!
42,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021 , Couples, ,Nice Peaceful Side Trip,We purchased our tickets online and pick them up at the little mobile trailer at the Chamber of Commerce parking lot. I think this is also the town visitor center. Visitor center is closed due to Covid. From the ticket pick up a bus picked us up and drove us a few miles to the refuge.  At the refuge we hopped on a sleigh pulled by horses. The tour lasts about an hour to an hour and a half. The sleigh is bumpy. I really didn’t expect that. The elk really seem unfazed by the horses in the sleigh. All in all it was a nice side trip
43,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021 , Family,"Hoover, AL, ",Lots of Elk,There were lots of elk in this refuge. We did not do the sleigh tour. Can see a lot from pulling over on the highway.
44,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2020,not available,"Jonesboro, GA ",Winter 2020,"Very cold sleigh ride, but being able to be in the middle of all of the animals was amazing. Also drove to the back side of the refuge and saw the sheep."
45,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021 , Couples,Arizona ,Not covid friendly,"If you are at all concerned about Covid, would NOT recommend this tour, half the people weren’t wearing masks or had them around their chin. As we were boarding our sleigh half of our group was maskless so we asked one of the employees if masks were required, she responded with “we aren’t the mask police”, we asked to wait for another sleigh and were told that there may not be space at all in the day. The manager then came out and asked everyone on our sleigh if they could put on masks, which most put on just on their chin and took off later. The tour guide also never mentioned anything.    Wildlife tour is great but would hold off until after the pandemic"
46,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021,not available,"Boston, MA ",Last minute excursion before we left Jackson Hole,A must do for up close and personal experience in the refuge! Very informative and beautiful to experience!
47,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021 , Couples,"Dingmans Ferry, PA ",Sleigh Ride Through The Refuge,My wife and I took the sleigh ride in the refuge. It was interesting to see and hear about the refuge on the ride.During our ride we also saw a Bald Eagle and a group of coyotes hunting in the refuge. We also heard them howling in the distance. This is the only way to see the elk up close. Drive back into town to take the refuge car drive to see a heard of Bighorn Sheep on the other side of the refuge!
48,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Informative & Unique Experience,"We really enjoyed our experience. We went around 2:30 in the afternoon, which paid off because that's apparently around the time the elk start moving around again during the day. Our guide Dallee was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. It was really neat to see the animals up close and learn more about their lives and the influence the refuge has on them. We would recommend this activity for those traveling to Jackson."
49,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021 , Couples, ,Best value guided trip in jackson,"An amazing experience, we lucked out and had bridger as a guide, he was incredibly knowledgeable and charasmatic. Definitely made the experience. We saw so many elk! And for 27 dollars is easily one of the cheapest things to do in jackson but man is it worth it. Will definitely be returning sometime in the season. Also if you read the one star reviews you may have realized that if you come here outside of the elk migration, you won't see any elk. A very hard concept for some people apparently. So please do the bare minimum of research in order to assure you have as wonderful a time as I did."
50,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021,not available,"Dawsonville, GA ",Definitely worth the trip,"Although we had book a Wednesday morning tour on our way from the airport on Monday we saw large numbers of Elk already on the refuge so we immediately stopped and purchased our tickets. After a short five minute van ride we boarded a wagon with a wonderful guide that took us right into the center of the heard. We saw everything from massive bulls to small cows. In addition our guide provided a very informative talk about the refuge , its history, mission and operation. It was definitely worth the price. Just be sure to dress warmly and don`t be surprised by a bumpy ride."
51,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021,not available, ,A very interesting 1 hour tour with lots of information and picture taking opportunities,We went on the first sled of the morning 10 AM It was snowing which made the horse drawn sled even more interesting. Our sled driver & tour guide was very knowledgeable. We stopped several times to take a closer look and pictures of the elk.
52,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021 , Friends, ,Highly Recommend!,So much fun! The elk were beautiful and the horses were so much fun to meet afterwards! Buy the blanket ahead of time....it’s cold out there!
53,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2021,not available,"Tacoma, WA ",We had private sleigh - Worth it!,"It was only 11 degrees when we visited the Elk Refuge, but we didn't mind. The views of the Elk, mountains and surrounding area is spectacular. We were fortunate to have a sunny day and could see all of the Tetons and Sleeping Indian. We paid $500 for the private sleigh and were glad we did. Very peaceful and didn't have to worry about germs from any one else. Also purchased one of the blankets at the ticket trailer and was glad we did. Very nice blanket, washable and warm during our sleigh ride!"
54,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2020,not available,"Gainesville, GA ",Sleigh > Car,"We called the morning we visited and hoped to get tickets to ride the sleigh, but they were sold out and said they'd call us if they had any no-shows, but we never got a call. It was a busy holiday time so this wasn't completely unexpected, but a little disappointing. It did seem unusual that they said we could have a private tour if we wanted to spend $500 - so it seems that they actually had the ability to take another sleigh out, but were choosing not to do so. That made it more disappointed.    So, we drove the road in our car to see the elk, but they were VERY VERY VERY far away. We did get to see a bunch of big horned sheep and a golden eagle while we were on the refuge road so that was super cool. But the elk were just too far to get a good look. And the road is closed in winter so you can't go very far.    So....if you want to go, make a reservation for the sleigh ride early!"
55,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2020,not available, ,Amazing Experience!,The guide was very knowledgeable and we learned an in-depth amount of information on the Elk Refuge. The sleigh ride was a great way to get up close to the Elk and we were able to take some really wonderful photos.
56,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2020,not available, ,as expected,It can get very popular so make a reservation in advance. Dress appropriately. It's a nice little ride into the refuge. You don't get super close to the Elk and thats understandable. I recommend binoculars. Guide offers an abundance of information.
57,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2020,not available,"Poughkeepsie, NY ",Fun and Informative Visit to the National Elk Refuge,"Visiting the National Elk Refuge is safe and easy despite Covid. Tickets are available for purchase on-line or at the Jackson Hole Visitors Center. A school or shuttle bus drives the ~2 miles to where the horse-drawn sleighs are. And then the sleigh ride itself is about 1 hour with about 10 people. Although outside, masks are required as it is not possible to space 6 feet in the sled. Also, blankets are not provided due to Covid so bring your own if needed. The time in the sleigh was both informative as well as impressive being close to so many elk. After the ride, you can get pictures of the horses and then hop back on the bus to the Visitors Center. This is a great experience for people of all ages."
58,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2020 , Couples,"Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States ",Loved it.,Definitely something to do. Very informative and stunning scenery. Got to see so many elk. Our guide was awesome and knowledgeable.
59,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2020,not available,"Jacksonville, Florida ","Elk, Elk and More Elk","Wonderful to see so many elk - we were too early for the tours (Nov.) but the ELK had started coning down and by the end of the week there must have been over 2,000.  Lots of pull-outs on the highway TO STOP AND VIEW. If you take the back road you will be over the ridge and that is where the big horn sheep reside.SO FORTUNATE TO SEE so many CLOSE UP - A BUCKET LIST EXPERIENCE."
60,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2020,not available, ,Great place to see Elk,"We were able to see Elk, just walking around and Longhorn Sheep. We took a tour and the guide was fabulous. But you can just drive through in car; or on a run. The Elk also are just walking around outside of the refuge as well."
61,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2020,not available,"Moraga, CA ",saw an Elk,This was the first thing I did the first morning and I was blessed to see an elk who must have just woken up. He appeared out of nowhere and crossed the road right in front of me. He let me look at him for quite a while. Made my day!
62,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2019 , Couples, ,Highly recommended,"My boyfriend and I went March 2019. I was just irritated that someone claimed the cover photo is fake. I’ve seen it with my own eyes, it’s not fake, and I attached photos I took myself. I’m sure the time of year you go has a lot to do with it. We had a great trip. The sun was out so it was actually quite warm. They provided blankets in the sled just in case (pre-COVID). Not sure what they do now. The elk were used to the sleigh and didn’t run away. We did have someone in the sled that felt the need to start making noises with their mouth and that caused a few elk to get up, and wonder away. Don’t be that person. I would definitely do this activity again. The guide was very friendly, knowledgeable and people did give him cash tips."
63,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2020,not available, ,Wildlife Hot Spot,Well located and very accessible spot to see wildlife. This entire area is on beautiful sight after another.

67,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2020 , Family,"Indianapolis, IN ",Fun distraction,This is a fun distraction while driving to the Tetons National Park. One morning we were surprised buy the running elk. It was really exciting watching them run fairly close to the traffic. Lots of people capturing photos
68,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2020,not available,"Alpharetta, GA, ",No Elk in September,You can’t miss it on your way in or out of town.    No Elk in September. We were told jokingly by several people that the Elk arrive just two or three days before the start of hunting season.

71,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2020,not available,"York, ME, ",A beautiful sight to behold,Great to see the National Elk Refuge. We didn't hit the right time to see the elk but it does give us plenty of reason to return in the winter. Just a few minutes drive from Jackson town square.

74,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2019,not available,"Montville, NJ, ",Get up early to see animals,"The National Elk Refuge in Jackson Hole Wyoming was established by an Act of Congress in 1912 It is one of 568 National Refuges. Prior to 1912 elk migrated through this area for centuries. One end of the refuge is located near the Jackson Visitor Center. It is here in the winter that tickets can be bought for their sleigh ride to see the elk. From the visitor center and van takes you to where the sleighs are located. The sleighs take you into the refuge to where the elk are located. You can not get out of the sleigh and binoculars are a real asset. Blankets are available for use. With wind and temperatures in the 20's or lower, blankets are useful. The mini -vans run every 20 minutes during the season.    As a National Refuge, hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing, wildlife photography, education and interpretation are acceptable uses of the refuge. There is an observation deck at the visitor center.    The refuge is 6 miles wide and 10 miles long. Predominate trees are aspen, blue spruce, willow and Douglas fir. The topography of the land consists mostly of marsh ta and meadows with some rocky outcrops. The elevation ranges from 6,300-7,200. There are roads that will take you into the refuge. Dawn and dusk are key times if you want to see wildlife. Most other times in the day you are likely to see nothing. Elk, pronghorn sheep, mule deer, moose, coyote, wolves, bear and a large assortment of birds can be seen at times."
75,National_Elk_Refuge,Jul 2020 , Family,Missouri ,Short drive just outside of town,"This is a beautiful place just outside of Jackson. There’s an abundance of roads to explore that offer unique vantage points, beautiful scenery, and the opportunity to see lots of animals."

Blankets are provided....temps were in the low 20s F and skies a little overcast but we wore ski jackets and were comfortable.

87,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2020 , Family,"Frankfort, NY ",Amazing experience,"We stopped at the visitor center in Jackson, which, by the way, is a great center with gifts & educational displays, and discovered the sleigh rides through the center. You purchase tickets for sleigh ride at the center and a van/bus brings you up the road to the place where the sleighs are ready to load. No private vehicles are allowed at the place where the sleighs are. The ride out to the elk can be a little bumpy and cold but they do provide very warm blankets to cover up with. Our guide was very informative about the elk & preserve. You get close enough to the elk for great photo opportunities without scaring them. The view of the Grand Tetons in the background is just stunning. I highly recommend this amazing opportunity to see the elk. You do not feed them or get out of the sleigh for safety reasons. We saw a beautiful bald eagle, a coyote and thousands of elk on this adventure."

107,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2020,not available,"Seattle, WA ",My reason for visiting Jackson,I live in NW Wyoming but had never been to the Elk Refuge. Was given a 2 day trip for Christmas and the only thing on my bucket list to start was the Elk Refuge. It did not disappoint. We were bundled up under wool blankets in an open sleigh pulled by 2 beautiful draft horses through the grounds among the elk. We had an excellent guide who was a fountain of history and facts I had never heard. The history of the refuge was amazing and the animals were beautiful. I love to photograph Wyoming wildlife as a hobby and today was a great gift. I recommend it to anyone visiting Jackson! In addition to the 5000 elk who reside here I also saw a coyote hunting for dinner and several deer and bald eagles. Bring warm clothes during the winter months!! Enjoy one of our beautiful natural resources along with the amazing mountains and peaks surrounding Jackson. There is parking at the Refuge Visitor Center and free shuttle buses to the destination.

Beautiful scenery and the elk were magnificent to see so close. A nice activity to squeeze into the afternoon when we didn’t have a lot of extra time.

Once there you get into open air, horse drawn wagons. The guides give information about the refuge and the elk as you go along. It was very cool!"
114,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2020,not available,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Wonderful!,"Just amazing..seeing these beautiful creatures up close and in their habitat. We had the best guide who was both knowledgeable and funny. Other than my family of 5, there were 2 other people which gave us ample opportunity to ask questions. The guide was so respectful as to not disturb the elk in any way. We drove out in the sleigh and stopped in the middle of the herd which were very active - we even saw two elk jostling each other's antlers. It was very windy on the plain and I highly suggest wearing a warm hat and even ski/snowboard pants. A warm blanket is provided, but even on a 30 degree day we would have been cold with the wind blowing if not properly dressed. If you have time, check out the visitor center. Lots to see and learn! Well worth the time and money! Be sure to tip your guide !"
115,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2019 , Family, ,Great trip,"The Elk Refuge sleigh tour and our guide/driver was excellent. Our guide explained about Elk survival and habit and showed us through the reserve which was beautiful.

We drove past the site several times as we explored the area but it was too early for most elk to have come. We saw only a couple. We heard the Visitor Center was excellent, but we opted to skip it and stop at the one in Grand Teton instead. Once the snow falls it must be a great place to visit."

We were surprised to see that they are not scared by people or cars. Its like they know they are safe! They were relaxed and walked and grazed as though we weren’t there. We never tried to approach them, but they were very close to the road, sometimes 20 feet away. It’s so nice to see how Jackson Hole is preserving habitat for the native species. I wish all communities would take a page from their book!"

We did see antelope, elk (from a distance), moose and bison—but they were few and far between. I recommend going with a guide or a guidebook or you’ll miss a lot of dimension to the experience."

We managed to get a beautiful day though for this tour. The horses were beautiful and huge. The sled had very heavy wool blankets for everyone, but one needed to be wearing a down coat, good gloves, a ski hat, and muffler to stay warm. The wind is pretty relentless once one gets out onto the refuge land. The guide gave a great commentary and stopped several times so we could get pictures. This was the best $50 we spent while in Jackson Hole, for sure."

I think in a week's time I didn't see a single one driving by here almost everyday. So I got some information as a summer visitor about the Elk Refuge.  The fence is a one sided fence that was installed to keep Elk from migrating through their natural point of migration, the town of Jackson. In the winter time, Elk head south through Jackson to find warmer weather, food, etc... So the fence was installed to keep them from coming through the town, and the refuge also provides them with additional food in the winter time.  Not much to see at all in the Summer, but lots of Elk come winter time."

There were a few walkers on the trial as well. There is parking all along the path so you can stop and go fairly easily from the road.
167,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Family,"Philadelphia, PA ",We came for the big horn sheep,Our b&b hostess told us we would find big horn sheep just beyond (behind?) the Elk Refuge. It was snowing pretty hard (end of May!?) but we drove out to the end of the road and made a left at the refuge. Drive about a mile up the road and look in the rocky hills to your left--tons of sheep! It was awesome and not to be missed. No charge.
168,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Family,"Papillion, Nebraska, United States ",Looking for Elk!,It was fun driving through the refuge! Only got to see mountain sheep and an American Bald Eagle! Would have liked to seen more!
169,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"LaBelle, FL ",Wonderful time!!,"Listen, my husband and I were on our honeymoon and we both agreed that we could not go just once. We ended up in the refuge 3 times on our honeymoon. I made the call to rent a camera lens for one of the trips and it was worth it. The information we got on each ride was different, always focused on the reason the refuge was built, how they maintain it, how the elk manage, general elk behavior, and how the horses manage the work. The elk come close and watching them interact among themselves is a sight."
170,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Couples, ,Sightseeing,Beautiful place to view the elk. Scenery is amazing. Would love to have spent more time in area!!!!!
171,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Solo,"Raleigh, NC ",No elk but saw big horn sheep,"Visited in May 2019 and went on a TSS wildlife expedition. We went into the elk refuge and saw big horn sheep. At this point the elk had migrated north but still a rewarding experience. Jackson offers so many opportunities to view wildlife so keep looking,"
172,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Couples,Texas ,Beautiful drive thru refuge,"Got to see a herd of rams, elk, hawks and other wildlife during drive thru of refuge -- recommend a slow drive to take it all in."
173,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Friends,"Brisbane, Australia ",Winter destination,So the elk really only come in during winter when they are fed. Sleigh rides run by the bar t 5 group are a fun option then. In summer Boy Scouts collect shed antler to seep at JACKSON to obtain money to feed Elks in winter.    In summer it’s a plain land and you may see bison etc but mainly morning and dusk.    So do your research as to when you are visiting but it’s a great initiative to save elk numbers
174,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Friends, ,National Elk Refuge - great place to see bighorn sheep,We enjoyed watching the bighorn sheep which was right by the road and even on the road at times. Lots of good photos.
175,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Family, ,Saw lots of eildlude,"It is worth driving thru the refuge if you want to see wildlife. We spotted Elk,, Bison, Big Horned Sheep and Pronghorned Antlope and sheep. Some we even got up close pictures of."
176,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Friends,"Vancouver, WA ",Not too exciting in May,"We visited the Refuge in May. We got up close and personal with the sheep (while trying to keep them from licking the car). There was a gorgeous long horned sheep sitting on the side of the road. He looked like a statue. As someone else mentioned, the elk herd starts migrating in the spring. We find the remaining herd but it was a bit too far off to get a good look or a good photo."
177,National_Elk_Refuge,Apr 2019 , Couples,"Chessington, UK, ",Interesting,"There were still a lot of elk at the reserve, although they had started to migrate away by the beginning of April. The sleigh rides had stopped, so they could only be seen from a distance."
178,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Couples,"Dallas, TX ",Pick your time to visit,"We visited the area in May to discover that most of the Elk had left for the hills. Apparently they migrate upwards in the spring and return in the fall. So, pick your season.  Even in the spring we did manage to see some wildlife by driving up the valley (north) especially just before sunset. Not easy to spot so take your time, and please take advantage of the many turnouts and don’t stop in the roadway."
179,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2019 , Solo, ,Enjoyed seeing them at a distance,It’s nice to see such large herds of the elk and other wildlife have such a large peaceful area to live.
180,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Couples,"Palm Bay, United States ",Sleigh Ride through National Elk Refuge,"What a great trip! Everyone should do this at least once. Tickets are purchased and picked up at the Jackson Hole Visitor's Center. Then you are taken by bus to the preserve where you board a sleigh and are pulled by two beautiful horses. Along the way you will see beautiful scenery, eagles, horns that have been shed, and a huge heard of beautiful majestic elk. Our guild was very knowledgeable and attentive. Definitely a must do experience."

The sleigh driver was very knowledgeable, friendly, and interesting. We were able to ride through the herd wihtout disturbing them. Got excellent pictures. Very enjoyable trip and very reasonable price. During the winter, definitely dress warmly."
186,National_Elk_Refuge,Apr 2019 , Family,"Kimberly, ID ",Too Late,We missed the busy season with the elk so they were kinda sparse this time. I've seen them before when they are there by the thousands and it is so worth the time to see them.
187,National_Elk_Refuge,Apr 2019 , Couples,"St. Marys, GA ",Lots of fun,"The welcome center for the Elk Refuge had lots of interesting information about the local wildlife. They also had an outdoor viewing station, gift shop and information desk. We purchased tickets from them for a sleigh ride that took us onto the elk refuge to see the herds of elk. They brought us within 30 feet of the herd. We were able to take photos and the tour guide was chok filled of interesting information. Highly recommend if you are in the area during the winter months."
188,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Cheyenne, WY ",Sleigh ride,This is a great way to see the elk up close. We purchased tickets at the Jackson Hole Greater Yellowstone visitors center ($25 per adult) then a shuttle took us to the location where we got on the sleigh (a big wagon) and enjoyed the 1hr up close view of the elk.
189,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Lakeville, MN ","Wow, that's a lot of Elk!!!","Fun, but rough ride, out to where the heard of Elk were gathered.

Highly recommended"
191,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Solo,"Los Angeles, CA ",Elk Sparring,"Very informative horse drawn guided wagon(Sleigh)ride into the Elk Preserve led by Jordan.

193,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Friends,"Steamboat Springs, CO ",Great Experience! Guide:Taylor needs a little support!,"This is a wonderful and unique experience and over the winters(years) we have come again and again. We have had Rich, Matty, Clint ( the list goes on)....numerous guides that have helped us to have a great experience! I highly recommend it! So fun to ride in the sleigh, learn about the elk and having the privilege to get so close!    We went multiple days in a row on our most recent trip in March 2019 and most of the trips were wonderful. I would request you ride a few times with Taylor and give her some pointers. We had elk moving away from her sled because she was too loud and it would have been nice to take a few 5-10 breaks and enjoy the noises of the elk and be immersed. She never stopped talking, even when we politely tried to hint to her by asking pointed questions about their noises, then again when she asked us to listen to the noises of their sparring, we were unable to do so. Also her facts did not reflect what we had learned on other rides. I am sure it takes a lot of hard work to be the star of attention to a whole sleigh and we look forward to coming back.    Still 5 stars and we can't wait to come back.... thank you to the Team and US Fish & Wildlife!"
194,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family, ,Awesome!,"Really glad that we decided to do this. Price is reasonable and it was very educational. You don't need reservations. We signed up that day and got on one of the sleds within the half hour. FYI, it is a bumpy ride out to the elk on the sled. They provide heavy blankets but dress warm on a cold day because you are out there for an hour. Very cool to see so many elk up close."
195,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Westfield, New Jersey ",Well Worth It,"The thought of a sleigh ride seemed a bit too touristy to our family at first, but we took the tour when we had time to kill since our skis didn't arrive with our flights. It was well worth it. The information visitor center is nicely set up and the staff are friendly. The driver/guide offered a great deal of knowledge of the herd and history of the refuge and surrounding area. The Elk were plentiful and active, and a small pack of coyotes were present.    Highly recommended."
196,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Little Rock, AR ",Sleigh ride through elk refuge,"Great, informative sleigh ride through the elk refuge. Inexpensive, and a great way to get up close to hundreds of elk. Good photo opportunities. I would definitely recommend as a thing to do in Jackson Hole. Quick shuttle ride, 2 miles from visitors center. Then an hour ride seeing the elk and learning about refuge."
197,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Newport News, VA ",A Pasture with Thousands of Elk,My son and I took a horse drawn sleigh ride into the National Elk Refuge. Amazing to see thousands of wild elk just feet away from your sleigh. We took about a hundred photos and shared them with our friends. Very affordable and a must do while in Jackson
198,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Friends,"Griffin, GA ",Don’t miss this!,"By far our favorite part of visiting Jackson Hole! Take in all the information inside the visitors center and you’ll see live animals and learn their stories... we saw 2 falcons and an owl! The wagon on sleds took us literally into the middle of part of the herd of elk. Mike, Our driver, was an expert and gave a delightful and informative monologue. He was also more than willing to answer our many questions! Definitely well worth the time and expense!!!"
199,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Ogden, UT ",Very interesting,You can only visit in the winter when the elk are here. They take You from the visitor center in a bus a few miles down the road. The wagon takes 18 people out among the elk. There were about 600 elk the day we went. They feed them once a day to avoid starvation in the winter. The cost is $25 for adults and $15.00 for kids over 4. It takes about an hour and a half. It is very informative.
200,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Colorado Springs, Colorado ",Amazing Way To Get Up Close & Personal With Sprawling Herds of Elk,"Always our FAVORITE excursion in Jackson Hole!!! The staff of the Double H Bar, Inc are incredible, informative and very friendly. Sleighs are large with heavy blankets for warmth and are guided by gorgeous draft horses. Tons of photo opportunities and enjoyable time for the entire family to view sprawling herds of elk, up close and personal. There seems to be larger herds in end February / first part of March though timing is everything as by 3rd week of March, the big bulls are starting to shed their antlers. Reservations can be made by phone, online or at the Visitor Center."
201,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Couples,"Lake Worth, FL ",Relaxing and informative,This is a great way to see nature and enjoy its beauty. The guides know a lot about the wildlife around and we found it very interesting. We had brought our kids here several years ago and they loved it as well. It is a great way to spend time with family.
202,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family,"Sallisaw, OK ",Wonderful Sites,"Do not get me wrong...if you are not in to nature it is not an exciting trip but if you love to see wildlife and scenery you have many options. Buffalo, elk, moose..."
203,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2018,not available, ,Check it Out,A great way to see lots of elk. In the winter & spring you might get lucky enough to see wolves. Take a wagon ride 8f you can.
204,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Solo,south carolina ,great fun,Their web site needs some work. I went today March 14 and their web site said nothing was available till tomorrow. It also shows departures every hour on the hour. Basically all you do is go to the visitor center which I did and get a ticket and they put you on the next available ride. I only had to wait about 15 minutes till I was on a shuttle bus taking me two miles away to get on a sleigh. Our guide was outstanding and it was awesome to be right next to the herd. They are well organized and efficient and price is reasonable. Don't miss it.
205,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Colleyville, TX ",Beautiful Animals....$25 for the 1 hour sleigh ride....Well worth it.,"We thoroughly enjoyed this sleigh ride within the Elk Refuge. We were picked up in a van from the visitor center and transported to the Refuge. We then boarded an open air sleigh pulled by beautiful horses. It was a snowy morning however we dressed warm and they provided blankets so all was good. Our guide, Matty, was very friendly and intelligent. She would stop periodically so we could take pictures and just gaze at the beautiful elk. After the tour we were transported back to the Visitor Center."
206,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Ottawa, IL ",Elk up close and personal!,"If you like elk, this is not to be missed! We took the $25 hour long sleigh ride out to the herd, and the guide was very informative and being that close to thousands of elk was fabulous!"
207,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Family,"Earls Colne, UK ","Excellent trip, definitely worth doing","We took a day off skiing and decided to visit the Elk reserve. What a great decision! You can reserve your tickets but we just turned up. You sit in a horse drawn cart, with some nice warm blankets. Then you are taken through the herd. We saw Elk, foxes, bald eagles. Our guide was informative and interesting and I can definitely recommend the trip. The refuge centre is also a good place to buy t-shirts and gifts, not only do you benefit the refuge but the prices are cheaper than the town."
208,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Couples,"Kenosha, WI ",A fun way to see the elk up close!,"This is a fun way to see elk -- lots and lots of elk -- up close and personal, in a very safe manner. Tickets are $25 a person, but the sleigh only holds 12 or so passengers, so it's a small group. Bundle up, because this is, after all, outside, in the winter, in Jackson Hole, where it can be snowing, blowing, and downright cold!    Or, as on our day, a gloriously sunny day, as luck would have it.    You must get a reservation for this trip, which lasts about an hour or so. And you show up at the Jackson Visitor Center to pay and get your ticket. A small shuttle bus takes you a couple miles up the road to the Elk Refuge, where you disembark, meet your sleigh driver, and get going rather quickly. They do hand out a liberal amount of blankets, to help keep you warm, but do dress accordingly -- in layers, and wisely.    Our driver was very interesting, conveying lots of facts about the horses (we had Percheron draft horses; the other horses they use are Belgian draft horses), about the elk refuge, about the elk, about feeding in the winter, and on and on. He stresses safety, so, while the sleigh is moving, keep your seats, please. He does stop frequently, both so he can continue his stories, and so you can take pictures.    The scenery is beautiful, the elk are magnificent creatures, the sleigh ride is fun, and it gives you a chance to cuddle up to your sweetie. What more could you want?"
209,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Orange, VA ",Thrilling to watch wolves,"This is always a highlight to visiting Jackson Hole! We ride in the back road and usually see Elk and mountain goats up close. This year we got to watch 6 wolves as they fed and played in the snow. What a treat! I know all the arguments about the wolves, but to see these in the wild is something else for an East coaster!"
210,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Friends, ,Super winter sleigh ride,The trip out to see the elk herd up close was fun and informative.  This was the last thing we did after driving around the Teton national forest. Great end to a fun day.

212,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,"Kennett Square, PA ",A must-do when in Jackson in the winter,"We really enjoyed the National Elk Refuge tour. It only takes a couple hours total. They take you out to a herd of elk in a horse-drawn sleigh. You get to within about 30 yards of the elk. You hear a lot of interesting information about the elk. It's a beautiful setting with the Tetons in the background. It's possible you will see other wildlife as well, such as coyotes, goats and swans. If you are with kids, they will enjoy it as well. Our 4- and 9-year-old sons loved it."
213,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Family,quebec ,not to be missed when in Jackson Hole,It was wonderful to see the elks . the guide was excellent in giving explanations and answering questions. You are taken in a horse drawn carriage. dress warmly we were in our ski clothes and it was windy ! We were lucky we saw young males play fighting. We also saw in front of the museum of National wildlife 2 deers and on a off road in the mountains a moose and her calf so we could appreciate all 3 species.
214,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",Make the effort to get here,"Whether you take the sleigh tour or drive in on your own, it's worth getting here. In fact, do both. You'll get very different experiences. On the day we did the sleigh tour we got a special show of two bucks fighting. There were plenty of elk to see up close and our guide was fun and informative. A few days later, we drove in on our own to the other side of the preserve (free of charge). We got to see different animals and took a ton of photos. And for those few that complained they saw no animals, well this is nature, not a zoo. The majority of the time, the animals are cooperating with us humans and are ready for their close ups."
215,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Couples,"Flower Mound, TX ",Definitely Worth It,The tour wasn't long (about an hour) but our guide was knowledgeable and gave an enjoyable overview. We got up close to the Elk and had some great pictures including what appeared to be a friendly sparing between two bulls.

217,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Business,"Jackson, WY, ",Wonderful!,"A bit bumpy, but a one of a kind experience for many! The hour long ride takes you within feet of thousands of wild elk safely and informatively. Your driver tells you all you’d like to know about wapiti though it may be challenging to hear him due to the noise of the ride. Blankets are provided but please dress for cold and exposure. Thus is a Real Treat!  Buy tickets at the multiagency Jackson Hole Greater Yellowstone Visitor Center on the north edge of Jackson."

221,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2019 , Couples,"Concord, MA ",Best $25 experience ever,This was a terrific experience and a bargain compared to other tours. If you are visiting town make sure to do this.

222,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Family, ,Wonderful Sleigh Ride,We had such a great time on this activity. Our whole group loved seeing the elk up close and we learned a lot from our guide. Dress warmly — they provide blankets but it's cold out there! We had a lot of fun. It was well organised.

After getting your tickets, you take a free shuttle bus, which leaves every 30 minutes or so, to the sleigh boarding area three miles north of Jackson. Sleigh rides last approximately one hour, including the shuttle ride to and from the sleigh ride site. This season there were 4500 elk on the refuge. We loved the opportunity to see the elk so closely…they were completely unfazed by our sleigh!"
224,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Louisville, KY ",Nature at its finest,"There's not too much to say... A horse drawn sleigh across the refuge to a herd of elk 5400 strong. The herd allows the sleigh within several feet without startle. One recommendation, have the group spend a minute or two in silence and just listen to nature. Elk are quite silent on their own anyway. Just imagine being in the midst of a heard of thousands of elk and listening to nature. It's very inspiring and humbling!"
225,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family,"Mooresville, NC ",Neat to see,We went on this since my cousin recommended it. It was nice but I was a little disappointed that we only got to see the bull elk. The refuge was limiting the number of sleighs that went out to the females and their babies. It would have been nice if we were told this ahead of time. Overall it was nice and our guide was able to give us a lot of information about the elk.
226,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Solo,"Sioux City, IA ",A wonderful setting and there is more to see than Elk.,"The refuge is set in a beautiful location with Mountains in the background and water running through. Located across from the National Wildlife Museum you get a natural two attractions in one here. With each season you can see something different here but the Elk herd is the iconic attraction. Great family entertainment and even though I did not take the sleigh ride out, it looked as though people were enjoying it. From the Museum they have a spotting scope that is very good. Well worth the stop."
227,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Family,"McDonough, GA ",Wonderful White Out!,We took the sleigh ride out to see the elk. It was quite a unique experience especially when a quick snow storm blew in! We laughed so hard! It wouldn't have been so funny but the contrast to the slow bumpy ride and the incredible views of elk to the can't see five feet in front of your face was very entertaining! It was a good thing that the horses knew how to get us back across the bridge! We loved all of it!
228,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Family,"Panama City, FL ",Sleigh Ride!,"We enjoyed a sleigh ride through the National Elk Refuge with our children as a part of a wildlife tour with Buck Brush Tours. We were fortunate with a perfect day with little wind and moderate temperatures, but be sure and check the weather before your ride and dress appropriately. We saw a few coyotes and more elk than you can imagine. Would do it again."
229,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Amazing Day for a Sleigh Ride,"This was a fantastic day at the Elk Refuge. I remembered doing this as a child numerous times but never in my adult life. It was just as I remembered, a very serene and picturesque setting. Turns out it was the most beautiful day they’ve had all season but even at 20 degrees it was almost warm with the sun shining so bright. We had an excellent guide, Rich. He was knowledgeable, funny and willing to stop whenever we wanted for photo ops. It’s absolutely amazing to get up close and personal with these beautiful animals. It’s great to hear the history and to support an organization that supports nature like this. Great experience for kids and anyone really."
230,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples, ,Big Bucks!,"We took the sleigh ride out in February. IT was windy and snowing and cold! We loved it! The elk herd was large and we go up pretty close. The young males were ""jousting"" a bit, pretty cool. On the way back a bald eagle flew right over our sleigh! Very majestic! Probably 30 ft away from us."
231,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Albany, NY ",Very neat experience! Make sure you dress warm and it is a bit too long in my opinion.,"We were informed of the elk tour during our stay in Jackson and though it sounded interesting. Since we did not have a car we had to walk to the building from town, it is a bit of a walk and the signage to the facility could have been a bit better, we stopped at the National Park building erroneously. Once there the staff were friendly and helpful in getting us the information for the tour we were to be taking. They have displays and items to purchase at the facility while you wait. They bring you to the location in a bus which is only a few minute ride away. Once there you are loaded onto a sleigh that is pulled by two draft horse (very regal and beautiful animals). They provide you with wool blankets which you definitely need! Make sure you dress warm as you ride into a large open field that can be windy. The ride in the sleigh is rough and bounces you around, so be prepared for that as well. The driver provides you with interesting facts about the elk and the reserve and will answer an questions. Our driver made numerous stops so we could take pictures and take in the views. The tour lasted about an hour, which I found to be a bit too long for me, but that is subject to the individual. In addition to the elk we saw bald eagles as well, which was cool. The drivers expect tips, so be prepared for that.  Overall, it was a neat an unique experience."

234,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Pine, CO ",Elk by the thousand!,"We decided to take the sleigh ride in the Elk Refuge and are very glad we did. Not only did we get an up close and personal view of the thousands of elk on the refuge but the sleigh driver was knowledgeable and entertaining. Not only did we see the Elk but also Coyotes, Bald and Golden Eagles. Well worth an hour of your time."
235,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Cartersville, GA ",Great family experience,You are spending $25 a person for about an hour worth of activity. With that said I think it is worth it. This was probably a once in a life time trip so we did a lot of the things we wanted. This was one of them. The guide encouraged all of us to ask questions and we learned so much about the town and elks. It was amazing how they wouldn’t run off or really seem to be bothered by us.    A reminder it is really cold there. When we went on the ride I believe it was still below zero. They have blankets on the sleigh but even with those it was very cold so come prepared and bundled up! Also remember that the poor guides are out in that weather all day. I know our guide had just finished a ride and had another as soon as we finished. There was a sign mentioning a tip and we did give one. This is just something to think about since we did not know about this ahead of time. Great experience and absolutely loved it!!
236,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Friends, ,Elk refuge tour,"Really cool experience. Lynne was our tour guide. They take you out on horse drawn sleds to the elk. The elk come down to this valley floor from the mountains in the winter.  Lynne was very knowledgeable and seemed to really care about the elk. Enjoyed his stories, especially the one about a particularly massive elk whose antlers were magnificent. Highly recommend."
237,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Friends,"Highland Park, NJ ",amazing place,"really fascinating to see the herds of Elk. Counted one group, and there were 50. But then saw another group with way too many to count!"
238,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples, ,A must visit but dress warm!,We really enjoyed the sleigh ride at the National Elk Refuge. Kids would really enjoy it too but dress warm!
239,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Rohnert Park, CA ",Great way to get close to the wintering Elk herd,"Very inexpensive, only $25/person. Bring camera and binoculars. Dress warmly, you are in the back of a large horse drawn sleigh for about 1 hr. They have blankets to put on your lap but it can get cold and breezy on the range. The elk are used to the horses/sleighs so dont mind them coming into the herd. We mostly stayed near the bulls as many of the cows had young fawns who are not always easy around horses yet. Basically you park near the herd and they move around your stationery position. The driver will move to another position based on the herd. The driver has tons of information and knowledge to share about the history of the herd, migration, health, development, socialization etc... great for all ages."
240,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Los Angeles, CA ",Possibly the best elk viewing in the world,"The National Elk Refuge is a great place to view the majestic elk. It's a great was to enjoy nature in the winter, when it's harder to access the national parks. If you can, take the sleigh ride that goes into the park."
241,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019,not available,Pennsylvania ,Dress warm and bring a camera,"Riding into the National Elk Reserve on a rustic red wooden horse drawn sleigh is both fun and educational. BE SURE TO DRESS WARM! It is very cold on a typical winter day in Jackson Hole. The unheated sleighs have heavy woolen blankets on board but a blanket is inadequate for this $25.00 one hour tour. TAKE A CAMERA! You may not exit the sleigh during the tour but there will be many close up photo-op stops. In addition to seeing hundreds of elk, you a might also see a moose, bald eagle, or other wild animal."
242,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Solo,"Sunshine Coast, Australia ",Wonderful place,"I visited the Elk Refuge yesterday and took their horse drawn sleigh ride tour, it was extremely informative and seeing the Elk up close was wonderful. A great conservation idea. We also spotted an Ermine and Swans while there. Well worth the trip."
243,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Las Vegas, NV ",Elk up close and personal,"As part of a Yellowstone in winter tour, we had an honest-to-goodness sleigh ride pulled by two large horses. This set up allows really close but safe photo ops. The elk aren’t skittish of the horses and big sleigh. You are so close you can see their mouths chewing and their beautiful eyes. What a way to observe God’s creatures doing what they do. Majestic for sure."
244,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Oklahoma City, OK ",Fun but long for the cold,Great adventure! Can see the elk & take pics very close. Sleigh ride is neat! They provide blankets. We saw a bald eagle as well! There was lots of stalling time - could have accomplished the same with less down time. Overall fun & inexpensive trip. Great for kids! Friendly staff.
245,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Fox Island, United States ",Worth the Experience,"The Elk Refuge was fun and informative. If you have never seen an Elk herd up close, it is worth the 1 hour draft-horse drawn ride to experience wild Elk in their habitat."
246,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Gadsden, AL ",DON'T MISS THIS EXPERIENCE,"This is a horse drawn, sleigh ride into the Elk Refuge for an up close viewing of the elk herds. It only costs $25 per adult and takes an hour to do. The guides are VERY knowledgable about the animals you encounter, the history of the Refuge and all aspects of the experience. The best value of money and time that you could invest."
247,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Berwyn, PA ","Elk—Posing for Pictures,",Took a horse drawn sleigh ride through the refuge. Surprised to hear the history and see so many animals in such a setting. ( The males are usually separate from the females. )  Rode to within 10 yards of many elk who seemed to pay no attention to the horse drawn sleigh.
248,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Sunny Isles Beach, FL ",A chilly and up close sleigh ride,"To start, it was great if you've ever wanted to see an elk up close and personal. It was great. My gf loves animals and I'd never seen elk like this.    We did the 4pm and fair warning, it was COLD. Bring beanies and gloves but we definitely enjoyed it.    Ask questions, they know what they're talking about (at least our guide did) and it was great fun."
249,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Bettendorf, IA ",Something different to do on vacation,"My husband and I just returned from a long ski weekend in Jackson Hole. On our day off from the slopes, we checked out the sleigh rides out of Jackson - booked at the visitors center (well temporarily at the Jackson home ranch welcome center during gov shutdown). It was around $20/p for about an hour tour. perfect for a quick trip out in less than 20degree weather :) They provide plenty of blankets for the ride but bundle up! The guides were very nice and super informative. Get to swoop up close and personal to a couple elk herds and learn a bit about them along the way."
250,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Asheboro, NC ",Winter Sleigh Ride Among the Elks,"For the last several years I have wanted to give Glenda a sleigh ride for her birthday present. Today I was finally able to do that. We took a sleigh ride with our guide Michael out into the National Elk Preserve just north of Jackson Hole. The weather certainly cooperated. Temperatures were in the mid 20s, there was light snowfall and no wind. Cuddled under thick blankets we enjoyed Michael’s knowledgeable presentation on the elk herds in the Grand Tetons. Surrounding us was some of the most extravagantly magnificent scenery in God’s good Creation. In addition to the elk we saw trumpeter swans, coyotes, and several different types of birds. I am reducing my rating by one star because we had been told that we would be in a traditional sleigh rather than a farm wagon on runners. Still, it was a lovely, even majestic experience in the shadows of the magnificent Tetons."
251,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Solo,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Perfect Wildlife Viewing,"A sure place to view local wildlife! Elk herds, bighorn sheep, coyotes, Fox, swans, hawks...just a few of the animals I’ve seen on the Refuge!"
252,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family, ,Sleigh ride,"The sleigh ride part of the visit was much shorter than I expected--we only went a few hundred yards, to the closest group of elk. Then we sat there (in a blizzard) watching the elk for about half an hour. Then we went back. I expected more sleigh ride. It was a bitterly cold and windy day, and they provided blankets which helped, but we were quite uncomfortable by the end of the ride."
253,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family,"Fort Lauderdale, FL ",Excellent experience & learned a lot!,"If you go when it is cold, definitely take some hand and feet warmers. The sleigh ride is really nice and our guide was super informative. They are also very kind to their horses who pull the sleighs, only allowing them to do two rides a day - every other day. They also explained how strong the horses are and why it is fine that only two horses are pulling the sleigh vs. 4 or more. Wonderful place!"
254,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,PA ,Excellent information about the elk and the refuge,"Michael, our sled driver, was very knowledgeable and presented the information in a humorous manner. We learned that the female cows look for a good rack in the bucks they choose. Flint and Steel capably took us into the refuge where we had the opportunity to see the elk up close."
255,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Solo,"Ossining, NY ",Fun tour,"We took the sleigh ride in the National Elk Refuge and although it was quite cold and windy, it was a lot of fun. In addition to seeing many elk up close and personal, we saw two bald eagles perched in a tree, almost waiting for us to photograph them. Our sleigh driver Lee was knowledgeable and entertaining, and the blankets provided were especially appreciated. Enjoyed this tour."
256,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"San Diego, CA ",Magical,What an amazing experience in the wintertime! Our guide was so knowledgable- there was no question that he couldn't answer. He got us close to the elk while still being respectful of their space as wild creatures. At times we were quiet while the snow fell and observed the elk around us- it was a truly magical experience.
257,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family, ,Elk Refuge Visit,"This was worth going to but depending on when you go you may not see many Elk and it may also be bitterly cold - even with the blankets they provide (one young girl on our trip got so cold she was very upset) - be prepared with toe warmers and hand warmers if going in the coldest part of winter. The booking office was really efficient and organised, the tour guides were friendly, the horses were lovely and it was an easy thing to do (if you had enough warm clothes on!!)"
258,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Ooltewah, TN ",Don't Miss This,The best deal in Jackson Hole!! Can't beat this tour for the price. Very informative with a guide that was very knowledgeable of the elk. There are more elk than you will ever see and you get a close up view for extremely good pictures. It was more than I imagined I would ever see.
259,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family,"Booth, TX ",Very informative!,"We enjoyed this outing and learned a lot about Elk and Bison. We saw two bald eagles,and a herd of elk. Our guide knew a lot about the refuge and was a wealth of information."
260,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Morpeth, UK ",Always a good visit,Great guide. In addirption to the Elk we saw Coyotes & a pair of Bald Headed Eagles close up. Trumpeter swans flew past too.
261,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Slidell, LA ",Sleigh ride and elk,Very knowledgeable guide and comfortable sleigh with warm blankets provided. We saw lots of elk up close and got great photos. It was a beautiful sunny day though cold. Learned a lot about the elk and their migration patterns. Still operated even with the Government shutdown
262,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"Liberty Township, OH ",Elk up close!,"If you want to see the Elk up close - do the sleigh ride. Our guide was very helpful and seemed to be able to answer all the questions we asked of him. Depending on the day, it could be VERY cold. They do provide blankets, but you will need to dress warm. The blankets help, but they have been outside all day and are quite cold themselves.    We learned that you can also drive onto the Elk Refuge by traveling east on Broadway past the hospital and turning left onto Elk Refuge Road. You may NOT be very close to the elk though. We drove the Elk Refuge Road three different times and the elk were at a distance. We did see several other wildlife on the trips - coyotes and big horn sheep. If you have a car, this drive is worth it."
263,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family, ,Beautiful!,"We booked the Elk Refuge Tour for Dec 30th. Turned out to be an exceptionally cold and snowy day. We were very apprehensive to attend with the weather, but were very glad we did. The tour company is very organized and efficient. We stepped off the bus and onto our sleigh. They had blankets awaiting us, and off we went once seated. This particular day the elk were further out because of the weather. Our guide was very knowledgeable and had plenty of facts to fill the time on the ride out. The elk were beautiful to watch. The bulls were doing a little sparing in the cold, which was interesting. Overall it was a great experience, definitely recommend it if you are in the area."
264,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family,"Chino Hills, CA ",Very Inspiring,"The day we went to the Refuge it was snowing, lots of wind and about 10 degrees. However, it was beautiful. We took the sleigh ride out to see the Elk. Only thing I would suggest is for the driver of the sleigh to drive around more so that everyone on the sleigh has the same chance of seeing all the Elk as he talks about them. All in all, a very good experience. Incredible views."
265,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Zachary, LA ",Beautiful- Frigid Tour,Nice tour and ride out into the valley to see Elk on the Refuge. Very cold after being out there awhile on an open wagon sleigh pulled by horses. They supply blankets but need to DRESS WARM. Tour guide was pleasant and knowledgeable but tour could’ve been about 30 minutes shorter. A few people on the tour were frozen and ready to go. I enjoyed it and it’s beautiful out there but out in the wide open- did I mention it was COLD?!
266,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Family,"Alexandria, VA ",Delightful sleigh ride to view the elk!,"We had a very windy day, so it was quite cold, but the sleigh ride was surprisingly smooth. Fortunately, the elk weren't too far away from the barn area where you start on the day we went. Be sure to bundle up for this!"
267,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Las Vegas, NV, ",A lot of Elk,Drove around the reserve. You can see large number of both male and female Elk. Took a horse drown slay ride inside the reserve.  Learned a lot of things about Elk I didn't know.
268,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Chicago, IL ",Excellent wildlife viewing.,"Great place to drive around and view elk, coyotes, and mule deer. It is well worth the trip. There are pull off areas on the road where you can set up a spotting scope or use binoculars."
269,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Couples,"Chattanooga, TN ",Elk refuge ride.,The horse drawn ride in the snow to see the elk that had come down from the mountains to find food during the heavy snow months was not as impressive while we were there because the snow was below average and there were not as many elk as usual in the refuge. So I would recommend calling and asking about the number of elk in the refuge before going in the ride.
270,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Couples,"Dallas, TX ",Nice views in the Winter,"I've been here in the winter and summer and understand that it's only in the winter time you can see elk. I didn't observe convenient places to stop and observe the elk this December. From the highway you can see a lot of them. I believe there were carriage rides there in December too to get close to the elk, but we didn't do that. Note that closer to town, each of three days, I saw large trumpeter swans swimming in the water."
271,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Family,"Santa Barbara, CA ",Beautiful scenery and amazing animals,"We drove through the National Elk Refuge and saw elk as well as Bighorn Sheep. We also took the sleigh ride through the refuge, which was beautiful as well as informative about the refuge system and the elk refuge in particular. Definitely worth a visit."

They will give you nice blankets and the ride is very pleasant, educational and entertaining. We love nature and think we know more than most people, but we learned a lot!"
273,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2019 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",Big Horn Sheep,"Came here in early January mid-day, we didn’t see too many Elk however we saw a ton of big horn sheep"

275,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Couples, ,Fun but pricey.,My wife and I had a great time getting quite close to the elk. Our guide was great and very informative. $25 a ticket seems steep for an hour sleigh ride.
276,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Family, ,Nice place to see the elk up close,This was a nice way to spend an hour and a great value for the money spent. Nice for families with older members and or young children.

Our driver was very informative and got us up closer and personal with a group of elk bulls. We even got to see some of them gently fighting. This is a great way to see the elk.
278,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Family,"Fort Worth, TX ",Do the Sleigh Ride!,"Took my family of 5 to do the sleigh ride at the national elk refuge through the visitors center and it was definitely worth it. And it was inexpensive compared to most winter activities you can do. $25 per person for about an hour including the tour and transportation time. The visitors center is cool to look around in while you wait for your bus to take you to the sleigh ride area. Dress warm though! There wasn’t a ton of elk when we went which was right before Christmas, but it was still enough to make it interesting. Our guide told us a lot about them so it was cool to learn about these beautiful creatures. I only wish we could get closer to them! Our resort called the visitors center and booked everything for us so that made it extra easy."
279,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Family, ,Chilly Sleigh Ride Worth the Time,"We toured on a cool day with a breeze - dress warmly on top with multiple layers! They provide blankets, and if there is not enough snow they use wagons instead of sleighs. The Elk gather on the plains that used to be the homesteads of 3 of the original town settlers. It is interesting to hear the history of the area and see the Elk up close. Great photo opportunities to shoot pictures of both wildlife and the Butte to the East of town."
280,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Friends,"Jackson, WY ",Top notch tour- Must experience!,Top notch tour- don’t leave Jackson without experiencing this. Only place in the world to see huge elk herd up close.
281,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Couples,"Jacksonville, FL ",Very informative!,"We bought our tickets at the visitor center and had to wait about 40 mins. You can wait inside or in your car. You are given a number and they will holler it out in the parking lot as well as inside. So you do have to pay attention, especially if your in the car.    We took a shuttle about 5 mins up the road to the sleighs. You are on the bus with your number and one other and they call you off the bus by your number.    I think we had about 10 people in our sleigh pulled by 2 very healthy horses. That's important to me. I hate to see a skinny horse pulling a carriage. These horses are healthy and beautiful.    Our guide was very informative. It truly was an educational experience. It was very cold when we went. Highly recommend you wear a hat AND gloves. The wind whips across the land and its brutally cold. They do provide blankets, but it's still cold. The whole ride start to finish is about an hour. Well worth it. Dont forget to tip your guide, they earn every dime in those elements.    Highly recommend."

284,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Couples,"Hamilton, MT ",So much fun for all ages!,"So it starts off with purchasing tickets, the you get on a bus to the refuge. You get on the sleigh ride that provides blankets when it’s cold, and the guide is super nice! We had Lynn as our guide and he was so nice and very educated on the elks! We learned so much from him! And you get super close to the elk sometimes they will even walk up to the sleigh! And the elk are not afraid of the horses and sleighs. It is actually a long ride and very peaceful out there! Even while it was snowing we were warm and able to get a lot of great pictures. Great pricing as well. I wanted to do it again the next day! But will definitely do it again when we come back and I would recommend it to friends and family. Also at the end of the ride you get to pet the horses! They love it! And then the bus takes you back into town."
285,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Couples,"Englewood, CO ",Beautiful!,We lucked out with a blue sky to visit the refuge! It’s gorgeous and although we only say the elk in the distance we saw many goats! They will lick your bumper if you stop stop! Take the drive it’s beautiful!

You can tell they love their animals there( the horses and the elk) they were very kniwledgeable and it was loads of fun. Got to see the elk really up close.  Would recommend this to people of all ages.

It would have been much better to allow us to researve a specific time.    The ride itself was excellent.
288,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2018 , Family,"Knoxville, TN ",Wonderful adventure to see elk up close in the sleigh,"The sleigh ride on the Elk Refuge was fun family experience. It is easy to arrange the sleigh ride yourself at the visitor center. The sleigh ride is 25 per person. We were able to see the elk up close....when we were there, the sleigh rides had just started. Elk were on the preserve but not as many as will be there in the upcoming months. The sleighs are led by Percheron horses. The horses pulling our sleigh were Apollo and Zeus and they were impressive work horses. They have blankets for you on the sled. The guide was knowledgeable about the elk and answered any questions."

We went in the middle of December and got to see numerous elk and saw some coming over the mountain to join the elk all ready there. We took a sleigh ride through the Elk Refuge and learned about the migratory patterns, wolves, and other interesting elk facts.

298,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2018 , Business,Springdale ,I don't get it.,"The area holds an elk reduction hunt in Grand Teton park, yet they feed the elk over winter at the refuge. The volunteers are continually complaining about the number of wolf kills on the refuge but the system sets it up for that. If the elk weren't fed, and if the wolves were allowed to roam the area, they wouldn't need to shoot bullets in the park, endangering, and/or ruining people's visit to the park. I actually don't go to a national park to watch elk be butchered or to drive through blood."
299,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Bozeman, MT ",Great Info Center,This was a headquarters with information about the NER and a great gift shop. They had the machines you can imprint a penny with their logo. I made 2 pennies to put in our collectors book.

300,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2018 , Couples,Minnesota ,No Elk yet,This is a huge refuge in the Grand Teton National Park where the Elk come down from the surrounding hills to winter. We were about two weeks too early to see them. Hence the average rating. There was really nothing to see. I’m sure it’s awesome when they’re all down.

306,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2018,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",Protection for one of the largest elk herds in the world,"The National Elk Refuge was created in 1912 to protect habitat and provide sanctuary for one of the largest elk herds in the world. It covers 24,700 across and borders the town of Jackson, Wyoming, on the northeast while Bridger-Teton National Forest is to the east and Grand Teton National Park borders the refuge to the north. It is home to an average of 7,500 elk each winter. Elk migrate from as far away as southern Yellowstone National Park. The original size of the elk herd has been estimated to have been in excess of 25,000 but the herd was severely reduced in size due to the hostile climate and lack of food supply, in addition to hunting pressures by homesteaders and surrounding Native American tribes. A movement to protect the remaining herd and establish greater numbers was commenced in the early 1900s. When the Miller homestead was sold for $45,000 to the federal government, the refuge was established. The elk herd survives the harsh winters of Jackson Hole through a supplementary feeding program and a lottery based hunting program, which is highly regulated. The refuge also provides horse-drawn sleigh rides to the public during the winter months so that visitors have the opportunity to see portions of the herd up close. The refuge is nearly 25,000 acres of meadows and marshes along the valley floor, sagebrush and rock outcroppings along the mountain foothills. In addition, the largest single herd of bison under federal management, comprising 1,000 plus, also winter in the refuge, along with pronghorn antelope, mule deer and even a few trumpeter swans along Flat Creek. Rare sightings of wolf packs and grizzly bears have occurred."
307,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2018 , Couples, ,Worth the ride,"Drove through the reserve in the morning. Great views of the Tetons, once you get up into the forest. The road can be a little rough once you start the climb, just take you time. The views and scenery are worth it. Seen a few antelopes off in the distance."

However, I have seen them previously three years ago, when I visited during early May. The Refuge is non the less a beautiful region just to take a leisurely drive through with breathtaking vistas of the Grand Teton range, and safe to even jog or cycle through."

312,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Southwell, UK ",Fascinating tour,"We went to the visitors centre to check if the tour of the Miller’s Homestead was open and were told to ask for “Uncle Jim”. Well he gave us an interesting overview of the history outside, while his wife told us about the family events inside the house. All in all an interesting visit. At that time of year (September) the Elk are still up in the mountains so if you want to see Elk you need to be there in November apparently. We had already seen some up in Yellowstone though."
313,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Linthicum Heights, MD ",Maybe no elk,"So....I thought there were elk a the elk refuge. I was wrong. Apparently they don't keep elk there, so if they haven't migrated down (winter), don't expect to see any. If you are lucky to be there in the winter, then I imagine it's an incredible sight. BUT it is still worth stopping here. A lot of information, displays, exhibits, and helpful people - and a gift shop of course (& bathrooms). So stop here even if there are no elk!"

Unfortunately it was in the high 90’s out and all of the elk were up in the hills because it was cooler for them. This is a huge property and we rented a jeep 4x4 to explore some of the gravel roads and back areas. If you are coming to view the wildlife, high August is not a good time unless you get up at the crack of dawn. Make sure you have water and cell service can be non existent  so download your maps before hand in case your gps does not work or bring a map !!"

A stop at this Visitor Center is worthwhile at any time of year because there are nice indoor displays related to elks, and on the day I visited, there was a Volunteer with elk antlers to show--each weighing 15 lbs.--one for each side of the head. I'm not sure I would do as well as the elk with 30 lbs of antlers on my head,"

The last time we were in Jackson we actually stayed close to the refuge, this time we stayed in town. We took a half day wildlife safari tour and the elk refuge was one of the stops. Plenty of bison! We were there a few years ago, also in July, and enjoyed seeing the bison at that time. It is well worth a visit even if the elk have already migrated, lots to see."

Apparently I didn't read carefully enough to know that the reserve is primarily for wintering elk. Now I know. I suggest that a noticeable sign be placed at the entrance advising of the winter being prime time. Also, if the road is being watered down to reduce dust, be prepared to get a car wash immediately after visiting. The soil on your vehicle will feel like concrete but thankfully comes off in a car wash. Maybe I'll get to revisit during the winter in the future."

In the summer the multi level visitor center is the main attraction

348,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017,not available,California ,Great Wildlife Viewing!,"First let me start by saying there are times of the year that you are likely to NOT see an elk. If you are expecting to see elk on a summer trip through Jackson, you will probably be disappointed. That said, when they are there it is an amazing place to just sip a coffee and watch for long period of time, as you never know what you'll see. It's also a great place to take photographs, and not just of elk. A large variety of birds and (other wildlife) can sometimes been seen. Be sure to check out the exhibits and gift shop too!"

The entry was free and it was about 2 km from our hotel (Snow King), so we though we would check it out.    We arrived in the late afternoon (apparently more animals around then).    When we drove into the park (unsealed road) we weren’t sure what to expect, however it wasn’t long and we came across some big horned sheep (great start).    However even though just weeks before another tourist saw hundreds of Elk, we didn’t see one.    We drove for miles and must admit we were a little disappointed not to see more animals. Not sure where they were. We did stick to the roads, however other people did get out of their cars and go hiking."

Timing is everything.,"We got to the Refuge on May 17th, 2018 and the elk had left the refuge several days/a week before. So it was a vast empty valley floor. We even got up at dawn one day to maybe see a Mom and calf who decided to stay behind - but no luck. I will say that the week we traveled to Yellowstone/Tetons was more perfect than not. We were on the cusp of the tourist crush and even though we had one road still closed and the elk had already departed - there was enough majesty and dreamlike views that it was absolutely ok to know the elk did what elk do: migrate!"

359,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2018 , Couples,"Dallas, TX ",I Spy,"This will be an untraditional review for the National Elk Refuge. We happened to visit a few weeks after the herd of elk had migrated on to the Grand Tetons, but trust me it was worth the trip.    When we arrived in Jackson, we asked our hotel to recommend a good place/trail/area for us to walk each morning as a course of exercise. They directed us to the bicycle path that runs parallel to the National Elk Refuge. It starts at the welcome center and runs up through the Grand Tetons where all the elusive elk were hanging out.    The paved trail is full of mountainous eye candy. The scenery of verdant valleys, snow capped mountains, and marshlands filled with geese made us forget that we were exercising, because we were so enchanted by everything we saw.    While we saw only two other people on the path during our times out there, this is a hidden gem. Sure we walked all over town each day going from restaurant to store to hotel and back. But this bike trail allowed us to burn off the calories while being totally distracted by the breathtaking scenery.    And for the record, I did spy one elk though he was dead and hidden in the bush between the trail and the outside fence of the refuge. All those years of watching CSI finally paid off!"

The next morning we went back and there weren't as many, but still probably over 200 elk still in the field. We drove down the road a little ways and turned on another road and were greeted to hundreds of Elk herding across the road. A very majestic sight to see. HIGHLY RECOMMEND"

There were many elk and we were up close and personal.

To experience this you must be there in September. Bring some binoculars. These are magnificent animals and for those of you that like game...try one of the local restaurants for some elk meat...you cannot find anything better.    The herds are impressive and you must take some time to watch them as they move about. These animals must be listened to as well as watched.

This is a must if visiting the Jackson area during winter and early March months.    Dress warm. You will head out to the Elk herd by a horse drawn wagon or sleigh. Today was windy so it was kind of cold.    Our “tour guide” was fantastic. He was very informative and knowledgeable.    I’d do this activity again if in the area."

They do provide blankets but be sure you wear head and face gear to block winds. Guides talk alot. Very knowledgeable of everything around you and all the animals, but alot of talking. The ride is alot bumpier than was expected.If you have not done this you should. Love the horses."
373,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2018 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Up close and personal with the elk!,We drove through the Elk Refuge but the elk were fairly far from the road so we couldn't see them too well. There were some bighorn sheep up on the mountain too as well as trumpeter swans in a pond. We decided to go ahead and take the wagon tour. $23/person and they leave as soon as they have a full load. We didn't have to wait too long for our turn. It wasn't terribly cold on the wagon and they have heavy blankets to help out if you're chilly. The cowboy that drives the wagon is knowledgable and can tell you anything you want to know about the history or wildlife in the area. They took us right out to the herd and the bulls were fine with us being there. They pretty much ignore the wagon. We were able to park the wagon nearby and take as any pictures as we wanted while they chewed their cud. The cows were off in the distance and we didn't get close to them. Whole tour lasts about an hour. Very worth it!
374,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2018 , Family,Florida ,Great Spot for Learning and Shopping.,We were here in winter and did the sleigh ride thru the Refuge. Very informative and a nice way to spend the afternoon. Plenty of active elk around. We also saw eagles and a coyote eating an elk carcass.

379,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Friends, ,Unbelievable experience,"I cannot rate this place highly enough.  We visited in February and bought tickets on the day at the visitor centre. The process to buy tickets was quick and easy at the main desk.  Whilst we waited for our bus to be called (a short ride in a shuttle bus takes you a couple of miles down the road from the visitor centre to the refuge), we browsed the visitor centre. It is a mind blowing place, full of information, gifts, souveniers, a view of the refuge from upstairs and a small, informative theatre. There are a few stuffed animals (elk, wolf, bear etc) which really show you the scale of the animals you are about to go and see!    Once our bus was called we headed out to the refuge where we met our driver ""Bingham"" and our two huge paint dract horses who pulled our waggon. As it wasn't too snowy, we had a waggon opposed to a sleigh. The ride was very bumpy! But it all added to the atmosphere and they provided thick woolen blankets for warmth.  I could not believe how close we got to the elk. The bucks were stunning with their huge antlers and our driver provided lots of information as well as making us all laugh throughout. We moved along several times to different parts of the herd, seeing males and females, as well as a coyote!    I cannot recommend this activity highly enough. All of the staff went above and beyond to be friendly and helpful and I took home some truly memorable posters as souveniers.    If you do one thing in Jackson - make sure this is it!"

The sled drivers are great, and make the 1 to 1 and a half hour tour fly by. The ride can get bumpy, but stops are frequent and even made upon request. The horse draw sleds are a unique experience in themselves, and add to the fun of the trip. Blankets are provided, and proved helpful to keep warm in the winter cold."
383,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2018 , Couples,"Orlando, Florida ",Worth the visit,We drove as well as did the sleigh ride. Both were well worth it.

He talked about the history of the refuge. He answered any of our questions. We actually got to see a coyote while we were there. The guide said it was unusual to see them there. I was so excited to see one that close because we saw one from a long way away on our snowmobile tour in Yellowstone. There is an elk there that has no ears but he can still hear. This was definitely worth the money.

We were able to get very close to so many elk. We even saw two bald eagles! The ride was comfortable as they provided blankets and so peaceful with snow all around us. We were comfortable and warm. Our guide was kind and knowledgeable about elk, the history of the refuge sight and many other pertinent questions that were asked. A must see while visiting during the elk migration down the mountains!"
388,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Family,"Riverton, WY ",DO THIS IN JACKSON!,"The horse-drawn sleigh ride into the Elk Refuge in winter has long been on my bucket list. It was windy and cold, but that didn't detract from the pleasure of seeing these magnificent animals up-close.    Make reservations online and go to the center in town to pick up a shuttle to the refuge. You can't park at the refuge. The drivers were knowledgable, the horses in great shape, and there are plenty of blankets to cover up with.    BUT, make sure you dress for the cold.    Don't miss self-driving on the road behind the refuge, where we saw big-horn sheep."
389,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Solo,"Dallas, TX ",See elk up close,"So cool to see hundreds of elk chilling right by the road (went in February). Did not take a sleigh ride, just took pictures from the pull-off near the fence. It's awesome to see these animals pretty close-up."
390,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Greenville, OH ","up close with many ,amy elk","this trip is one hour, in my view, about 15 minutes, times four. But, quite the experince, beautiful sunshine day, hundreds or thousands of elk, nice time in the wagon/sleigh, pulled by a nice team, with good driver telling us about the area and the refuge. I consider this a must do when in Jackson Hole"
391,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2017 , Family,"Tampa, FL ","wrong time for elk refuge, but the education was valuable","Bough tickets ahead(please do this) took taxi there from Hotel. When we got there they warned us not many elk had come down from mountains yet, making sure we wanted to spend the $100 on this adventure. Went ahead and went, there were 3 elk. on observation deck we saw 10 with the telescope. Waiting area was comfortable and bus you to site. People very nice. Sled ride very rough, it case you have back issues, may want to avoid. We were out 30 mins,it was minus 13 degrees, so we were good to be done. People kept telling us we would get hot cocoa afterwards, this does happen. It was worth it cause you are not going to see Elk in Florida. Just enjoyed the time together as family and hearing about ELKs. would do it again"
392,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples,Raleigh ,Nice Visitors Center,"Check out days with special exhibits. Great place to view the Elk, even better to take a sleigh ride!!! Reasonable gift shop."
393,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Family,"New Orleans, LA ",A fun wagon/sleigh tour,"While I've done this tour numerous times, it was my husband's first time in Jackson and he wanted to see the elk! While it was unusual for Jackson to lack snow in Feb, we had to take a wagon rather than a sleigh out to the elk. Our guide was very informative and answered all of our questions regarding the history / geography of the area. This is a ""must do"" for visitors in Jackson Hole. I noted an earlier review mentioned the bumpy wagon ride, which is true unfortunately if they do not have enough snow to pad the ground for the sleigh. But, we took a 4 month old baby on the tour and he slept the entire ride - obviously didn't mind the extra bumps! Don't forget your camera, this is an unusual experience!"
394,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Baton Rouge, LA ",Amazing To See So Many Elk,Excellent viewing from pullouts off of highway. They also offer sleigh rides that get you very near large numbers of the elk. Remember to dress for the extreme cold if you are going on the sleigh ride.
395,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples, ,Friendy Wranglers and Tour Guides,Thoroughly enjoyed our tour to see the elk in the national elk refuge. What a unique opportunity to get up close and personal with these magnificent animals. The horses were well behaved and the ride was safe. The Wranglers treated the horses well and can field a variety of questions. A must do when you visit Jackson in the winter.
396,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Family,"Casper, Wyoming ",Great Experience,"We do the refuge thing every winter, and love it every time. We always learn something new, and really enjoy the guides. They all have the best personalities. I don't remember who we had the morning of 2/17, but he was driving Thunder & Lightning. (How sad is it that we remember the horses?) He was funny, engaging and made the experience great! When you visit the refuge yearly like we do, you look for your favorite elk from the years before, like the one with the missing ear, Mongo, or the one with the weird drop tine. While we didn't get to see Mongo or the drop tine this year, the guides give you new favorites to look forward to next year. To anyone considering a Jackson Hole trip in the winter, do the refuge."
397,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Blackwood, NJ ",think twice,We spent 5 mins near the elk and the rest of the time bouncing through the field. We were disappointed.

400,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Solo, ,Sleigh ride on the National Elk Refuge.,The sleigh ride on the National Elk Refuge is the only way to get close to these wonderful animals. You ride out on a wagon pulled by two draft horses. They supply warm blankets and take you right up to the elk. The guides have great knowledge of the elk and the history of the refuge. Tickets are sold at the Visitor's Center and it is a very reasonable tour.
401,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Orlando, Fl. ",Day Trip,Excellent opportunity to get up close to the Elk herd which is very large. You ride in a wagon either on wheels or sleigh depending on snow conditions
402,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Family,"Kaysville, UT ",More than just a museum. Its a must on your list!,"The Elk refuge is a great place to stop by and visit the displays, and you can see the elk from several vantage points.  But if you really want a life long memory, call ahead and make reservations for the Tour that you get to go on for free! We saw elk, bison, big horn sheep and tons more. Bring your camera and don't forget to get your National Park passport book stamped and get some cool photos from the gift shop!    The gift shop is wheelchair and stroller accessible, and there are a few places up close to take great photos."
403,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Family,"St. Petersburg, FL ",Excellent tour,"Despite the government shutdown, we were able to get into the Refuge getting our tickets at the Welcome Center in town instead of the normal Visitors' Center. Quick, yet informative, van ride to the Refuge since you can't park there. Great, experienced tour guide into the Refuge on a large buggy pulled by two horses. Very interesting on a beautiful sunny day."

407,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Family,"Mount Tremper, NY ",An amazing vista with thousands of elk in their natural habitat,"The National Elk Refuge is a vast plain nestled among the mountains outside Jackson Hole, that is home to approximately 7,500 Elk during the winter months. It is a must-see, and only a few minutes outside of Jackson. Watching the Elk graze and move slowly across the vast plain, you begin to imagine what life was llike hundreds of years ago in this rugged frontier land. If you have more time, the Refuge also offers carriage rides within the perimiter of the grazing range itself, so you can see the ellk up close."
408,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Friends, ,Close to town,We took off a day of skiing heard that this was interesting so we went. It was great. Learned lots about the life of Elk and we saw a Bald Eagle. Very interesting.

410,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Melbourne, Australia ","Interesting, informative.","Tour lasts about 30 min. You get a good close up with the elk, whilst they tell you about them. Touristy but worth the effort."
411,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Dublin, CA ",Be sure to take a sleigh or wagon ride,"Sometimes the elk are near the visitor’s center viewing platform, but other times they aren’t. Our Globus tour included a sleigh ride, but due to lack os snow, it was a wagon ride. We rode out a good way and saw hundreds of elk including males locking antlers."
412,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Solo, ,Great for pictures.,Great place to take photos. The elk were plentiful! Easy to pull off the disenof the road and snap pictures.
413,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Shannon, IL ",Fascinating Refuge!,"We enjoyed a horse drawn wagon ride through the Elk Refuge. If there is enough snow they use sleighs. The tickets are purchased at the Visitor Center in Jackson Hole. That is a great place to get ideas, maps, and other information about the area. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable on everything, plus they offer free tours to places depending on the dates you are there. The observation deck outside the center offers beautiful views of the Elk Refuge and Jackson Hole. Their gift shop is great!  Our guide at the Elk Refuge was very informative and we were able to enjoy those fascinating animals up close! Dress warmly, because despite the heavy blankets, it gets cold!"
414,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Couples, ,First Time in the Refuge Tour,"My husband and I very much enjoyed the tour. There wasn’t enough snow for a sleigh ride, but we were able to take a horse drawn wagon ride. Lynn was an excellent guide. He taught us so much about the Elk, the refuse, and the area. It was quite windy, so dress appropriately. They do have blankets for your legs."
415,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Family,"Alexandria, MN ",Amazing!,"We checked into this after a friend mentioned it and are so glad we decided to do this with our kids. Thousands of elk and our kids were mesmerized with just watching them. Very informative tour guide who drove our wagon, which was supposed to be a sleigh but this wasn’t an option due to little snow."
416,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Solo,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia ",Up close and personal with elk!,"The tour leaves from the National Park office in Jackson (with a fab gift shop), and includes transfer to the Elk sleigh or wagon site on the refuge (choice based on available snow cover. NB: venue is opposite the Wildlife Art Museum but visitors are prohibited from leaving the tour to go to the Museum and must return to NP office). The guides are very knowledgable about the elk, and find great spots near elk to talk and let you watch the animals up close and personal during the tour hour. Saw bull elks play fighting, resting & grazing- it is just a magic experience to be so close to wild animals. Heavy rugs are provided for cold on the refuge, but advised to dress warmly as it gets cold out there. Wagons can be a little bumpy on the grass but you get a good amount of time to watch the animals from a still position. The horses are also beautiful (thanks Thunder & Lightning!). So worth taking this tour!"
417,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2017 , Family,"Tucson, AZ ",I've Never Seen Even One Elk Here,"I've driven by the Elk Refuge and not once have I ever seen an elk.

419,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Couples,"Lenox, MA ",Awesome Tour,"The Elk sleigh is a must for anyone visiting Jackson Hole. Our guide Seth was very knowledgeable and a fun guy he gets up close to the Elk for great photos!  On a side note, the staff at the Visitors Center could all use a class in Customer Service and Personality they all acted very bored and unprofessional with their job, one does not like to encounter what is supposed to be a professional who is familiar and up to date on the area, who had just come in from smoking outside and reeked on cigarette smoke, so unprofessional!"
420,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2018 , Friends, ,Awesome wild life,Stop here if you are into looking at wildlife up close. We always make a point to swing by here every time we pop into Jackson
421,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Couples,"Baltimore, Maryland ",Big Horn Sheep!,This may be the National Elk Refuge but the back road is full of Big Horn Sheep. Go past town square and up Broadway to you reach the back ent. At the second pull out Big Horn sheep were everywhere! Enjoy
422,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Couples,"Brooklyn, NY ",Great to see the animals up close,"If we could do it again, my wife and I would definitely do it again because it's an hour well spent where you get to be in close proximity to one of North America's most majestic mammals, and learn from a very knowledgeable guide things about the elk you might not know. Then the corny guide jokes start to get a little stale after about 30 minutes. Overall a great experience but an hour is all you need.    PS - we got lucky and saw two coyotes come running through the herd."
423,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Couples,"Miami, FL ",One of our favorite attractions,"Highly recommend visiting the Elk Refuge. It's a lovely way to take in beautiful views and the nature around you from the horse drawn carriages. The staff is excellent! It's a great activity that won't take too much of your time either.

427,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Couples,Chicago ,Great sleight ride past innumerable elks,Winter is the best time to see this elk herd as they tend to be up in the mountains during spring and summer. The tickets are purchased at the Elg Refuge visitor center at the edge of Jackson. If it is January be prepared for cold. They do provide blankets for additional cover.
428,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Friends,"Gloucester, UK ","Cold, windy, uncomfortable - and wonderful!","Wrap up warm if you go for a sleigh ride at this refuge - even though you get blankets the wind whistles across the plain and the cart bumps up and down on the rutted ground!

430,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Friends,"Oxnard, CA ",Be Careful - January 2018,"The elk can be seen from the road. Lots of them. There's a couple tour groups that will take you near them on a large sleigh.    But we opted to drive into the refuge from the east side of town (free). We spotted some big horn sheep next to the road. A car stopped to take pictures of them. Several of the big horn crept up and started licking the salt off the stopped car. We slowly idled by. Suddenly, one of the big horn rammed the tail light of the stopped car breaking it! You can see some of the broken red lens on the ground. Moral: they're called ""wildlife"" for a reason!"
431,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Couples,"Boston, MA ",Very informative on life of the elk,Great 1 hour sled ride into preserve. Learned a lot. Dress warmly. Thousands of elk viewed close up. Friendly staff
432,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Friends, ,Pretty cool experience,Seth was a wonderful tour guide. It was awesome to see these beautiful animals up close and personal. Wish we could have moved around more as we were stopped most of the time. But overall a fun experience.
433,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Friends,"Fort Payne, AL ",Skip this home on the range!,"Maybe it was because of the lack of snow but this hour was hardly worth the time and cold. We could understand using wagons versus sleighs because of the absence of snow but it seems the guide had used this as an excuse to show no enthusiasm and ""get it over"" as quickly as possible. The folks in the Welcome Center were exceptionally nice and helpful!"
434,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Couples,"San Diego, CA ",Wonderful way to see the elk in the winter!,This is a great value for the price. Our guide was informative and made sure we saw a lot of elk during our wagon ride. Great way to see these wonderful creatures close up!

Elk antlers valuable commodity and are prominently displayed at entrances to Town Square."
438,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2017 , Family,"Washington, DC ",winter???? Make sure there is snow,"So it's one of those things where if all things align it could be a great trip. So we had 3 elk who were way up a hill along with a carcass. Then we were there in winter, but did not have snow which would have made for a smooth sleigh ride rather than a bumpy wagon ride.... but it's something to do and was pretty amusing, even if just for the adventure.o)"
439,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018 , Couples,"Peru, IL ",Just enough snow to enjoy the elk,We had to get the tickets for this at the visitors center.

A must go to!!! Certainly go on a sunny day because big horn sheep gather in the road and LICK the salt off your car. Cars go and park on the side of the road and get up close and personal with the sheep. It was an unbelievable once in a lifetime experience. Not a petting zoo, these are wild animals!"
442,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2018,not available, ,Fun sleigh ride!,"Our sleigh driver/guide was from Phoenix but you would never know because he was quite knowledgeable about the refuge and it’s history.

Refuge is a bit of a misnomer as it is a large reserve with, at this time of year, several thousand Elk. The refuge also has big horn sheep. You can walk in the refuge but must stick to the roads. You can also take a sleigh ride in the refuge, probably best if lots of snow or they put wheels on the sleigh."

Because there was not a lot of snow, the elk are still up in the mountains feeding. And , because there wasn't a lot of snow, it was a wagon ride instead of a sleigh ride. Our guide was great! Very knowledgeable! Our ride was bumpy ( made you appreciate how the pioneers traveled!), but fun. (Although my husband toon quite a jolt to his troubled neck). The team of horses was beautiful!

I know that the amount of elk you see is completely out of the hands of the refuge ( since the animals are wild) but it seemed a little pricy for what we saw. Also they provide you with blankets but it gets really windy out there in the afternoon so really layer up to enjoy the experience.
465,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2017 , Family,"London, UK ",Amazing Experience,A must for anyone visiting Jackson in the winter. My family loved all of it. We took the sleigh ride and enjoyed the buffalo blankets. Huge elk only feet away the whole time.

468,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2017 , Couples,"Florissant, CO ",Worth the time!,This is a great place to bring the kids or the wife. The animals living in the hole are very worth the price. Winter is the time to take the ride on the sled!

474,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2017 , Family,"Grayslake, IL ",Great trip saw lots of wildlife,Nice tour self driven round the refuge about 20 miles including the run up the hill to Curtis Canyon outlook which gives a great view over the plain and the butte. A bit slippery up the road and you probably need 4WD this time of year to the campground at the top. Well worth a visit. Saw elk and big horn deer.
475,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2017 , Couples,"Draper, UT ",Cool place to see elk,Always love this time of year when the elk start showing up. Go east through town and turn left into the refuge. Hit the dirt road and as you get to the small mountain on the right look for the Bighorn sheep on the ridges.
476,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Family,"Pittsburg, TX ",worth the stop,"no elk when we visited, but still a neat place to go learn about all the critters in the area. got some need t shirts and gifts."
477,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2017 , Family,"Heber City, UT ",Fun,"A great drive and you get to see some wildlife. We saw deer, elk and some pronghorn. Drive slow cause because you can’t stop and take pictures. We took some side roads up into the mountains and had amazing views of the Tetons"
478,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2017 , Family,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Great visitor center,"Very well done visitor center. Just know the elk are not in the meadow until winter and snow pushes them down from the high country. Then they are fed over the winter, they stay in area, and the herd averages from 5,000 to 9,000 head of elk. The visitor's center is well done. If you are unfamiliar with western states wildlife, stop in and get a real education. Upon entry are full size taxidermy displays of elk. Make sure you go upstairs, serviced by ramps, and get photos of the two trophy elk. I am an avid elk hunter and was fascinated and even a little educated by the exhibits. Staff of volunteers is very friendly and informative. Not only tips on wildlife viewing and visiting Teton, or Yellowstone, but good recommendations for places to eat in the local area!"
479,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Solo,"Kelly, WY ",Great experience,"This is by far one of the best experiences to do in Winter, getting up close to the Elk is wonderful, hearing them buggle and seeing the bulls sparring is great."
480,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Beautiful,"When we stopped in the Visitor Center, the volunteer was wonderful! She let us know that the elk hadn’t been pushed down from the mountains, by snow, yet, so we were not surprised when we didn’t see any elk. We did, however, see quite a few antelope (and they were playing).    We really enjoyed our drive and time in the refuge. It is beautiful in there and the views of the mountains are pretty incredible."
481,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2017,not available,"Albany, NY, ",Nature Nature Nature,10.5.17 and 10.6.17    Went by here several times but the Elk were nowhere to be seen. Wondering if all the exhaust smells from the vehicles is driving them to higher ground. Still a wonderful refuge but for us humans we saw zero Elk the 2 days we were there. Maybe the Elk no longer want to be social LOL?    the Doctor hit me with some LOVE ❤️and a 👍 helpful VOTE!
482,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Muscle Shoals, AL ",Great Stop,This is a great place to see wildlife. They have nice exhibits in the visitors center.

483,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Bowling Green, KY, ",Wonderful mission. Limited signage. No elk the week of 10/2/17,"Wonderful mission and beautiful wilderness acreage for the care of Elk. Oddly, the visitors center is actually where you get information on the refuge. (This is quite unclear) as you drive into and out of Jackson and through Refuge land."
484,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Long Island, NY ",Stunning Views!,"This vast land is so pristine, so beautiful it's amazing! To experience any part of this refuge would bring wonderful photo ops as well memories!"
485,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Huntersville, NC ",Well worth our time.,There is so much information in this attraction. The exhibit is extremely well done and presents lots of viewpoints. Be sure to see all floors. The Elks show up in January or later but don't let that stop you from visiting. It is extremely interesting. We visited in September and decided that we wouldn't see any elk....next day we saw one near our condo in Wilson. What a thrill.

Snowing the morning we went, what a treat. A winter wonderland in September. Suggest Scenic Safari ATV rentals, we took a side by side ."
490,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Dundee, MI ",Meh.,We didn't see any elk here. It was probably due to the changing weather. The exhibits are ok. The gift shop seemed overly crowded and didn't have much variety. I did pick up some brochures that were helpful in planning the rest of our trip in the area.
491,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Washington DC, DC ",Spectacular view,"Just a mile away from the Jackson townsquare is a large refuge for Elks.In winter Elks gather here in the refuge to escape the harsh winter.You can drive through the refuge.There is no fee.The road inside the refuge is not asphalted however the scenery around is just breath taking.On a clear sunny day you can see the Teton's on the left while you drive through the refuge.There are several turnouts where you can park your vehicle and soak in the amazing views surrounding you.If you are lucky you can see Elks,Deers,ProngsHorns,Coyotes."
492,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Philadelphia, PA ","Lots of bison, and even pronghorn...but no elk!","I just found it funny that the elk refuge had NO elk when we visited lol.

493,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Friends, ,Sledtour after belgian horses,Took a sled tour through the elk park and it was amazing how close we got to the elks. Our guide/sled driver had long experience and could answer all our questions!
494,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Kellyville, OK, ",No Elk,We drove through the refuge knowing the chances of seeing elk were slim. The drive through the refuge is nice. We arrived too early at the Miller homestead to tour it but did see four sandhill cranes fly over and land nearby. There are several pullouts to stop and check out the scenery. We drove in a few miles then turned around and came out.
495,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Carefree, AZ ",even in the summer it is amazing,we visited Jackson Hole in September in between seasons. we did not see elk or antelope in the park however the bird life was amazing. there was a mating pair of swans as well as 10+ varieties of bird life. well worth the visit would have leerily loved to see it in the winter.
496,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Friends, ,Drive carefully,"This is a place where elk can find food during the severe mountain weather. But, drive carefully. The elk wander onto the road and pose a traffic hazard."
497,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"El Cerrito, CA ",Peaceful and Relaxing,"We camped at Gros Ventre - part of the Grand Tetons National Park. This campground is right there at the Elk Refuge. It is a beautiful area, with lots of opportunities for wildlife viewing and photography."
498,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"California, ",Recommend - this visitor center is impressive and a little below the radar,"▪️Location: Highway 89 on North Cache. Same building as the ""Visitor Center"".  ▪️Parking: Easy, large parking lot in front of the building.  ▪️Highlights: Impressive elk, (of course) and other animal exhibits. And, helpful directions where to view animals in the area. (Not in the Elk Refuge during our visit.)  ▪️Staffing: Friendly, helpful people.  ▪️Cost: Free.  ▪️Recommend? Yes"
499,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Winston Salem, NC ",Horrible roads,"We saw no wildlife, which is not the issue. There are some stunning vistas, but difficult to enjoy on the rutted, washboard gravel road. 6mph was top speed for most of the trip. In addition, there men shooting pistols, so any chance to see wildlife was lost."
500,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017,not available, ,Well worth the stop,Excellent visitor center with overlooks to the refuge. Even though it wasn't the time of year to see Elk there they do an excellent job of describing the Elk migration. Wonderful art work & well worth the stop.
501,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Portland, ME ",Must be interesting in season.,Nothing doing in September. The elk start moving when cold and snow begin to set in so if you are interested time your visit accordingly.
502,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Lander, WY ",Great place.,"The road travels along the edge of the refuge. This is a good route for a scenic walk or bike ride. Also, there is the historic Miller (homestead) Ranch. This is worth your time to visit if you like history."

504,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Powhatan, VA ",Amazing acreage,"We visited today hoping to see wildlife but didn't see anything...but that was ok. Elk spend their winter at the refuge where they are fed. The holding containers for the feed are currently being filled. We stopped at the Historic Miller Ranch, a log cabin house which has been renovated. The guides are a wealth of information and it was enjoyable hearing the history of the house and land. When the Miller's sold the house in 1914 it became the National Elk Refuge headquarters."
505,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Family,"Nashville, TN ",Would be a great site in the Winter when all the Elk are there!,"We didn't get the full effect since we visited in late August. However, it must be an amazing site to see all of the elk in basically one spot during the winter. The guides told us that you can see wolves come down into the preserve to prey on the weaker elk that succumb to the harsh winters. Sad, for sure, but definitely part of the cycle of life."
506,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Lancaster, PA ",The Elk Refuge Had No Elk,"At this time of the year the elk have migrated to the mountain areas and cannot be seen at the refuge. However, you will see the vastness of the refuge when travelling from the southern entrance of the Grand Tetons to Jackson, or from the airport to Jackson. (Or vise versa.) More information regarding the refuge can be found at the visitor centers."
507,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Washington DC, DC ",Great views of scenery and animals,"One of the best viewing locations in Jackson Hole. This is not to be missed! It can be toured by car or bike.    The Elk Refuge gets very few visitors since you need to search for the entrance and drive miles down a dirt road (the road is very well maintained for the first 6 miles, but you need an SUV to go further for the best views). The center of the eclipse went through there and there were no more than 50 people stretched over the six miles!"
508,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Charlotte, NC ",Magical experience,"The sleigh ride into the elk refuge in mid January was a magical, once in a lifetime experience. Don't miss this tour!"
509,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Washington DC, DC ",Eclipse week trip,"We saw the eclipse from the Miller Ranch house on the Refuge property, so it will always have a sacred place in my heart. The visitor center is one of best, big, with a lot to offer, whether you want to learn about wildlife conservation, plan your trip and travel, or buy gifts and mementos. Good birding in summer, mostly field and wetland species. Summer is not the season for hoofstock. We got to see staff and volunteers managing eclipse viewers on their property, which demanded the best from them. They delivered; could not have been more helpful, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable about the JH ecosystem and all its glorious offerings."
510,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Family,"Boulder, CO ",August is not the time to visit the Elk Refuge,"It is a beautiful property, but in August the Elk were not there, they left a bare huge field. The ducks in the water ponds at the edge were great"
511,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Woodland Park, CO ",Wrong time of year,August is obviously the wrong time of year. We were told to take the drive and would see animals and birds other than elk. We saw nothing. Not even a bird. Would certainly like to try again in a better season.
512,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Orem, UT ",Probably wrong time of the year,"We visited Jackson for the Solar Eclipse and ended up camping north east of Jackson on Curtis mountain. We drove through the National Elk Refuge for three days and the only wild life we observed were ducks and a couple of antelope. In all likelihood the best time to see Elk, if that's what your looking for, is in the fall and winter months. We did see plenty of Federal Wildlife Officers."
513,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Couples,hawaii ,Miller house,"Go to the Miller House in thr elk refuge. Very knowledgable volunteers. Free, definitely worth your time. See how people lived in the past."
514,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Solo,"New York City, NY ",Great for a run or bike,"Apparently there are a lot of Elk to see here in the winter time. In the summer, this is a great gravel road to run or bike on and take in the breathtaking scenery."

517,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Couples, ,Worth the visit!,You don't realize how large and majestic these creatures are until you see them up close. The sleigh ride took about 30-40 minutes. You get shuttled from the main building. Dress warm!
518,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Sarasota, FL, ",Not now,There's nothing there to see - I've read in the winter it's much better but if you arrive today all you see is a big open field!
519,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Glorious!,This is more of a winter time activity; the elk are up on the mountains during the day in the summer. The refuge is in one of the great scenic settings in the world. How could you NOT love it?
520,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Family,"Howell, NJ ",Elk Refuge,"Not a place to visit in the summer months. The Elk are no where to be seen. Would be much better in the winter months when the Elk come down out of the mountains looking for food. I hear they are abundant (thousands) and easy to see. Disappointed, but it might bring me back in the winter!"
521,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Family,"San Francisco, CA ",not a single elk to be seen.,"So much for elk refuge. This place is very big. But there is not a single elk, or anything else in Aug. Maybe during the colder months, they will have animals. But in August, don't bother."
522,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2016 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",Hiking,"A great experience over all! I had never been to this side of the Teton valley and it was incredible! Driving up to it you will pass by professional photographers, elk, mountain goats, and sheep. This is at least from my experience. I wanted the ridge on the back side of the refuge that has an incredible overlook of the valley. Driving through was great as my partner had never seen this kind of wildlife or this close. There was snow on yhe ground and it is cold. It is a simple 15min drive from downtown Jackson. The views are spectacular of wildlife. If you want to hike they only get better as you can see from my pictures."
523,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Greenfield, IN ",Elk refuge,It is wonderful that this refuge exists for these magnificent animals. There were hundreds to be seen that day. I would love to do the sleigh ride to see them in the early winter.
524,National_Elk_Refuge,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Indianapolis, IN, ",Beautiful - but no elk in August,"Such a beautiful place with so many birds and a beautiful stream. It was fun watching people fish and the tundra Sean and their baby float around. Sadly, the Elk are much higher up in the hills in the summer."
525,National_Elk_Refuge,Jul 2017 , Family,Lebanon ,wildlife,"We have seen the elk and bison in the winter when they are down in the valley for the winter. There are a thousand or more elk and a small herd of bison. For a fee there are horse pulled sleds/wagons that venture into the refuge for close up viewing. During late spring, summer and early fall the animals leave the valley and move into the mountains. Bison are often seen along the highway toward Kelly WY on the north end of the refuge along the Grosvant River. We have visited in every season and have always spotted wildlife."

527,National_Elk_Refuge,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Fort Myers, FL ",Buffalo Roam Tours,"Not much to see this time of year but tour was very informative. We saw a falcon and antelope. A few other birds. I bet it is amazing with 9,000 elk there in the winter."

May 20,2017. As we were passing thru, not happening when we were there. Must be a terrific site to see thousands of elk there. (Plural of elk is elk!) Great museum next to refuge. Worth a visit to this museum."

But we did see a small group of young badgers, a lot of birds, many prairie dogs, antelope and pronghorn sheep. The drive is relaxing with awe-inspiring views. DO drive up the winding road to Curtis Canyon (yes, please have a four-wheel drive as suggested or you will regret it). It has inspiring views from the top of the mountains and canyon."
539,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Friends,"Brisbane, Australia ",Sleigh ride right up to them!,"What a cool experience this is. I went in January so the elk were very visible. We got all bundled up and climbed into a 20+ person sleigh for my first experience up close to elk. The driver gave out blankets and proceed to enlighten us on all things elk. The wind was pretty strong this day but so worth it. You are led into the open range where they all gather. The driver then stops at several different angles for pictures and questions. We saw elk fighting, lounging and even loving. Would highly recommend this to everyone."
540,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2017 , Family,"Illinois, ",Drive through area,"This is a free refuge at the end of Broadway on the east side of Jackson. It is essentially a drive through series of roads at the foothills of the mountains.    The winter season is the only time of year to observe elk. During the summer months, the elk disappear into the mountains. In June, we were able to see some pronghorn, a wide variety of birds, and dots on the hill that were bighorn sheep.    You do get a phenomenal view of the Grand Tetons!"

I had read a little of the history. The elk migrated south out of the Grand Tetons park in the winter for food. However, when development in Jackson began to encroach, they started starving in large numbers. The citizens and eventually the government stepped in with winter feeding and the Refuge was established.    I had an early morning flight morning flight and happened to catch this picture. While there are no Elk in early June, there were lots of birds. What a beautiful area."

The elk and bison were grazing on the flats of the reserve there must have been 500 out there. Side roads still closed for the winter and as spring summer come animals will move back to higher grounds. Lots of walkers and some bikers on the road. Absolutely worth the drive but not well signed in town which streets to find entrance. Takes about 1 hr if you drive. Some interesting little animals that dig holes and scurry across the road out near the ranch end they are fun to watch. Road suitable for small cars to large RVs without car tows attached.

569,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2017 , Couples,"College Station, TX ","Good place to see Elk, especially in Winter","In late Spring or Summer, the Elk are on the move and more spread out.

570,National_Elk_Refuge,May 2017 , Family,"Orlando, FL ","Bighorn Sheep, Ground Squirrels and Mountain Bluebirds","We missed the elk but we were able to see a large flock of bighorn sheep walking along a rocky ridge not far from the entrance.

Entrance is at one end of Jackson, easily accessible. Only one way in & out, a lot on rough dirt road. Just as we made sharp left (@ a ranch), we saw numerous 'gophers' sunning themselves on the road - they all upped & quickly scurried away as our car approached. We did see male & female Big Horn Sheep on the 2 occasions we visited - looking pretty scruffy, as they were loosing there winter coats. We enjoyed it!"

We did not see any elk, as we understand that they have migrated north to Yellowstone.    However, we did see lots of big horn sheep. Many times grazing on the hills and could actually hear them walking. On one occasion they were on the road licking minerals from the road.    One evening we also observed a herd of pronghorn antelopes in the distance. Having a pair of binoculars helps.    During this period, the Miller was not yet open for tours. Great place to visit!"

We are so glad that we went!!! There are rangers there and they were very helpful! There is great information about the Elk, as well as an observation deck over the refuge. Also, there were great souvenirs available, snacks (locally made high protein bars for long hikes), as well as beautiful jewelry, and all proceeds from sales support the National Elk Refuge! Although we did not end up taking the road advised (driving along the Butte, seen directly from the back of the Visitors Center - a dirt road which leads to an unfenced area, giving unrestricted access to the Elk, Sheep, Pronghorns, etc.; see the attached map - pink areas were closed as of last week but you can walk the dirt road), we saw Elk and Bison on the Main Road going into Grand Teton National Park on a loop going around Mormon Row. The rangers are also streaming the eruptions of Old Faithful on a laptop at the Center, which was great to see given that we were not going to get to see Yellowstone on this trip."

The first day we were there, the elk were way off in the distance, but the second day they were right in front of the Visitor Center - all 8,000 of them. What a special treat it was to see so many of these majestic creatures. The Center itself, is very well done and worth a visit.

Took the trip in late March and snow was almost completely gone, so a wagon ride instead of a sleigh ride, but everything else was still the same. Our wagon driver must have been doing the trips for years because he had great stories to share and gave us a lot of history about the elk and the 500 bison that are also on the refuge. Took us right out in the middle of big groups of elks so we were able to get a lot of good photos. Don't miss this experience."

We also saw a coyote, tundra swan, etc. None of these things were pointed out to us, however. Our tour guide used the entire tour to tell us how terrible wolves are that they kill perfectly good elk, when the elk should be living here for hunters. It was extremely disappointing and made the entire experience seem fake and depressing. It's sad that he had that opinion and even more sad that he used his platform to try and push his opinion on so many people."

We went on a super windy and cold day and stayed pretty comfortable with jackets and gloves.... they do provide blankets which would help. But know the weather before you plan to go. Easy to buy tickets at the visitor center and the shuttle made everything super easy. Would recommend to anyone wanting to get out and see local elk and experience the outdoors.
632,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2017 , Couples,"Sammamish, WA ",Thousands of Elk visible from the road,Loved seeing the thousands of Elk from the road each time we drove by.

636,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Couples,"Prior Lake, MN ",Lots of elk,"With the rough winter this year the elk refuge has plenty of elk to see. Roughly 10,000 this year but you won't get to see them all. The sleigh takes you out to a group of them and you get to see them up close. Keep you eyes open for other animals. We saw some eagles as well. We went in the morning around 11am and had a great ride. The elk were all bunched together. Our guide said you don't want to be in the first group at 10 am as there are lots of people waiting to see the elk. And the later it gets the elk get spread out. Definitely worth the trip if you want to get a good look at the elk up close. We went on a Friday when the raptor center brings in some education birds. If you like raptors it's a good opportunity to see both them and the elk on the same day."

641,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Couples,"Redwood Falls, MN ",Nature lover's dream!,"While we stayed in Jackson, we drove through and parked in the refuge 4-5 times. Each time we parked, we would stare at a hillside, and be able to pick out various animals that were grazing. One day, we saw an older couple with a pair of binoculars talking excitedly and pointing, so we rolled the window down to listen to them talking to each other, but instead, heard (and then saw) a small pack of wolves howling at each other for an extended period of time. That was the highlight. The 7,000 elk are also entertaining to watch! Bring binoculars!"
642,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Couples,"Omega, OK ",Must do when in Jackson!,We just returned from Jackson Hole. The sleigh ride was the first thing on our to-do list. The driver was so much fun and very informative. There are thousands of elk in each of 3 herds and the sleigh goes right to the edge of the herd while the elk seem completely undisturbed. We had a very short wait from the time we purchased tickets to the time to board the shuttle and this seemed to be the norm. Great experience!
643,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Couples,Maine ,Up close and personal,Loved seeing the elk up close and it was very information but dress like you are going skiing! And don't sit near the back of the sleigh or you will feel every bump with twice as much intensity.

652,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Family,"San Antonio, Texas, United States ",Dead elk?,"We loved our travel guide, Jud! Full of knowledge about all. I was most surprised to see dead elk decomposing on the property. He did explain it and the whole circle of life, but I would have liked to warn my kids. Plus, I didn't need to pull up right next to a dead one.  Got to see sparring elk and even a coyote on the property."

Our sleigh was pulled by two big grey Percheron horses. Our guide Justin was not only knowledgeable, but so enthusiastic. It was easy to see that he loves this place! The white landscape and the falling snow made the elk even more elegant!"

Mike was our knowledgeable guide, and Jack and Jill did the heavy work of pulling the sled. As previously mentioned, don't waste a photo by taking it too soon, as you get really close and can get some stellar shots. Looking over the herd was like looking at a forest of branches - but the branches are antlers:)"
657,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Friends, ,A Must Do In the Winter,"We feel like we hit the jackpot in having Meredith as our sleigh guide, although I have a hunch that everyone leaves feeling like this was the experience of a lifetime and every guide is similarly passionate and knowledgeable. We got lucky in that the day we visited happened to be a sunny and unusually warm winter day, so many of the male elk were playfully sparring and putting on a visual and audio show (spoiler alert: they sound like cats!).    Photo Tip: If you'd like a good souvenir photo to help remember the experience, don't be bashful about asking someone to take your photo when you're about 10 minutes into the ride and a few meters from the elk. As time went on, we moved further and further away from the elk and felt like we'd missed the opportunity to capture the ideal photo memento of the experience. :)    Bundle up, but know that the blankets they provide are exceptionally warm."

Also, take the ride around on the backside of the refuge to see the bighorn sheep and another view of the elk herd. It's free and nice scenery."
668,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Friends,"Mississauga, Canada ",Unbelievable experience not to be missed!,"You can't visit (ski) Jackson Hole in the winter without taking an afternoon trip to see the National Elk Refuge. It's a short 30 minute public bus ride from the ski hill, and the refuge transforms you in to the wilderness. Where else can one see over 1000 wild elk in one place just hanging out for the long cold winter. The horse-drawn sleigh ride takes visitors nice and close to the elk for perfect picture opps.

If you love wildlife this is the activity for you. Our sleigh driver was very knowledgeable about elk and pointed out the different characteristics of different elk. It was an awesome experience to be surrounded by thousands of elk. I would do it again in a heart beat! Very affordable. They give you blankets and I would suggest having something to cover your face as the wind was gusting when you got out in the middle of the refuge. Reservations is not needed unless you have a group. We only had 4 but it was nice to know we had a place when we showed up."
670,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Solo,"Saco, ME ",Great way to spend an hour or so,"Very interesting, the sled driver is very informative and has the team of horses take the sleigh right among the elk that are not disturbed in the least. Dress warm and take a camera."

An up close encounter with these majestic animals.,"We have visited this area several times during the summer and the reserve was just an empty plain. To visit it in the winter and take a sleigh ride through the herds gathered by the warm water and food was very special. In the sleigh we all had blankets and the guide was able to get us up quite close to the animals. The guide was knowledgeable and answered all of our questions and offered a great experience. At the end, we even got to see a visiting eagle!"
678,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Friends,"Austin, Texas, United States ","Elk, elk, everywhere!",I'm not sure what tour they're talking about on this page that was $100+ because we went to the Visitor's Center in Jackson Hole and for $21 per person you spent about an hour in a sleigh right next to over 1000 elk. I got some fantastic photos and learned a lot about elk. Our guide was very knowledgeable and we enjoyed it very much.    When they tell you to dress warm and in layers they mean it. We did and even so it got very windy just as we were finishing our tour and it was pretty darn cold. They provide blankets but people who didn't dress as we did were really miserable those last 15 minutes. We were fine - just dress warm.    This excursion was included in our tour package and we enjoyed it tremendously.
679,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2017 , Friends,"South Shore, SD ",Just a few elk 😀,"Wonderful fun ! The sleigh ride was a great way to get up close with the magestic icons of Jackson Wyoming.

After waiting for the,Mao safely move we drove to the sleigh ride area. I was half expecting a 20-minute out and back tour so was very supposed and happy to have an extensive tour from very knowledgable guide. We went very close to large herds of elk and stopped for photos and then continued through and around the herd.  Worth every penny."
681,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Couples,California ,Sleigh ride onto the refuge into the midst of hundreds of elk,You get amazingly close to the elk that overwinter here while the driver of the horse drawn sleigh tells you about the elk and the refuge. Dress really warm if its cold out - you will be mostly sitting down for about an hour.
682,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",What a way to experience an animal migration,"Ok, so you may not get to Africa to experience the migration of the Wilderbeast, but if you are Jackson Hole and have an hour or so...go to the Visitors Center and by a ticket for the sleigh that will take you out among the heard of Elk that migrates here in the winter. There are a few heards totaling about 7000 Elks. Great way to learn about this animals. Great for any age."

684,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Family,"Highland Village, TX ",We were cold but the elk handled it beautifully!,"I took a sleigh ride out onto the elk refuge with extended family last week. The tip to dress warm was an understatement so prepare yourself for cold out in the valley. We were at the visitor's center at 9am to purchase tickets for the first sleigh at 10am and we almost didn't get them. Go ahead and reserve your sleigh ride ahead of time if you know when you're going to go. Our guide was fantastic, very informative and friendly. We didn't feel rushed at all and really got to sit and enjoy our views of the mountains and the elk. This is great for families, not the romantic sleigh ride you might have for couples at Spring Creek Ranch (my husband and I did that one alone last year) but for the experience or with a family this is a must-do in Jackson Hole."
685,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Family, ,Great visit,"We signed up for a guided naturalist tour and a sleigh ride. By far, the guided tour by the naturalist was the best. She was extremely knowledgeable about the reserve,ecosystem and wildlife. It was very engaging and we learned a lot about the elk migration.    We also took the sleigh ride which was fun and got us an up close look with the herd. Younger kids would appreciate the sleigh ride more and teenagers would appreciate the naturalist tour..at least my opinion."
686,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Burien, WA, ",Great wildlife,"This was a winter visit. We did not do the sleigh ride--could not cope with the thought of being herded into the box they call a sleigh. But a herd of elk was quite close to the gravel road. We kept going back up that road several times a day and always had wonderful new encounters with Prong, mountain sheep, bald eagles and elk."

688,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2016 , Solo,"Jackson, WY ",Federal History in the American West,"In the early part of the 20th century much of Jackson Hole had been homesteaded by pioneers trying to eke out an existence in a place not ideal for ranching due to the long winters and short cool summers. Typically a hay field would yield a single cutting of hay for the summer, which would have to suffice to feed the ranchers cattle for the entire course of the winter. Into this picture enter the elk, originally a plains and prairie species which had been driven into the mountains by Euro-American settlement in the west, largely brought on by the Homestead Act, which allowed a person to lay claim to varying size plots of land, make several years worth of improvements to it (build fences, home, outbuildings, etc), and eventually gain title to it. The heavy winters in the mountains, and the expansion of human settlement blocking the elks' rapidly shriveling migration routes left the elk herds starving, so they would go for the available feed sources in the rancher's stack yards, where they gathered hay to in the summer. This created a problem for the ranchers and the government, which owned the wildlife. in the early 1900's an organization was formed to protect the remaining herd to try and save and maybe expand it, so the government bought and closed to homesteading nearly 25,000 acres of the valley floor, and created the National Elk Refuge. Many local residents worked at the ""Government Ranch"" growing and putting up hay to feed the herd in the winter, actually, when this author was a young child, the Sleigh Rides packing out loads of tourists to take pictures of elk today, were real hay rides as you could go out with the crews feeding the elk, maybe even get to pitch a little hay yourself. Then the government stopped feeding hay and moved to alfalfa pellets which are more convenient from a management perspective. They could get rid of their hay crews in the summer and most of the feed crews in the winter. Pellets were a problem with the herd however, as the big bulls could push the little calves and cows out of the way and away from the feed, consequently many starved. A conscious effort to reduce the herd from it's original migrating size, estimated at nearly 25,000 animals, to the hay feeding era size of approximately 7500 animals, to current herd size goals of around 4000 animals may be the government answer to reducing starvation from alfalfa pellets. In addition the re-introduction of wolf packs to the general ecosystem has resulted in an increase in winter kills, but a consequent rise in fitness in those animals that do survive.  From a tourist perspective, the creation of the Elk Refuge, as well as the creation of Teton Park in 1929-1950, and the original work, creation of Yellowstone in 1872, has resulted in an area in northwestern Wyoming with relatively low human populations, although these are seeking to expand at almost any cost, in an area of nearly unmatched scenic beauty. The Elk Refuge, and forest to the east of it, wilderness to the north of it, and park to the west of it, is truly a national treasure, albeit one that might be well viewed through the lens of historical perspective."

There were some very cool genetic differences. Some of the Elk were sparring and that was amazing to watch. He was also very knowlegeable about their migration, utilization/history of the refuge, and the eagles nesting on the refuge. The hour flew by.

719,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Middleburg, VA ",No Elk!,"We rented an ATV from a near-by local company and drove around the refuge for a few hours. It was pretty land and we saw a few smaller species of wildlife, but no elk (and we were there in Oct. 2015). Some good views, but I wouldn't spend extra money on the place when you can drive around for free."
720,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Family,"Cincinnati, OH ","Elk, Wolves, Big Horn Sheep licking your car and Moose",This was one of our highlights of our trip and it was free. Worth the drive through Jackson about 1 mile past. Tons of animals and we watched a pack of wolves as they moved about. Awesome.
721,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Central Florida, FL ",Massive magnificent herd,"6000 elk roaming adjacent to downtown. It's an amazing site to behold. However protected they are the herd is annually culled. Very sad. These are stalwart creatures to roam the area looking for food, glancing up to view the human gawker then returning to their grazing. You can pull off the road and observe them or take a wagon ride through the herd!"
722,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Jackson, WY ","Beautiful views, big horn sheep, elk, buffalo, and antelope","How can you rate nature and its beauty less than a 5? The only thing that gets in the way of this attraction is the humans that frequent it BUT you cannot blame them for wanting to see the area. Along the butte you can see the big horn sheep and if you go slow enough as you pass them in your car, they will lick your vehicle free of all its salt. In the winter (right now) you can see buffalo and antelope and plenty of elk. We live out in the development that was grandfathered in so we drive the refuge road daily and get to enjoy the views. We have even seen wolves on the butte. One of the most fascinating things for us is when herds of elk are all around and we park the car and turn of the engine and just listen with the windows down. Incredible to hear the elk talking to each other. We regularly see owls in the evenings and on occasion bald eagles. It is also a great place to go for a run but keep your eyes open since many people are busy looking for animals and have their eyes off the road."
723,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Couples,"Fort Lauderdale, FL ",Great experience,"Although extremely cold, (make sure to dress extra, extra warm if temps are in the negatives) this was a really great experience.

We all enjoyed it very much. The guides and hosts/drivers were friendly and informative. It's a reasonable expense to see something you never get close to in the wild. Although it was 15' outside we dressed warm and we didn't mind. I highly recommend this during a winter visit
728,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",Sleigh ride in refuge highlight of week and only $21!,"This is the best tour deal by far. Only $21 for an hour tour on an open sleigh (blankets provided) drawn by draft horses and lead by an informative, friendly and fun guide. They have a special permit to enter the refuge to provide you with an up close view of the elk. Great for all ages. No one will be bored. It was very cold, -2 degrees, when we went; so, dress warm and be sure to have a scarf to cover your nose and mouth as it can be windy. I usually don't like tipping (employers should pay living wages!), but this is one time I really wanted to and did tip."

There a so many elk, is was a truly amazing experience."
730,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Couples, ,"Fair price, great adventure!","So many elk on the refuge! They migrate down from the mountains around November, so December is a perfect time to see bulls, cows, and calves. Get to see elk and bug horn sheep up close!  Very informative tour guide, and the horses (all of which are well cared for!) are sweet and friendly. This excursion is a must-do for any visitors out this way."
731,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Couples,"The Woodlands, TX ",Interesting and great place for families!,"We took the sleigh ride on the refuge that the Visitor Center offered for a cheaper price than other places and enjoyed getting close to the elk. We also enjoyed taking the free wildlife tour through the Visitor Center, with our guide Julie who showed us a lot of wildlife including the elk. We were able to go behind the scenes and see several bald eagles, coyotes, pronghorn, roughleg hawks, and bighorn sheep. She was very informative and knowledgeable about the elk and all of the animals in the area."

I liked that it started at the Visitor Center, which was very informative and included live animal exhibits. The bus ride to the reserve was quick and comfortable. Once on the sleigh, our awesome and funny guide, got us right up next to so many elk. We even had a bald eagle soar right over head. If it is the winter, dress warm! They have blankets, but it does get cold. The highlight of our trip!"
736,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Solo, ,Up close and personal with Elk (loads of them),We've been on the sleigh ride a few times. It's amazing to be so close to so many large animals. The guides are knowledgeable and entertaining. Dress warmly!

Behind a patient Percheron team named Jack and Jill our sleigh toured withing 10 yards of Bulls and Cow elk. Our driver and guide was extremely well informed, besides a great lecture on elk and the history of the refuge, he patiently answered our questions. Highly recommend this experience to all that love wildlife and those who should."
739,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Family, ,Wonderful!,"It's exciting to see so many beautiful Elk walking, standing and lying around. We visited over Christmas and there were sleigh rides right into the herds. I'm not sure if those are offered all winter or just during the holidays. However, you can drive through the refuge and see for yourself. We saw long-horned sheep that came right up to the vehicle and licked the tires. We assumed it was for the salt. They are usually high in the elevations during summer so this was a treat. Also saw bison and cow moose. We kept looking for the regal bull but they were elusive. Highly recommend this ""free"" adventure."
740,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Couples,"Alabama, ",A must-see!,The National Elk Refuge is a must-see! The history and science behind this extraordinary wonder.

747,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Couples,"Providence, UT ",Amazing Sight,It is definitely worth visiting the elk refuge. We have taken the sleigh ride before. We have also viewed the elk from the visitor center or the road. There are several turn-outs along the road where you can pull over and safely view the herd. Please don't just pull over anywhere along the road.
748,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Solo,"Camarillo, CA ",Most awesome visit,"Today's sleigh ride was when the snow was just starting to come down. It was a great visit. Our guide was incredibly knowledgeable, and didn't let another passenger who knew more than he did rattle him one bit.    The blankets were very welcomed by all in the sleigh. The heated bus which takes you back and forth to the reserve was very comfortable.    We passed by a bald eagle, and it was incredible."
749,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Friends,"Boulder, CO ",up close and personal with mother nature,"We discovered that at the far end of Broadway it dead ends into a back gate for the Elk Refuge and we could drive, walk or bike right in!! So we did,First day we saw hundreds of Elk, Amazing, they were only 100 ft away! 2nd day we wnt back in a blizzard and the Big Horn Sheep had come down to the flats by the road. We had them surround our truck to lick the salt off it. That's right the sheep were right next to us. very enjoyable and humbling."

751,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Family,Fort Lauderdale ,Close up to herd of wild Elks - Vow!!!,"Great place to see wild elks up close - saw them spread across the entire range. We also saw a fox while we were there. Tickets are extremely reasonable and need to be purchased from the visitor center (9:00 am). A bus picks you up and drops you at the elk range. Horse drawn sleigh with an extremely knowledgeable guide helps you to understand the elk migration in winter, The sleigh ride can be a bit jolty and chilly but the warm blanket (provided free) and the sheer joy of being next to the mass of wild elks can overcome the minor inconveniences."

757,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2016 , Family,"Cottonwood Heights, UT ",Wow this place is amazing!,"This was by far my favorite part of our trip to Jackson. We saw thousands of elk, a herd of antelope, and big horn sheep. It is a close drive from downtown and worth the time."
758,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2016 , Couples,England ,An interesting drive,This was our first trip to the Refuge and we enjoyed the peace and quiet of the drive. There was little wildlife at this time of year but I'm sure it would be fun to visit in the winter when the herds are there.
759,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016 , Friends,Europe ,Worth a trip,"There are not many places where you can ride in a sleigh and watch the elk being fed. I've been fortunate enough to do this many times and, whenever we had guests from out of town, we'd bring them here."
760,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2016 , Family,"Reno, NV ",No elk in the Valley,What a bummer... long horn sheep... but no elk... so if you are going now that it's winter time you may be outta luck...we went during thanksgiving while visiting family...
761,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2016 , Family,"Jordan, MN ",Don't waste your time,"I remember the good old days, when there were thousands of elk and hundreds of them were big bulls that used to lay along the highway. Yep, and they started showing up in October. Were were there in late November this year, not a single elk could be seen on the refuge."
762,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2016 , Couples,"Birmingham, AL ",Big horn sheep surprise !!!,"We have come to Jackson for many years ,usually in fall . This time we came the weekend after thanksgiving for a change. And to see some snow. We have been lucky to see snow each day , it helps to see the animals. And the mountains are beautiful with fresh snow .  There are not many elk in refuge yet , but they are coming in slowly. We saw a very nice bull and some younger ones .  But they are not close enough to roads to get good picture on phone .  However, we were advised to take the elk refuge road to maybe see some bighorn sheep . We had never seen them here or knew of them before . We were very fortunate to see a whole herd right next to and in the road . So cool .  In regards to seeing the elk , I didn't realize that hunting season was still going on till we saw one going down the road in back of truck . Then noticed quite a few people sitting around in trucks with orange on .  I was surprised and sad they were hunting in the area ,but I was told by some of the hunters . they have to keep down the herds ,to keep them healthy.  So I would not advise going to Jackson with children especially ,to see the elk in the refuge , until hunting season is over . I failed to check this out .  But there are still plenty of moose and sheep to see . They are not being hunted at the moment ."
763,National_Elk_Refuge,Nov 2016,not available,"Jackson, WY ",Great in Winter when the Animals Are There!,"As a local, I have the joy of seeing this refuge in action. It is amazing to see thousands of elk milling around it. The big horn sheep on the back road are also a lot of fun and there are occasionally a bison or two. Take the sleigh ride from the visitor's center to get up close and personal. The displays in the refuge are also worth the visit. It is a once in a lifetime experience. Just know one thing...the elk winter at the refuge. They are out in the surrounding mountains during the summer season and harder to find. So come to ski and enjoy the amazing wildlife while you are at it! Oh, and I guess I should mention that it is a spectacular place to see the billions of stars any time of year!"

765,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016 , Business,"Tuftonboro, NH ",Nice in winter but you need a big lens,The Elk tend to stay in the middle of the range so you need a big lens to capture them. It is always a beautiful spot!
766,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2015 , Friends,"Sarasota, FL ",A marvelous sight,"to see the large herds of elk grazing in the refuge. they come there in the winter to get out of the really bad temperatures in Yellowstone and Grand Teton. Its a beautiful scene with the Tetons behind you and the smaller mouontains I can't recall the names as a backdrop to the valley. I learned that the valley is actually what is called Jackson Hole as it is the ""hole"" between the two mountain ranges. Not to be confused with the name of the town which is simply Jackson."
767,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Very unique place,"Several 1000 acre refuge for elk and bison. While you can see it from the main road from Jackson to Grand Teton NP, the main entrance is in the north side of Jackson. The elk winter here so you won't see them till late fall but the winter heard list at over 5000. Horse drawn sleigh rides are offered in town on the refuge. We say know elk here but plenty of prong horn antelope. Got through the refuge and take the raid up into the mountains and u get a great view of the ""Hole""."
768,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2016 , Couples, ,Mother Nature's Grace,"Our first trip to the refuge was at 5:30pm in late October. The landscape was breathtaking. Just a half mile past the entrance, we were blessed with a large herd of elk, including babies. Rolling the windows down, we could hear the male as he protected them all, about 20 yards away from the females/young ones.    Two miles further, a doe and last year's fawn lazily walked across the road. REMEMBER the speed limit is a limit. Driving under it, especially in these circumstances, is not illegal. These animals are used to vehicles and therefore do not dash when they see cars!!    After dark, on our way out, the final group of elk was smaller in size. However, my husband and I could not believe what stood before us. I do believe we saw the Great Grand Daddy of all elk in the Tetons. He was so majestic!    This is a must see place - and take your time!"

770,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2016 , Family,Minnesota ,Interesting stop!,A local tour guide brought us into the Elk Refuge even though the elk have not quite yet migrated to the area.

771,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2016 , Friends,"Tupelo, MS ",Majestic views,"One of my favorite places to visit in Jackson! Just outside of town and ringed by mountains, it's a must!"
772,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Hayward, WI ",No Elk but neat anyway,We haven't seen elk here yet but we always stop mid Oct. so it's our own fault. Even if you aren't in Jackson when the elk are down from the mountain you should still stop and check out the exhibits inside the refuge center it is definitely worth the stop.
773,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Andover, MA ",lovely even without elks,"The elks populate the refuge in the winter, however it is a lovely spot to view without them. We went to the Visitor Center at the edge of the refuge early in the morning as well as at sunset to take photographs. The VC has a porch you can go to to get a upper view, there is also a serene boardwalk through the march as well."
774,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Ventura, CA ",Looking for elk,"We have come at different times of year and never get to see elk here at the refuge.

779,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Prairieville, LA ",Vacation to Jackson hole,The elk refuge is an amazing area with incredible natural senerie. We were there In mid October and didn't see any elk in the refuge but saw them in other areas not far from there. I think the elk become more prevelant when the snow gets heavy.

We drove through here one day after spending time in town for lunch and to go to the art festival. We did not see any elk or any wild life at all. When we got back to the house we were staying at the house keeper told us that in summer the Elk seek higher ground and go up into the mountains as there is no snow or harsh weather. In the winter they hang out in the bottom parts. That does make sense! As my son says ""duh Mom!"" Ha. Just an FYI if your visiting during the summer months."
787,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Altrincham, UK ",Lots to see even with no elk,This is a vast area for grazing elk. There were none there when we were (September) but there were other deer and bighorn sheep to see as well as birds a-plenty including a pair of bald eagles with their nest. Note that the fences are not to keep the elk in captivity but primarily to protect them and their grazing.

798,National_Elk_Refuge,Sep 2016 , Couples,"York, PA ",A nice way to passtime,"Taking a drive through the National Elk Refuge was a great way that my wife and I found to pass the time. We arrived in Jackson Hole by plane around noon and our hotel check in wasn't until 4 pm. Although we didn't spend the full 4 hours in the refuge, we did pass some time there and found it very enjoyable.    Take Broadway to the east until it stops and you come to a road that meanders through the refuge. We were surprised at all of the irrigation and sprinkler systems throughout the refuge, but it seems to keep the vegetation healthy into September, and it must be good for the wildlife.    The road is a slow dirt road, but while taking in the sites and a couple of convenient photo ops, you won't be going very fast anyway. We heard that the Big Horn sheep were in season, but did not see any. We did see a lot of pronghorn, mountain bluebirds, and herons."

You get really close. The knowledgeable drivers/guides are very informative and friendly. It is great for couples or the whole family. It can get quite cold however, they provide blankets but dress warmly. Hat and gloves for sure, and your camera.  Purchase tickets and park in town at Visitor's Center. A very unique, fun and unforgettable experience."

The sleigh ride was fun and the crew was great. Surely it was cold, but that's one of the main reason you would come to WY in midst of the winter, isn't it? All in all, a welcoming break from skiing."

The ride through it and the views are great – and we did see some animals, just no elk. While there be sure to visit the historical Miller House – and learn the history behind Mr. Robert Miller – the “Father of the Elk” – the house and the furnishing are interesting to check out. In 1985 he built this house with his bride Grace, this home is comfortable and large and well equipped for a frontier homestead – I believe they said they had 8 bedrooms. Volunteer staff are on duty to talk about the history of the National Elk Refuge and early homesteaders who lived on the land. The volunteers are very friendly and provide a lot of insight for the area and the house. Entrance to the historic home is free of charge."

The Historic Miller House is interested and staffed by enthusiastic, friendly, and knowledgeable docent guides.    Also fun are the many prairie dogs on the property - probably nuisances but cute and delightful to watch (they can be shy for the camera).    The refuge is just on the edge of Jackson Hole and is free, so certainly worth a quick stop!"

We never saw an elk in the refuge; however, we did finally see gorgeous elk on the Moose-Wilson Road outside of Jackson. We also saw huge herds of elk when we drove up to Yellowstone (in the Hayden Valley). I am sure that in the winter this refuge is very interesting, but in June, you won't see much. Spend your time looking for elk elsewhere."

The driver is always an excellent local guide or cowboy and he will take you right into the heart of the elk herd. You will be able to observe the elk up close and personal. I have gone on this ride many times with my students. I never tire of the beauty as nature unfolds many surprises. We have seen eagles, coyotes, and wolves in addition to the hundreds of elk. Dress warm.. they will provide blankets, but it will be cold. Enjoy! It's the experience of a lifetime!"

The first elections for Jackson Hole were held at this home. Believe it or not, it is still used as employee housing. Because of that, we were only allowed access to the ground floor which was SO rich in history. Our tour ( we were the only ones there at the time) was conducted by a most interesting couple. He gave us all the details of the Elk Refuge and how the home came to be. His wife gave us a tour of the interior. Both were passionate about the history of this amazing place. It was so worth the 20 minute ride out of the city. I highly recommend this visit."

The view across green fields with the Tetons as a backdrop is spectacular. It would be a thrill to see 6000-7000 elk there in the winter, but even without their presence, this is worth driving through. Numerous campsites within the refuge too."

You go to the travel bureau, buy your tickets, and then are assigned to one of the refuge shuttles. Not much snow when we were there, so we were taken out on a horse-drawn wagon (when there is enough snow, its a sleigh!). It was cold, people. Even with big wool blankets provided (and it would have been unbearable for me without them), I was grateful the trip only lasted about 45-55 minutes. Now here's the thing: it was totally worth it. The Elk are everywhere around you, doing elk things (from practice fighting for the mating season to vacating the evidence of yesterday's dinner), and the views are vast and magnificent. Our super cool, friendly, funny, knowledgeable guide made sure we knew way more about Elk than we did before we got on the wagon. He was great about stopping so we could get countless pictures, answering every question that occurred to any of our group of 16 people, and covered sensitive subjects like mating with practiced-but-correct terminology in front of the little kids on board. Absolutely worth the trip and the time."

Go East on Broadway Ave. Go past the Central Park, past the Hospital. Turn left at end of road on to the dirt road(another entrance to the Elk Refuge). Going down this road, I took pictures of Big Horn Sheep, Elk, and a Coyote. I was so close to the sheep that I almost could have petted them on the head(don't advise such behavior). Enjoy your trip."
866,National_Elk_Refuge,Oct 2015 , Couples, ,Awesome gravel roads,This is a great place to test drive car and trucks. Plus you get to see the bighorn sheep lick the Idaho cars. Avoid stopping in the middle of the road because you are probably impeding traffic.

We saw many hundreds of these magnificent animals amazingly close up. They're used to the horses and people, but you're not permitted to get out of the sleigh or they supposed would take off immediately. We visited in February on a bitter cold day, made worse by a howling wind, and it was snowing. But our big horse-drawn sleigh was supplied with loads of blankets for everyone to bundle up in, and we did fine. Our driver was delightful and seemed to know everything. At the end, we posed for photos with our beautiful team of horses, gentle giants. I'm so glad we went despite our initial hesitation about the weather. It was a highlight of our week in Jackson Hole."

I have been very happy with most of the tour guides we've had. Some are a lot more enthusiastic than others. Our last one was amazing and even though it was cold and windy outside, we had a blast. We really enjoyed seeing an up close view of the massive heard of elk as well as the few other animals that roamed about. We loved the sleigh ride and thought that horses were magnificent along with their drivers. We had a large enough group that we got a sleigh to ourselves which was wonderful. We had a lot of children with us and each one was busy trying to play the wilderness bingo and paying attention to the tour guide to point things out to them. So, whether it is for families or couples, or just friends, this place gives a bigger sense of Wyoming in just a little over an hour. Highly recommend."

881,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016 , Couples, ,Never saw so many elk in my life,"We signed up for a sleigh ride to the elk refuge, but alas, there was no snow. We ended up with a wagon ride, which was just fine. The guide was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. We enjoyed his comments and guidance. Great thing to do. You get up close to the elk. Close enough to pick out elk by age."
882,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2015,not available,"Walla Walla, WA ","Animals, animals everywhere!",We were looking for all fo the animals you are supposed to see in Yellowstone but as we travelled south out of the park we came across the Elk Refuge.    Here we got all of the animals we felt that we had missed. We saw Elk and Moose and antelope and many small critters. Being just outside Jackson the view is spectacular! This is well worth your time if you are around.
883,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Family,"Louisville, CO ",Really great tour,"Guides are fantastic, really knowledgeable about the elk, horse drawn wagons get you right up to the elk. Takes about an hour total, beware that it's a bumpy ride."
884,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016,not available,"Livermore, ca ",Great 2 Hours!,"Did the sleigh tour and had a spectacular time! It may sound corny but it's really a great 2 hours with a knowledgeable and skilled cowboy. You get up close to the elk without disturbing them (they are very very particular about this). The elk are used to the horses and the wagon. The stats were the most interesting part of the journey and Judd (our cowboy) did a great job at giving us more information about elk in the area than I ever thought I could know! We found it absolutely fascinating, although we are big wildlife people, and I can't wait to bore folks at the next social event I go to!!!!! If you're in the area, shouldn't miss this. $20.00 per person well spent."
885,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Family,"Jackson Hole, WY ",OLD HAND,The driver was very informative. The horses were well broke. The elk were everywhere and the big bulls had already started losing their antlers.

It is very kids friendly.    Our guide was very knowledgeable  and friendly.    After the visit, you can do a self-drive and see wild life on the back road to the refuge. Just drive toward the town hospital, and follow signs. This is really nice."
887,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Family,"Washington DC, DC ",Different ways to see,"We visited the refuge by horse drawn cart for a close-up view of the elk. This was interesting (cold - dress very warmly). What we liked best was the drive on Elk Refuge road - further from the elk, but we saw big horned sheep and swans close up. The views are also spectacular. Liked it enough to visit twice."

893,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",Awesome experience would do it again,"So glad we decided to do this. Price is very reasonable, I think $21 for adult, maybe a little less for kids. The tour takes approximately one hour. You take a quick bus ride from the visitor center in Jackson, to the Elk Refuge. You then load up on a carriage pulled by two draft horse and a guide from Double H Bar Ranch. The horses are in excellent condition, very well cared for, and our guide, Justin, was very knowledgable about the refuge, the elk, he answered every question we had in detail and we learned so much about why the refuge is there. There are blankets on the carriage and they run every 30 minutes all throughout the day. Definitely a memorable experience- would definitely do it again. Remember to tip your guide for a great carriage ride and for sharing all their knowledge about the Elk and refuge."

895,National_Elk_Refuge,Apr 2015 , Couples,"Pittsboro, IN ",This is the place to see Elk!,Yes it is on a wagon or sleigh depending on how much snow it is.... but that does not take away from the experience of being among wild animals. It is fun to see the bull elk spar with each other.
896,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Mobile, AL ",Great wildlife viewing,My wife and I signed up for the elk tour and we had a great time. Our only disappoint was that there was not enough snow to take the tour by sleigh. We ended up taking the tour in a horse drawn wagon .  The tour was very nice and full of facts and information about the elk refuge and the surrounding area.  It's a must.
897,National_Elk_Refuge,Jun 2015 , Couples,Glendale ,"No Elk, but Lots of History","My Sig Other loves this stuff, so I tagged along and ended up loving up. We were told about who lived there and their contributions to the area. The house has a number of antiques, which I found fascinating. It's down a beaten path (dirt road) but worth the trip."
898,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Friends,"Reston, VA ",Drive to see the Bighorn herd,"I have taken the horse drawn tour of the main preserve along Highway 191 to the airport. That is a great way to see the huge herds of Elk grazing and resting before their return north.  This year, however, we also took a drive around the back side of the Refuge to see the Bighorn sheep. We drove on the National Elk Refuge Road from the East side of Jackson. It was around 3 or 4pm and it turned out that there were a dozen or so of the sheep down by the road (no tickets required). At one point we saw a couple of rams slamming together with their horns no more than 50-100 yards from our car.    Jackson always has more to discover, and this was a nice addition."
899,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016 , Couples, ,SO many elk! Amazing!,"My husband and I visited the Elk Refuge in February. We were hoping to do the sled tour into the elk, but most of the snow had melted and the tour was being done in a horse-drawn wagon. We packed into the wagon with perhaps 20-25 people and headed out where the herd was. The guide was very informative and told us there were approx. 3000 elk in the herd. We had to stay on a ""road"" due to muddy conditions, but got very close to the elk anyway. They are such majestic creatures, it was an amazing experience."
900,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Informative and breathtaking!,"Because the snow was quickly leaving the reserve we rode in an open wagon instead of a sled. It was amazing. Our guide was so informative about the elk, the other animals that make their way onto the reserve, and the area all around. He was especially kind to our 9 year old daughter who was the only child on the trip. She had received a BINGO card from the welcome center and he helped point out items to her. We even got to see a bald eagle! This was the first thing we did in Jackson and it was awesome!"
901,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016,not available,"West End, NC ",Amazing,We have wanted to return to the Elk Refuge in winter to see all the elk that had migrated down. We were not disappointed.

902,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Miami, FL ",See wildlife up close,"The guide takes you out into the Valley where the various animals are everywhere, and not afraid of the vehicles used.  Gorgeous horses pull the wagons or sleighs through the immense area in the refuge.  The beauty and informative history is very impressive and memorable. Not tedious or too lengthy. Would gladly do it again."
903,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Business, ,Cool place to check out,If you are in Jackson and the elk are migrating you must see them up close. The guys at the refuge no their stuff and it's a great little tour. They've been doing this for over 100 years and it shows. They live their job and want you to love the elk. Love to take the tour in the winter!!! But end of season was great as well.

910,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016 , Couples,"Inkom, ID ",Fantastic Experience!,"Hubby (age 67) and myself (age 62) spent a weekend in Jackson; we live just a few hours away and have been here many times, but never did the sleigh ride into the refuge. Well worth the money!    +Shuttle bus takes you from the Visitor Center to the Refuge  +Shuttles run on a timely basis and when we returned from our sleigh ride, no waiting!  +Sleighs/wagons will take you right out among the elk herd; the closest we've ever been to so many beautiful animals  +Our wagon driver/guide was very knowledgeable, friendly and open to questions, etc.    Additional comments:    *The sleighs (wagons when snow has melted) are open-air. Dress to be outdoors! The sleighs/wagons do have blankets with which to cover your legs, but be sure to wear a wind-resistant coat/jacket, hat and gloves.    *If you are planning a trip from a distance, be sure to double check before planning this activity; elk are present and rides given only during the period Mid-December to early April.    *Might say this could be much for very young children; outdoors, seated in a wagon/sleigh for nearly an hour. I'd say if a child can't recognize elk in pictures and get excited about seeing large animals, perhaps that child is too young for this experience . . .    Well worth the money and we'll do it again if the opportunity presents itself!"
911,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2016,not available, ,Elk Refuge,Meredith was a great guide. Learned a lot about elk! The horse drawn wagon ride out to the elk was fun and they provided blankets. Great up close views and plenty of opportunities to take my photos.

The operation is nonprofit and is very high quality. The guides are very friendly, knowledgeable and know their business.

917,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016 , Family,"Summerfield, FL ",Sardines on a sled.,"We have been to the Elk Refuge a number of times. It's just what you do when you come to Jackson in the winter. This time was the most unpleasant of our excursions. It happened to be on a Sunday and that may have been the reason for overcrowding. We knew when we bought our tickets that there were lots of visitors. The problem was the way we were expected to sit on the sleigh. There were about 14 of us, some very large people and it was impossible to move. I never was able to sit with my back to the wall. All of my photos are shot between the bodies of those around me. I will have to be very creative as I crop photos in order to salvage any shots at all."

David and his team, Jimmy & Sage, did a great job taking care of us.    David had a great sense of humor and a vast knowledge of not only the elk, but of the Tetons and Yellowstone area. He was very professional and when we asked the same question more than once because some of us weren't paying attention the first time, he answered good naturedly, all over again. He clearly knows the views are distracting! :)    Dress in layers, good boot socks and don't forget your sunglasses and camera!    I would love to go back in the summer on one of the back country trail rides he and the rest of the staff run."

928,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016 , Family,"Monticello, AR ",Must do in Jackson,"We love nature and live on a farm so we wanted to do this but didn't really have any expectations. We LOVED it. It is well worth the $21 admission price per person and the guides are very knowledgable. They explain everything about the elk, certain ones they see year after year and you are able to get very good pictures. The guide also told us about a road that is in the refuge directly behind the elk, where a herd of big horn sheep had been spotted, so we did that afterwards and it did not disappoint as well. The sheep were actually in the middle of the road which made for good photo ops. My 3 year old son loved the elk, horses that pulled the wagon and the sheep. Dress in layers but a sunny day makes it very tolerable."

The other is on the other side of the refuge where you simply drive along the refuge road and see whatever wildlife you might see. We ended up doing the second one every morning and were able to see, depending on the day, mountain sheep, antelope, mule deer, a few bucks, and plenty of elk, albeit farther away than if you were to ride the sleigh. It was a great way to start our day and a great Jackson memory."

You could easily walk to the elk refuge visitor center from town....    Well worth a visit...and hope you get Meredith as a guide!"
960,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016 , Couples,California ,Fun,This was a pretty fun tour. Once we arrived at the refuge we got on a sleigh pulled by two beautiful horses. It was very cold but we were provided blankets. The elk were magnificent! We got pretty close and took amazing photos. We also spotted a few bald eagles. Our guide we very knowledgable and gave us so much information. We had a blast.
961,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016,not available,"Clarksville, IN ",Wonderful family experience!,This is a must see while visiting Jackson Hole in the winter! You are up close and personal with the elk!
962,National_Elk_Refuge,Feb 2016 , Couples,"Wayne, PA ",Eye Opening,This was a highlight on our trip. The sleigh ride is cozy and comfortable and our guide was very informative. I couldn't believe how close we got to the Elk. It was a lot of fun and surreal.
963,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"New Haven, KY ",Elk Refuge was a favorite,"When I visited Jackson Hole and the Tetons a few years ago, I picked up a brochure with information about the winter sleigh rides on the refuge. That brochure was what prompted me to plan a winter trip to the area. We visited the Elk Refuge the 1st full day of our trip and it was a great way to start our vacation. We walked from our hotel to the visitor center and signed up for the 1st sleigh ride of the day. The day was very foggy, which decreased visibility somewhat, but actually made for a neat experience. A shuttle picked us up and drove us a few minutes to the stable area where we loaded the sleds. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and did a great job getting us where we were up close to the elk and get great pictures. He even spotted a bald eagle and stopped so we could get pictures. One of our group commented it was possible the best $20 he had ever spent (I think it was $21, but you get the picture). I would definitely do this again and would recommend to others."
964,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Charleston, SC ",Elk Everywhere!,"This was our second time on the elk refuge, it's always great! This time the sun was shining and no wind! It was amazing as was our guide. The blankets on the ride kept us warm. The sleigh ride is amazing as well. There are elk everywhere. There is one this year that has a huge set of antlers. The guides are very informative and can answer questions concerning the region and the elk."
965,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Cleveland, OK ",Amazing,"If you go to Jackson Hole you HAVE to do this. This was amazing. Short lived, but amazing. I would recommend the 2:00 or 3:00 tour so you can get some amazing photos before the sun starts going down."
966,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Family,"Providence, RI ",If you like animals then do this!,My family took a sleigh ride into the Elk refuge where we saw thousands of elk. It was amazing being able to get so close to these awesome animals. It was kind of expensive but totally worth every bit. Just dress warmly as it is cold out there!
967,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Asheboro, NC ",Worth every penny,The sleigh ride was great. Meredith was our guide and had a lot of information to share. Would recommend this for anyone visiting the area.

969,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Family,"Provo, UT ",Majestic animals in a majestic setting.,"We merely drove around the refuge to show the children the magnificent animals and talk about the Elk, the people who care and provide for them, the racks that are put to good use, etc. Rather a fantastic sight to see hundreds and hundreds of Elk in such a setting.  Educational for the mind and heart."
970,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2015 , Family,"St. Augustine, FL ",Wildlife Viewing at its Best,"During the winter months, it is such a joy to take the sleigh ride into the refuge and see the elk up close and personal. Before and after your ride, there is the opportunity to visit the museum."
971,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Friends,"Port O'Connor, TX ",Sleigh Ride,"Loved every minute of it, very informative and very enjoyable. Guide was very pleasant horses did great. Beautiful elk on the refuge."
972,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Friends,"Edinburgh, UK ",Interesting if not particularly varied,"The Elk Reserve borders Jackson so you can pretty much walk out of town and be assured of a sighting.    However the reserve is large and they may just be dots in the distance    If you walk out of town on the airport road there is a visitor centre where you can purchase touristy gifts and access viewing platforms. You can also book a horse drawn sleigh ride into the reserve.    This allows you to get close to the elk without them being spooked.    Good photo opportunities although I would recommend you sit on the side of the sleigh facing the animals or you'll have to do a lot of twisting.    Last time I visited I got good images of the elk, bald eagles and coyote. Very very rarely there may be a wolf sighting but it would be by far the exception.    Far more chance at Yellowstone via the north entrance for Wolves although you would still be exceptionally lucky.    The visitor centre also provides an educational service for local schools. It's worth a visit if you have down time but don't expect too much from the animals. They come down to the reserve to sit out the winter. They won't be bounding about!!"
973,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Wheatland, WY ",BIGELK!!!!,"This was a great thing to do while visiting Jackson. Well worth the money. Our sleigh driver was so knowledgeable about the elk and history. We got so close to the elk, they didn't even care we were there. They were just laying down, sunning themselves!"
974,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Family,"Raleigh, NC ",Very Charming,"Wear warm clothes, snuggle under the blankets - the little sleigh ride is a fun thing to do! We have never had to worry about making a reservation way in advance, there is usually room whenever you show up and want to go! Seeing the elk up close and listening to your guide/driver is worthwhile!"
975,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Solo,"Glenview, Illinois, United States ",For winter only,A sleigh ride onto the refuge for an hour was great. Got close to the elk. Buy tickets the the visitor center in town. Leaves every 1 hour or so starting at 10am. They have blankets but dress warm as it can get quite cold and windy. This is only for winter time.
976,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016,not available,"Pompano Beach, FL ",A Winter Sleigh Ride Among the Elks,"Loved our wintry sleigh ride amongst the elks who have migrated near Jackson, WY to find food and protection over the winter months. Short walk to the Center from town where you will hop on a bus for a fast trip to the Refuge. Enjoyed hearing many facts and stories about these incredible animals from our guide. You get up and personal with them in your sleigh with personal blanket to keep warm. 7500 Elk antlers are shed on the Refuge each year and the Boy Scouts gather them to donate and sell annually. Great way to spend a day off the slopes. The Visitor Center is well worth some time as well - nice gifts and souvenirs."
977,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Solo,"Sydney, Australia ",Having never seen or heard of elk before this was educational,For a relatively small fee you get taken on a sleigh around the reserve and the guide stops near herds of elk and explains their migrating and growth patterns. A great way to fill a couple of hours and easily accessed from town.
978,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Family,Junction City ,Great experience,"Would recomment to everyone. A must see while in Jacksonhole, WY. There are so many elk on the Refuge."
979,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Nashville, Tennessee ",A Delightful Winter Experience!,"This is definitely a “don’t miss” if you’re visiting the Jackson area. A visit to their website will detail the various activities offered thought the year. We visited in January, so we booked a winter sleigh ride—available December through March (weather permitting). Rides are on a first-come, first-served basis; although you can reserve rides by phone. They offer the option of joining a group tour or booking a private tour; although reservations are requested for the private tour. The sleighs are quite large, so even on a group tour, you will have ample room to move about — when the sleigh has stopped. They encourage you to remain seated while the horses are in motion. You’ll understand why….it can be a little bumpy.    We arrived at the Greater Jackson Visitor Center 30 minutes early for our scheduled tour. The staff was ready and waiting. There is a quick shuttle ride to the Refuge before you board a large, horse-drawn sleigh…..think large cart with bench seating on either side. They also provide numerous heavy blankets to keep you warm. Our guide for the one hour trip was Jason, a very personable young man who enthusiastically shared his knowledge of the elk and the Refuge. We saw many elk from a close distance. Jason would stop the sleigh, and the elk just calmly cross in front as if we weren’t there. If you enjoy photography, you will not have a better opportunity to photograph a huge bull elk! In addition to the elk, we saw four coyotes who were primarily interested in catching mice. If you’ve never watched a coyote “mousing” in the snow, you’re in for a treat. We also saw ducks, trumpeter swans, and even a bald eagle.    This was a great way to spend the morning, and we enjoyed learning about the elk and the National Elk Refuge. It was a special treat to experience the Refuge during the winter. We would definitely book another ride if we should return to Jackson in the winter."
980,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Family,"Flowery Branch, GA ",Really great experience,"I really could careless about seeing the elk, but we went because the men & my 5 year old niece wanted to see them. The guide was very imformative and interesting to hear everything about the elk. For me it is a one time thing, but definitely recommend to do at least once. Very cool to see and do."
981,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016,not available,"Stone Mountain, United States ",Awesome up close elk experience,"Our family went on the sleigh ride on the Elk Preserve. It was great beyond expectations! Richard, our driver/guide was so knowledgeable and personable. We learned so much and were able to get up close to some beautiful elk! I would highly recommend doing this. Also be sure to check out the visitors center. They are a great resource for things to do and see in Jackson and have some great displays about the elk and other wildlife. Be sure to get directions to the backside of the preserve to see the bighorn sheep."
982,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Family,"Gilbert, AZ ",Learned A Lot,What an educational experience! The guides were a wealth of information and very personable answering questions. Sledding through the herd is something you would never be able to experience outside of the refuge. Truly a gift.
983,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Friends,"Casper, WY ",What an amazing place !!,You owe it to yours]self and your family to go out on the refuge in the winter. Its truly an amazing trip that you will never forget. To get that close to these majestic animals is beyond description. Bundle up and go you will not regret it.
984,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Hartland, VT ",A remarkable experiencer,"From a distance this experience, sitting in a horse drawn sled with a bunch of other people, didn't look like the sort of activity I would want to do, but once involved I loved it and found it fascinating. Vast numbers of elk come to the reserve for the winter feeding. During winter the animals are not mating and live peacefully with each other self separated by gender. The males, with their magnificent racks, allow the horse drawn sleds to circulate close to them and thereby allow the human visitors to get undisturbed close up views of the them. The females with their young are a little more skittish, but still remain calm and within view. The sled was driven by a well informed man who took considerable care to present a non judgemental dialogue ~ wildlife management can be a contentious subject. This activity can be enjoyed by all family members. The wonderful images will enjoyably remain with you for a long time. While doing this plan to spend some time in the very good visitors center nearby."
985,National_Elk_Refuge,Mar 2015 , Couples,"Loganville, GA ",Breathtaking experience,Nature at it's finest! This was just a wonderful and priceless experience!! The only thing I regret is our kids weren't with us.

991,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2015 , Family,"Fisherville, KY ",Elk Elk Elk,They are everywhere. We went in the afternoon. Some of the elk were sparing and you could hear the clacking of their antlers. We were taken out to the refuge on a big red sled pulled by two huge horses in the snow. We were given blankets to cover up. The driver of the sled was very knowledgeable about the elk. The kids loved it and so did I. A must see if you are in the area.
992,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Informative tour,We took a sleigh ride through the elk refuge.

997,National_Elk_Refuge,Dec 2015 , Family,"Winter Haven, FL ",TRIP TO THE REFUGE,"Situated within walking distance from the town square, a trip to the elk refuge is a must do. Tickets are bought at the visitor center which hosts a mini museum, gift shop and observation deck. The transport van picks up groups then takes them to the refuge. Be prepared for the cold as you are in an open sleigh on the open field, temperatures can feel alot colder. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, a little history about early settlers, how the refuge came to be and of course the elk. Must do visit."
998,National_Elk_Refuge,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Corsicana, Texas, Usa ",Awesome,We didn't take a tour just drove down the road and pulled into the turnoff a designated to see the wildlife. It was amazing to see that many elk in one place. We saw the sleigh rides going up right next to them. They had about 20 people on each sleigh. Just FYI you do t have to have a tour to see them .. Just drive down the road
