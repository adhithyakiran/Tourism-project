0,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Granby, CT ",It’s a classic,"As faithful as it’s name - if you can, watch from different viewpoints. Loved the deck at the inn with lunch or a cocktail, from the top of observation point and from the geyser basin trail."
1,Old_Faithful,Oct 2021 , Couples,"Florham Park, NJ ",One of the best national parks - don’t miss it,"Stayed 5 days inside the park. 4 days would be ok, 3 days maybe to little. Of course saw old faithful, can’t miss. During covid, finding a table to sit at and eat was difficult. Mornings were cold, no snow yet. Plenty of gysers. No traffic jams during this time. Stayed in the cabin, unfortunately no room in the main bldg. we drove ourselves around wo issue. We did take the 1937 touring car tour which is a must do. Let someone else drive and talk to give a different perspective. Fabulous national park, don’t miss it. We did buy 1 can of bear spray and didn’t use it."
2,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021 , Couples,"Seattle, WA ",Parking can be a nightmare,"Let me tell you, if you are visiting in the summer during nice weather...parking at old faithful with be terrible. We visited on a Thursday, in August and circled the lot for about 25 minutes to grab a spot. People started creating their own spots on gravel by the time we left. A park ranger did tell us that we picked one of the BUSIEST 3 day stretches during this summer... but they aren't sure why. Anyways, LUCKILY by the time we walked up to old faithful it blew 3 minutes later. Talk about perfect timing. Pack your patience, that's for sure. They are actually pretty spot on with predicting the times that it will blow. It's usually every 40-126 minutes. We saw it blow twice by pure coincidence. After watching it the first time we walked around the geysers that surround old faithful and concluded that walk right as it blew for a second time. Definitely plan to walk behind old faithful and down a cement path, over the river and onto the wooden docks that lead you to the other geysers. Follow the crowds of people and they will lead you straight to them. Behind old faithful were some great geysers!! Do not miss those.    There is a cafeteria next to old faithful although we chose not to eat there. It seemed to be nothing special. Of course there is a gift shop there and restrooms.    Plan to spend 2.5 or so hours there (depending on when it blows) to ensure time to walk around the other geysers that surround old faithful. If you are in Yellowstone, old faithful is a must see."
3,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,Colorado ,Breathtaking and Worth it!,"It was more than I expected! We were there at 5am, pretty cold, but yet there were already people there. We watched it go off three times over the course of the morning/day from different vantage points. First, right there in the ""usual spot,"" second we climbed up to watch it from above...that was so neat!.....and third, was watching it from behind as we walked the loop around Old Faithful to see all of the other geysers in the area! This is definitely worth it...though I can't imagine watching this with hundreds of people. The most that were there when we went was around 100."
4,Old_Faithful,Oct 2021,not available,"Sandy Springs, GA ",Old faithful,Go early so you can find a seat so you don’t have to stand. When I was there I took a  awesome slow mo video of old faithful erupting.
5,Old_Faithful,Oct 2021,not available,Illinois ,Fantastic!,"Loved seeing Old Faithful spew! We were very lucky. Arrived, parked in front of the visitor center, used the facilities, arrived at the geyser, watched it spew (within 5 minutes), and were on our way to the next sight in less than 30 minutes! We couldn't have planned it any better."
6,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,"Argyle, TX, ",Awesome Geyser,I would have waited any length of time to see Old Faithful erupt - it turned out to be over 90 minutes. If you just miss an eruption I suggest you get lunch or a snack while waiting. There is seating surrounding the geyser. A look at the visitor center is another option. The wait was well worth it as the park's most famous geyser finally blew.
7,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021 , Family,"Elk Grove, CA ",Give yourself lots of time,"When we went to see Old Faithful we got there early in the morning, but missed the eruption by 5min, so we had to wait 90min for the next one. It wasn’t terrible as there is plenty to see and do in this area, but I would definitely recommend checking the app for the eruption times. I was bummed out about how far the seating was from the geyser. You can get so close to so much in Yellowstone that it was a little bit of a bummer how far back we were. Also give yourself lots of time in this area to explore the other sights, shops, and Old Faithful Inn."
8,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Kalamazoo, MI ",Worth waiting for!,"Definitely a bucket list item! Need patience to wait however!!! They post times but they are approximate. So many people had waited 30 -40 min and gave up and left and immediately after is when it blew! Don't be one that misses out! So many pictures as not sure ""when"" it will really blow, is it now? nope! lol. But definitely something to see, just be patient! You will know when it is done! Beautiful park and so much to see! If you don't have a chair to sit while waiting there are plenty of logs to sit on."
9,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021 , Couples,"Batesville, AR ",Old Faithful,Loved walking on the trail and seeing the scenery. It's so much prettier in person. I would recommend this park to everyone.
10,Old_Faithful,Oct 2021 , Friends,"San Antonio, TX ",Once is enough,I love that they post eruption times so you can enjoy other activities until close to the main event. Seating was available and it erupted almost at the predicted time. It was great to see but once is enough for me.
11,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,"Phoenix, AZ, ",On Time,If you only are going to see one geyser and don't want to wait around for others then this is the one to see. It is a large geyser but not the best in my opinion. Grand is better in its performance.
12,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,"Fenton, MI ",Old Faithful,"Bucket list item for sure, we got there early in the morning which I highly recommend. There was a large line going to Old Faithful in the early afternoon."
13,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,"Moncks Corner, SC ",Must-see,"I was a little cynical about this at first, thinking it wouldn't be anything that wow-worthy, but I was totally wrong!! It was awe-inspiring to see and a must-see. Quick word of advice, when it's over, hustle to the gift shop before the restroom line gets too long (ladies know what I'm talking about!) . The gist shop staff were very nice and helpful. We did not eat in the café but instead grabbed some items from the grocery store side to take in the car as we had a long day of riding through YNP to see the sites."
14,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Jacksonville, FL ",Historical Landmark!,The Old Faithful Geyser is something I’ve heard about all my life so finally getting to see it was a thrill! The park service has a board near the geyser with eruption times listed. We had time to visit the gift shop and get a beer from the restaurant before it blew. The crowds are spread out so it was easy to view. There are places to sit up close but we were further back and still could see it fine. They have a good size village there with lots of shopping and eating available.
15,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,"Palm Desert, CA ",Loved it!,Our tour driver arrived just in time to see Old Faithful erupt. It was a sight to see. I recommend also seeing the Old Faithful Inn.
16,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,"Mount Laurel, NJ ",A Must Do for Your Bucket List,"The geyser goes off every 90 minutes or so, but the times for estimated activity are posted. People will tightly congregate for the last 20 minutes before it goes off. If you are a small person, squeeze through the crowd and sit down. The area is very commercialized and full of Inns and Services. Lots of parking."
17,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021 , Solo,"Tallahassee, FL, ",The Fantastic Classic,"I visited Old Faithful Geyser at the Upper Geyser Basin. I arrived at 9:30 am during September and had no problem getting a parking spot. It turned out as I walked up that I was within 5 min of the next eruption. The accuracy of the estimates is amazing for something with as many variables as a geyser. While not the tallest or longest erupting, Old Faithful has that majestic beauty that makes you fall in love with it right away!"
18,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,USA ,"Took A Little While, But Worth The Wait","We arrived just after the geyser had done its thing. So we waited about 50 minutes and Old Faithful did her thing again, and not disappointing. There is a restaurant, ice cream parlor, bathrooms and plenty to do to kill time while waiting for this important stop in Yellowstone"
19,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,Massachusetts ,Somewhat Underwhelming,"To think Old Faithful is the reason lots of people visit Yellowstone. Yes it was cool to see but honestly wasn't as impressive as I imagined. Obviously the geyser eruption is different at any time and you cannot predict if it will be very high or not. Something to see but people who wait hours and hours for it to erupt seems crazy to me.    And it is very crowded, I think it would have been more enjoyable to sit there and soak it all in quietly with no chattering around me. All you can hear are people talking, kids yelling and running around. Become too touristy if you ask me."
20,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,"Huntington Beach, California, United States ",A ilttle underwhelming,After hearing about the Old Faithful Geyser for so many years we finally arrived at the park in time for its eruption . I will say it was not quite the spectacular event as advertised. Maybe it was an off day. A walk around the mud pits and observing other geyser activity made up for the day. I will say the park was not that crowded this day as we had seen on the news prior during the summer. A tour of the Lodge is a must.
21,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021 , Friends,"McKinney, TX, ",A must do!,"Well, it’s only the most recognizable feature of Yellowstone National Park, right?!?! And it did not disappoint! The park rangers are able to predict within a 20-minute range when an eruption will occur so the crowds start gathering up to an hour beforehand. Those predictions are posted all over the old faithful complex so it’s easy to pick a good time to go.    We were accompanied by a Buffalo who was grazing in the field OF stands in and the park ranger had to move us for a few minutes when he got to close (maybe 8 feet from where we had been sitting!) while he was grazing. But we were able to return before the eruption.    It’s a glorious thing to see and know where and why it happens. You don’t have to see it more than once. But you should definitely see it once."
22,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Fort Worth, TX ",Fun Attraction,You have to see Old Faithful during your time in Yellowstone. The geyser puts on quite a show that is a popular attraction for sure.
23,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021,not available,"Elmira, OR ",Amazing! Kind of says it all.,Take the hike/walk around the board walks. So worth doing. Somehow we timed it to see several geysers go off. The views are incredible and all I can say is it's a must do and well worth your time. I took hundreds of photos that day.
24,Old_Faithful,Sep 2021 , Couples,"The Villages, FL, ",Nature at Best,"Long wait, for a 4.5 minutes show. It is good to see the force of nature. Call ahead for itinerary for the next show. At that time, give yourself +/- 15 minutes."
25,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Virginia Beach, VA, ",Spectacular!,Old Faithful is the iconic stop in Yellowstone. Everyone has to see it erupt at least once. We saw it then hung around the Old Faithful Village and waited for it to erupt once again. It is pretty spectacular!
26,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Noblesville, IN ",Stayed Nearby,"I liked walking the two main loops around old faithful. It was neat seeing all the other geysers, mud pots, blue holes, and other underground activities. In the morning there was mist rising in lots of places all over the valley. There were guides all around on the paths to answer your questions. Old faithful erupts around every 91 minutes. It gets really crowded around 11 to 4. We usually watched early morning and evening. You can go into the Old Faithful Lodge for food or beverage and bring out to enjoy while you watch."
27,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Maumee, OH ",You Have to Go!,"How can you go to Yellowstone and not go to Old Faithful? You have to go! We were fortunate as we stayed at the Inn and our room overlooked the geyser. We saw it erupt 7-8 times. It gets crowded around Old Faithful so come early if you want a seat. Another great way to watch it is by having a cocktail at the Inn's deck. Also, you can hike up to an overlook where you can watch everything down below. This provides a great view of everything in the area including Old Faithful."
28,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Los Angeles, CA ",Overrated,I was underwhelmed by Old Faithful's show. Maybe I caught an off performance and perhaps I lack the nostalgia of many families who visit Old Faithful. At least I only had to wait a few minutes for the eruption.    Don't forget there are plenty of other reliable geysers in Yellowstone (just check the NPS Yellowstone app).    Grand Prismatic viewed from the overlook is a 10x better experience and should be on everyone's bucket list!
29,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available, ,Spectacular,"My son guided me to the back, and he was right...unobstructed view without the drifting spray. Old Faithful was only 3 minutes late!"
30,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021 , Couples,"Whitefish, MT, ",Nature at its finest,Old Faithful never gets old to watch when it erupts. Thousands of visitors annually visit this natural spectacle that is delightful to witness in person.
31,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Rochester, MN, ",iconic,"clock work isnt as good as it used to be, but its close and a must see for sure; hard to say you've visited the park without seeing it"
32,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Austin, TX ",Beauty,Wow! This was wonderful to watch! Old Faithful and her friends are a must to see at Yellowstone.    Few thoughts to make your experience even better:  Wear sunscreen and reapply and reapply.  Realize that there are tons of other people watching as well.  Estimated schedule are on placards at front and back of Visitors Center.    Another visitor to the park recommended getting drinks and watch Old Faithful at sunset.
33,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021 , Family, ,Not to be missed,"Awesome to see this geyser. We were able to get a good view of it since we read the predicted schedule in front of the visitor’s center. We are hikers but we knew we had to see this and it was worth dealing with the crowd of people. Right after we grabbed some baked goods at the Bear Paw Deli inside Old Faithful Inn. We sat inside the Inn and took in the historical feeling. It’s amazing I’m the lobby. Then we sat outside and enjoyed the views of the geyser basin before walking the boardwalks. I loved this experience and we went at mid day when it was very busy. Old Faithful is very special. Don’t miss it. We got to see it twice while we were there for about 2.5 hours. Plus seeing OFInn - loved it. It’s also a great place to bring your lunch and eat on a bench near the Inn’s entrance. The area also has a gas station, gift shops, and my favorite - Bear Paw Deli."
34,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021,not available,"Columbia, MD, ",Must Do in Yellowstone,"My husband and I saw Old Faithful while in Yellowstone National Park. It goes off about every 1.5 hours - the prediction times are listed on the internet and visitor center. Due to earthquakes, the eruption time is predictable. It was very crowded and few had masks on. It is directly behind the crowded visitor center parking lot. Once it goes off, it's neat to watch. It shoots thousands of gallons of hot water over 100 feet. Even though it's crowded, make this apart of your stop in Yellowstone - it's the must do for everyone."
35,Old_Faithful,Aug 2021 , Family,"New Providence, NJ ",Must do!,"Beautiful area!! There is a store, restaurant and bathrooms and of course the great geyser! So very cool to see. Good walking path too!"
36,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021,not available,"Cincinnati, OH ",Got to do it - and you will be glad you did,"While it may seem trite and overdone, you have to do it. Seems like it goes off every 80 minutes or so...while there make sure to walk around surrounding area, as well as stop in the Inn"
37,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021,not available,"Boston, MA ",Try to get to the Overlook,"Very fun visiting and viewing Old Faithful, but the main area gets extremely crowded. I recommend hiking up to the Overlook, it's such a unique vantage point. However, be forewarned that it's a pretty challenging hike up; if you have any difficulty walking/hiking steep trails then skip."
38,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Geysers are still amazing even after 20 plus sightings,"Wildland Trekking Yellowstone National Park July 2021    Hiking with a guide…an amazing great way to make your trip sparkle!    July 2021 our trip began in Chicago, on the way to Yellowstone we enjoyed Wisconsin Dells, La Crosse -Shrine of Our Lady Guadalupe, Sioux Falls, SD - Falls Park is very nice. Badlands National Park -wow! Black Hills National Forest – Custer State Park and Mt Rushmore. Cody, Wyoming – Buffalo Bill Center of the West (museum-awesome!)  discover Cody-it is a must see. We spent 2 days there. See the Dan Miller Cowboy Music revue…17 years and running.  Driving from Cody to Yellowstone is beautiful. Upon entering the park, we drove to the Old Faithful Inn and met at the Visitors Center for our Day 1 with Wildland Trekking hikes. The Geyser area was our first hike. The second part of the hike was Mystic Falls and the rim above. The day’s mileage was 9.2 miles and could easily be 2 days of hikes. We are in great condition and loved the challenge of pushing to 9 miles hiking.  Jennifer our Wildland Trekking guide was awesome. She really knew the park, history and answered all of our “why” and “how” questions. She is a really nice person and the lunch provided was very tasty!  Day 2 was a different amazing at 8500 feet elevation on Bunsen Peak with magnificent mountain views. We me out next Wildland Trekking guide Adriana at the bottom of the peak. This was a rise of only 1200 feet however it is strenuous and a good work out. Literally walking up switchbacks of volcanic rock that moves under your every step on the edge of the Peak. Exciting -Yes ! Once on top, we had another good lunch provided by our guide. Adriana was very nice and knew thew highlights to talk to us about. She even found wild raspberries to eat at on the hike.  The Day 3 hike was even more spectacular in viewing the Yellowstone treasure. We hiked the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone Park. Adriana was our guide again and we had another 6.5 miles added to our total on this day. We began on the edge of the Canyon walking the trail all the way, then looped through a field looking for buffalo. Through more geysers, bubbling mud pots, bubbling pools and general “regular ole” Yellowstone sights. A great day. We had such an amazing time!!    Jennifer and Adriana were so knowledgeable and made all of our experiences something that we will never forget! We feel so lucky to have had this experience.  My niece also had an amazing time and has a new love for the outdoors, hiking, and national parks. The hikes in this order day 1 to 3 and lunches were amazing.    Thank you Wildland Trekking so much for everything!!  We will definitely be hiking with you again!    Forever grateful, The Obermeyer’s"
39,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021,not available,What Cheer ,Awesome,I hadn't been since 1966 and I was not disappointed. We got there about 15 minutes before the eruption and it was gorgeous. Some things never change and make you want to go back more.
40,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021 , Couples,"Bloomington, MN, ",It was on your 2nd bucket list?,"For a lot of us, Old Faithful USA childhood memory from when our parents brought us here or just something we always wanted to do. There are some iconic places in the world which are notoriously underwhelming: The Leaning Tower of Pisa, Stonehenge, Niagara Falls and unfortunately Mount Rushmore (which I disagree with, but it is much smaller than the pictures). So, I would say Old Faithful itself is close to being in that category and here’s why; you have to expend so much time and fortune to get there. It’s really important not to make it a focus of a long trip (which, by definition, Yellowstone is a long trip). One of the roads coming at Old Faithful from the NorthEast is closed for construction making a jam in the western edge of the park of cars and campers. We arrived at the park about 3:00 pm after driving over Beartooth Pass from the NorthEast Entrance. Our plan was to drive in, head south, and circle the entire park including Old Faithful and be gone through the West Entrance around sunset after the crowds had died down. We failed because the one road was closed forcing us into the main stream of traffic on the west side which took hours to get down to Old Faithful. So, we arrived at the giant parking lot and weren’t quite sure where to park in the vast empty expanse so we just followed everybody and we arrived at the venue. In the interest of full disclosure, we are not big on crowds on vacation. So, we hung back on the logs in the dirt. You can see it just fine from anywhere, we just happened to be there when it was not very crowded. We didn’t go up on the boardwalk because we had our dog (which are prohibited up close). Here is the tip of the day: grab your lawn chair! The lawn chairs are also awesome in the rest of the park because the terrain does not lend itself well to sitting. We had a bathroom emergency and went into the bathroom and they were clogged with paper towels and disgusting. We needed food and we each got a sandwich from the cafeteria line; they appeared to have been made days ago like when you forget a piece of cheese on the counter. It is VERY difficult to find food within the park, pack your own food in. Back to Old Faithful; it would be our last stop in the park after spending a day swimming in the river on the west side were the other hot springs feed into the river. We saw many families enjoying it and it looked great. There are a lot of things I would see in the west before I would do the crowds and the cars at Old Faithful."
41,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021,not available,"Denver, CO ",Wow,Plenty of parking but I would still get their early. It goes off regularly so definitely worth waiting. Plenty of other geysers to see in the greater area. There is one other geyser in the area that is constantly erupting.
42,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Wow,"Obviously the most famous attraction in the park. It goes off about every 90 minutes, so if you walk around the Upper Geyser Basin, which is the area behind Old Faithful, you will eventually see it erupt. A lot of people just sit there and wait, which is a waste of time; explore the basin while you are waiting instead. They have plenty of parking and lots of seating directly around the geyser. When it does erupt, it is spectacular."
43,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021 , Family,"Sandown, NH, ",Feel the Mist,"We stayed at the Old Faithful Inn, so we saw her blow many times. Go at sunrise but dress warm. Also go down wind to feel the mist from the spray."
44,Old_Faithful,May 2021 , Couples,"Mooresville, NC ",Take a seat for the show,We stayed at the Lodges. Clocks are available as well as the park app to let you know when she will erupt. There are seats around Old Faithful so you can take a seat and enjoy the eruption. Later in the evening the crowds were much smaller. Enjoy!
45,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021,not available,"Arlington, VA, ",Old Faithful,"The big draw for the Yellowstone National Park is Old Faithful. We went to the 442 pm performance on the day we were there. The venue is, over all, a large area with a number of facilities. Of course, for a draw like this, there is never enough parking. I might suggest that a visitor try to time their arrival just after Old Faithful does her thing and grab a parking spot as people leave the event. The other thing is, just take the first spot available. It’s all in walking distance. There was good 90 second show then go, and it’s just like the photos and right on time. Limited seating in front of the geyser. There is a raised walkway around the geyser. Good (indoor) bathrooms and a number of eating facilities and gift shoppes are available. There is a new overpass being constructed for improved access to this venue."
46,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021,not available,"Concord, NC ",Worth seeing but not the best. . .,"This was interesting to see but by far not the best thing to see in the park. If they post the times we couldn’t find it. There is plenty of room to sit & wait for it. The cafeteria here was horrible. The food is pre made but the lines were still ridiculous. They were apparently out of hot dogs but told us it would be just a min, then 5, then 10, then we heard a guy go to the end of the line & tell people they were out of a lot of things & hot dogs were one thing he said. So that is how I found out after my child and I had been waiting over half an hour total. If you go see old faithful don’t eat there!!!"
47,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021 , Family,"Apple Valley, CA, ",Good Old Faithful,Very nice experience to see old faithful. You might need to wait an hour or so to see it but it’s work it when it does go off. A lot of people waiting here for the perfect picture or video. Recommend this to anyone visiting Yellowstone.
48,Old_Faithful,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Bristol, UK ",Not worth a detour,Tired. Old Faithful might have been spectacular once but it’s very average now. Crowds waited at the rail like celebrity watchers at a film premier
49,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021,not available,Michigan ,Old Faithful,"Overrated in my opinion, but it's worth seeing once if you're in Yellowstone and can find parking. It's more fun in my opinion to explore the area around Old Faithful with all of the other geysers and pools. They do have a sign to let people know when they expect it to go off next, but it's just a prediction and sometimes is off by 20 minute or so outside of the window of time they give."
50,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021 , Family,"Denison, TX ",Amazing!!,"Old faithful erupts about every hour & half. We got there as it had just went off, so we walked around the area seeing more geysers & natural springs. The area is very pretty!!"
51,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021 , Couples, ,Breathtaking Nature!,"Exquisite Nature! Trip of a lifetime! There are places to stay right next to the geyser if you want to make it a longer vacation. We saw a mommy moose and her two babies on our way out of the park.  Be sure you download the app before you visit. Peruse the app and spend some time planning.  There are dozens of benches around Old Faithful you can sit on to see the eruption, be sure to get there early if you need to sit.  You have hundreds of trail options to explore and while driving their the park you can stop and take photos at the hundreds of pull outs/pull overs.  Spend the day and have fun!"
52,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",Old Faithful,"You can check online to see when the next predicted eruption will be. This helped us plan what time to get to the park.    When you arrive, there is a big parking lot to accommodate the crowds. Old Faithful is a very short walk from the parking lot. Arrive ~30 mins early to get a seat on the benches in front.    The visitors center has predictions for all of the geysers and a map to show all of the stops along the way. We walked the 2.8 mile loop around and enjoyed seeing the other geysers and hot springs. It’s an easy walk (paved pathways and boardwalks throughout) with a few spots to stop and sit down along the way as needed."
53,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021,not available,"Cleveland, OH ","Nice, not spectacular","It was good to see. I was happy it went off as we walked up because I do not think it is worth the wait. I think you should see it, but do not schedule a day around it. I would have cut down the time spent here if I did it again."
54,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021 , Family,"Las Vegas, Nevada, USA ",I'm forever yours . . . Faithfully... Amazing Old Faithful,"This is a well developed area of Yellowstone and parking areas can somehow accommodate parking for the peak crowds. It's a joy to see the famous geyser shoot up for more than a hundred feet. The outside areas behind the geyser are also a delight to stroll. The Old Faithful Inn is simply spectacular from its famous grand lobby, good feel benches outside, have ice cream at Bear Paw Deli, shop at its nice gift shop and much more. Ir's simply feels good to be here."
55,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021,not available,"Honolulu, HI, ",There she blows!,We arrived just in time to see Old Faithful erupt. benches are available for viewing but you need to get their early to get a seat. Parking lot was busy at 2 pm so plan accordingly if you arrive earlier in the day. We saw our 1st bison hanging around the geyer.
56,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021,not available,"Burnsville, MN ",One-Time Experience,"Old Faithful was fun for a one-time visit. We luckily arrived within 20 minutes of it's estimated next eruption. I would say my son and I were more excited during our anticipation. Everyone sees photos of Old Faithful, and the photos do the experience justice (without the sulfuric smell). It's a great to see and share with loved ones, however we don't plan to return as we felt that we have seen everything Old Faithful has to offer."
57,Old_Faithful,Jul 2021,not available,"Porto Alegre, RS ",Old Faithful,"The geyser itself is exceptional, but don't miss out on all the other geysers all around the site. There is a shortage of bathrooms and the crowds can get overwhelming."
58,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021 , Friends,"Houston, TX ",Very pleasant walk Bison blocked my path,"We arrived around 8:45am and were able to easily find parking. We discovered the estimated time when Old Faithful would errupt, had plenty of time to find a spot from which to observe. If I'm honest it was all a bit underwhelming. We set out to view the surrounding area and were pleasantly surprised by the other features of the area including the Grotto and the Morning Glory pond. On our way back we decided to climb to the overlook to see the Old Faithful from above, but were blocked by a couple of Bison... all in all it was fun and interesting."
59,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021,not available,New Mexico ,Great experience,"A great experience, if you have the time or cannot do all the hiking associated with other attractions. The time between seems to be lengthening, particularly with the drought experienced as of late. Also, it is not as big of an eruption as in the past for the same reason - still a worthwhile experience. Remember that any entrance into the park takes time to get to any of the attractions - unless of course, if you are staying at the lodging associated with the attraction. If you go, see the lodge and surrounding areas as well, not just the geyser itself"
60,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021,not available,"Birch Run, MI, ",Nice show,We enjoyed watching Old Faithful erupt 3 times while we were staying at the OF cabins nearby. It's quite a show & you have it pretty much to yourselves during the off hours when everyone goes back to their hotels for the night. We really enjoyed the sunset eruption. The only drawback is that it is a very congested area so be prepared to deal with crowds of people.
61,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021 , Family,"Pearland, TX ",A big pain that you gotta do,Too many people in June 2021 and cars everywhere. Hard to find parking and difficult to get food due to STUPID COVID capacity restrictions yet they allow 500 people to sit butt to butt in seating to watch. You gotta see it but it’s a big pain!

This is a bucket list to do and go go go to this place. get there early and get a good seat. We got there at 8.21 AM and it erupted at 8.23 AM, so not much wait. Other than that, its about every 90 minutes. The geyser erupts and can last up to 90 minutes and take lots of pictures and videos. Its so surreal."

Stop in at the visitors center to learn when the geyser will erupt. You can find a place and sit and wait for the eruption or you can walk to the back of the geyser for an awesome view without the crowds, which I recommend. After the eruption, check out the rest of the geysers in the basin. It’s like walking on another planet!"

66,Old_Faithful,Jun 2021 , Family,"Muldrow, OK ",The Quintessential stop,"Old Faithful is the poster child of Yellowstone. It erupts every 1 1/2 to two hours. There is not much shade so remember the sunscreen. There are plenty of places to view the eruption. The eruption is also very quiet, not loud like you might expect. Because it is the most popular spot, expect a lot of people and long lines for food and at the gift shops. At this time they are still using some Covid protocols making lines even longer."

70,Old_Faithful,Apr 2021,not available,"Riverside, CA, ",Predictable Icon,"We visited Old Faithful twice during our late April trip to Yellowstone. The road to approach the site was under construction in both directions towards the entrance with one way only traffic. We arrived around 8:30am for the first visit and around 3pm for the second one. Both times, we had no delays but the construction projects will no doubt delay traffic in the summer months. The Visitor center was still closed for winter, but a big sign informing visitors of the geyser eruption times was still displayed outside of the Visitor Center each day. The restrooms nearby were very clean. On our first visit, we encountered a windy snowstorm and it was freezing, but our excitement didn’t stop us from patiently waiting in the cold to witness this famous geyser eruption. The second visit was a little warmer and more crowded but had better visibility. After that, we were surprised to see a large bison appear out of nowhere on the grass near Old Faithful. A great experience but make sure to check out all the other geysers in Yellowstone , many of which are more exciting or more beautiful."
71,Old_Faithful,May 2021,not available,"Fort Worth, TX ",Yellowstoned!,"We spent time in the park on two consecutive days and still didn't see everything. You could spend a week in the park and probably not be able to see eveything. The first day was cold with a consistent wintry mix of rain, sleet and snow, so we couldn't get any good pics of the mountain tops. We couldn't even get to the geyser on day one because the closer we got the heavier the snow was. Second day was perfect. Lots of great pics. We crossed if off our bucket list, but God willing, we will be back with RV in tow."
72,Old_Faithful,May 2021,not available,"Pierre, SD ",Great place,Saw it erupt three different times. It is just amazing getting there and seeing that. Each eruption was a little different. One of the good things about Old Faithful is knowing the time it is going to erupt so a person is guaranteed to see an eruption.
73,Old_Faithful,May 2021 , Couples,"Tyrone, PA ",An iconic American landmark,"One of the best parts of going to see Old Faithful is getting there. We entered at the Northern gate and started our tour with Old Faithful being the last to see on the day. The roads past Old Faithful, the Southern Loop, was still closed to traffic at the time of our visit. The breathtaking scenery in order to get there is magnificent as well all of the wildlife to encounter. There are bleacher type single rows for visitors to sit and watch for Old Faithful to erupt. There is also a sandwich style sign down by the General Store, about a 5 minute walk from Old Faithful, that they continuously update as to the predicted time that Old Faithful will next erupt. The eruption that we saw lasted for approximately 2-3 minutes but just getting to see one of the most famous landmarks in America was very much worth seeing. Right down to the Buffalo that decided to walk through about 5 minutes before the eruption. If you are planning a trip to Yellowstone this is a must stop location."

They also have a gas station on site for snacks car/tire repair etc..

Old Faithful was true to her schedule with superheated ground water rising high into the air.    Things have changed in the 15 years Tom had previously visited the area, as there is a MASSIVE new visitors center building, but it and the big lodge building is shut down to visitors due to the plague issue.

84,Old_Faithful,Aug 2020,not available,"Florida, ",Ninety-Six Minute Wait,"Old Faithful has been on my bucket list for decades. We were literally at the park's southwest entrance gate three years ago in mid-September 2017, when the park gates all closed just as we arrived, after 17 inches of new snow made many of the park roads treacherous. No one was allowed in. We waited a couple days in the vicinity, hoping for conditions to improve, to no avail. The park remained closed most of the week.    This year, we got smart and showed up in mid-August, when chances of a freak snowfall were minimal. We arrived at the parking lot of the Old Faithful Visitor Center at about 6:15 and took a seat on one of the long benches in the geyser viewing area. Just before 7:50 pm, as the sky was growing dark, the geyser finally blew, after spitting small bursts of steam and water the entire time we watched.    After reading some of the scientific details about Old Faithful in park brochures, we learned that it blows about 20 times daily, and that the water is 400 degrees Fahrenheit. You don't want to venture off the boardwalks because, if the fragile ground caved, you could burn to death. The steam shoots about 180 feet into the air. I captured some exceptional video of Old Faithful in action.    Watching the most famous geyser in the world erupt really was quite spectacular, and worth the hour and a half wait. We could have spent some of that wait exploring the visitor center, but the staff barred entrance for non-maskers. Hubby and I have refused to buy into the fake pandemic and adopted a strict anti-mask policy. So we enjoyed nature instead and waited outside for the show to begin."
85,Old_Faithful,Sep 2020,not available,"Bothell, WA ",Popular And Deserving Of It,"Well you can't come to Yellowstone NP and not see Old Faithful Geyser. Well, you could but it really is something that needs to be done...    True to its name, the geyser erupts predictably which makes hiking around the area easier to manage. Even though it was shoulder season for our visit the parking lot was pretty full, necessitating going through more than once to find a spot. The parking lot is probably what keeps this attraction from getting a fifth star from me. It's really not a fun drive, with one-way signs potentially leading you into someone's cabin (there's currently some construction on the main road too which doesn't help).    Because this is probably the park's most popular attraction the crowds start seating themselves immediately after an eruption to wait for the next one. I recommend getting seated on the south side of the geyser if you want to avoid getting any of the crowd in your shots as well as to have a bluer sky background. But having people in the picture does give a height perspective. Just pay attention to the wind direction to avoid having the eruption blocked out by its steam.    I'd recommend arriving early in the morning unless you're one of the smart ones who booked a cabin (a year in advance) on-site. The morning and evening skies add to the geyser eruption's majesty."
86,Old_Faithful,Sep 2020,not available,"Coldwater, OH ",See it in real life!,"I’ve seen millions of photos and videos of Old Faithful erupting but they don’t compare to seeing it in real life. The temperature was around freezing the first morning, so the eruption was mostly steam. Amazing! We waited over an hour on a warmer, sunny afternoon and it was amazing again in a different sort of way.  There are lots of benches to sit on, and a large grassy area for seating. But getting there at the last minute and standing in the back still gives one the experience.  No matter the weather, Old Faithful is worth the wait."
87,Old_Faithful,Oct 2020 , Couples,"Redding, CT ",Try and arrive early,"We were very fortunate that we just happened to arrive about 30 mins before the next eruption and were able to grab one of the last available front row seats. Even though we were just ‘out of season’ (early October) all seats were taken well before ‘the action’. The fact that Old Faithful is the ‘star attraction’ means that it has to be on the list but it’s best if you can get there early as there is so much more to see in the park. The earlier you are, the easier you will get in and out, especially of the parking lot, which is huge."

We were fortunate enough to witness six (6) eruptions... my favorites were the Riverside Geyser and Morning Glory Pool.    Old Faithful gets all the ink but the other features are the true stars."

HOWEVER, the eruption is only a few minutes long and it's not nearly as awesome as it appears on TV. It's 'cool' but I wish we had those two hours (parking, waiting, traffic leaving) back to see other stuff in the park)"
92,Old_Faithful,Sep 2020,not available,"Lakeside, CA ",The iconic park experience,I think Old Faithful is even more representative of Yellowstone than bison or the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. It is amazing that it has erupted relatively predictably for so long and continues to do so. It is crowded but there is also a lot of parking and a lot of space to spread out to see it erupt. I liked having the crowd in my photos as it lends scale to the eruption and they are part of the reality of visiting the park.
93,Old_Faithful,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Greenville, SC ",Cool!,"Old faithful is very faithful. The prediction of eruption is pretty spot on... +/- 15 minutes. This was cool to watch and something to cross off the list. Its very crowded and is indeed like leaving a concert after the eruption (traffic, packed restroom lines, etc)    There's other geysers you can walk to, which we did after the eruption. It was a very hot walk with absolutely no shade. I couldn't imagine doing this walk during the summer months! Bring water and sunscreen if you decide to see other geysers. Also keep your eyes open as bison popped up along the trail, randomly... the park rangers were rather late to the scene to warn people of this...."

96,Old_Faithful,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Marlboro, NJ ",Nice but not the most exciting,"All the hype is about this Geyser so of course we had to come. But I’m slightly disappointed because although it faithfully erupts every hour, it isn’t the best I’ve seen. There was another Geyser on the hike from Biscuit Basin that was even better. It was also very crowded as the lodge and inns are all there. Depending on where you stand, you might get sprayed on. When dispersing, it’s like leaving a concert with everyone lining up at the bathroom. The hike there is great though as there are bison and other geysers to see."

There are seats along the outside but only two rows of benches. In mid-day, those seats are gone an hour before it erupts. I could see how with small children they would get tired of standing the whole time. Very clean and restrooms are close by. Park service has done a great job preserving nature while allowing us to enjoy it."

111,Old_Faithful,Aug 2020 , Family,"Bay City, MI, ",A Yellowstone Right of Passage!,"Watching Old Faithful Geyser erupt is a Yellowstone National Park tradition. People from all over the world have journeyed here to watch this famous geyser. The park’s wildlife and scenery might be as well-known today, but it was the unique thermal features like Old Faithful Geyser that inspired the establishment of Yellowstone as the world’s first national park in 1872.    Old Faithful is one of nearly 500 geysers in Yellowstone and one of six that park rangers currently predict. It is uncommon to be able to predict geyser eruptions with regularity and Old Faithful has lived up to its name, only lengthening the time between eruptions by about 30 minutes in the last 30 years.    Old Faithful erupts about every 90 minutes now give it take 10 minutes they say. During peak season you should arrive about an hour before to get a good seat or viewing spot. We saw the last daylight eruption that was projected for 8:01pm but went at 7:43pm.    The eruption lasts between 1 1/2 minutes to 5 minutes. Ours lasted 3:43.    Unfortunately we had a 2 hours drive back to Gardiner so we could not check out the rest of the thermal activity the basin had to offer.    Huge parking lot. WiFi, yes I said WiFi. Restrooms. Some wearing masks, few social distancing because of the crowds. If you don’t want to be near someone I would recommend skipping this one. Otherwise, enjoy and check it off your bucket list."

We waited almost an hour and a 1/2 for it to go off, but I got a good 2 minute video of the eruption. There were several Bison around the geyser so many park rangers had to be around to keep everyone at least 25 feet away.

I then decided to take one of the nearby hikes around the other geysers, which is hot but very cool.    A lot of people like to get up close to it and will sit in the hot sun for over an hour waiting. That is not necessary. It is big enough to see from a distance. Once it is over you can congratulate yourself for seeing it, check it off, and move to more interesting parts of the park.

Some tips: if you see a small crowd gathered around Geyser it means that it just had erupted, if you see a lot of people around it means that eruption can occur pretty soon.  Average time between eruptions 65-75 minutes.  Also, there is a board near info center / store where you can find next approximate eruption time.  In any case it one of the must see places in Yellowstone. Definitely recommend it!"
126,Old_Faithful,Aug 2020 , Family,"Nice, France, ",Overrated,"Like big crowds? Jammed together on hot, cold or otherwise miserable days? Waiting, hoping this is the occasional “big one”? Traveling the rest of the way through the park with the same traffic jam leaving here? Did you stock up on lame souvenirs? This is the place.  Personally, I prefer the bigger, more reliable and picturesque Yellowstone geyser, about ten miles north: the Steamboat Geyser."
127,Old_Faithful,Aug 2020,not available,"Gainesville, GA ",Still Faithful,It is indeed still Old Faithful. We joined the crowd as the time posted by the park drew near and were not disappointed. It is indeed a wonder to see. Do take the time to walk the path around the geyser.
128,Old_Faithful,Aug 2020 , Couples,"Little Falls, MN ",A must see,One thing I would make sure to do when you go is check the time! It’s written in several places around the glacier. I know this sounds dumb to say but we found some good seats and just waited. Then we laughed because we had no idea when it would go off and did not have enough service to get it to load on the website. Old faithful was awesome!
129,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Hillsboro, ND ",Beautiful Old Faithful,"Old Faithful was amazing. Was not sure what to expect, but WOW, when she did her show it was beautiful. Try to get a seat in between times and just watch as there are smaller geysers in the area as well. It was a gorgeous July day when we were there and it was delightful to just watch nature doing it's thing. It did blow a little higher than I thought it would, so had to adjust camera, but caught most of it on video, Was amazing on how it kept going as it got smaller after the large blow. Wish the man in front of me would of been more careful, his head is in my video though. LOL"
130,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Rexburg, ID ",Always a treat to see this marvel of nature!,"This beautiful geyser is always exciting to see. During our visit there were quite a few people, so we stayed away from the crowd and viewed two eruptions whilst hiking around to the other features nearby. Most people were wearing masks, so I felt pretty safe. The down side is that the visitor center is closed, and there is one main outdoor restroom for the entire place, so there was a wait of about a half hour. We found a one seater near morning glory pool, which was clean and only a minimal wait, but quite a walk west of the Old Faithful visitor's center. Be aware that there is often road work, and traffic congestion this year. I did note an absence of tour buses, but more RV's than usual."
131,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Cypress, CA ",Gool Ol Faithful,"There much more to see here than just Old Faithful! It goes off roughly every 91 minutes so use the down time to walk around and see the other geysers and bubbling pools.  There's food, bathrooms and shops. I had cell signal here which is tough to come by. There's also lodging here too."
132,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Old Faithful was faithful!,"On a Saturday morning in July, the parking lot was quite empty on our arrival. (Only one gift store was open but they had a restroom!) The walk to Old Faithful was about three blocks. On the way, a ranger gave us the expected next time for Old Faithful's performance. At the viewing area, not much social distancing going on and 50/50 masks. We chose to ""camp"" at the far north end (left side facing geyser) and were able to have some space. Amazingly, Old Faithful spouted exactly on time, based on previous. While we waited, we saw beautiful birds flitting around and to the northwest a geyser was spouting for the entire time we were there!! All of our kids took photos and videos and were impressed. Good time for all."
133,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Draper, UT ",It is a zoo,we couldnt even hit this spot because it was a zoo!!!!!!! 45 minutes for a 1 mile drive (there was road work at the entrance. Seems like you should stay in this area if you want to have first dibs on this site. We were there in the evening...which is was a zoo as well.
134,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020 , Family,"East Brunswick, NJ ",It's a geyser and a predictable one!,"I don't know how to rate mother nature's performance on this one, so i've figured 5 stars is the way to go. Not the most impressive geyser in the park, but the most popular and we saw it at it's best. Mission accomplished!"
135,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available, ,Keep your expectations low and you will love it,"Because it's the most famous geyser, most people have super high expectations of this geothermal feature of Yellowstone. Since I had heard it was ""just ok,"" I went in expecting ""not much"" and instead LOVED IT! It's astounding to think that every 75-90 for YEARS, this geyser has spurted 8,000 gallons of water over 100 feet in the air! I thought it was absolutely amazing, and I am so happy that my family and I got to witness it. We heard the first eruption of the morning was at 9:17, so we arrived around 10:15, and someone in the crowd told us the next eruption was estimated at 10:54. We secured a place on the boardwalk for our party of nine (most of the seating was taken), and waited. It was pretty hot that day and there is no shade here. Make sure to take water and a few smart people had umbrellas. There was quite a crowd, but we packed lunch so we wouldn't have to fight the throngs of people. The thing is... after you watch Old Faithful, you can walk Upper Geyser Basin to see multiple features! If you walk the entire two miles, you can witness the awesome Morning Glory! Just be prepared with water and grit to take this walk there and back. It was worth it, but I'm not sure everyone in our party was mentally prepared for it. I loved every single site, and we got to see another geyser in the basin erupt as well. Highly recommend to put on your patient panties and just take your time! Unforgettable!"
136,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"West Fargo, ND ",Little Overrated,"Very crowded and really bad cafeteria food options. Old Faithful is a little underwhelming compared to other sites in Yellowstone like Pristmatic Spring, Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, and Steamboat Geyser."
137,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"York, SC ",Iconic sight,"When we arrived, Old Faithful had just erupted. We decided to walk the trails around until it was time to erupt again. We started walking, and walking, and walking. Probably walked 3 miles. Anyway, there are lots of other geysers in this same area. There are also many hot pools. Such a different landscape than anywhere else we had ever been. We made it back and decided to watch the eruption from the opposite side of where the large crowd gathers. It was awe-inspiring to see it erupt. There is lots of steam, so kind of hard to see the main plume. Still, it is great to say we visited this famous icon."
138,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Highland, UT ",Old Faithful- beautiful nature,We loved Old Faithful. I have wanted to go ever since I was in 8th grade and my friend returned from her trip. The geyser first off about every 1 hour and 10 minutes. Right when you get there you should check the sign to see when it will go off. If you have more than 30 minutes than quickly start hiking the trail to the tiger geysers. There are a lot of cool ones. Then watch the geyser go off form afar. We ended up spending two hours here. We watched it first close up with only 10 minutes to eruption when we arrived. Then we watched it again from afar. If you are short on time then don’t do the higher lookout. Whatever you do don’t only watch it with the other thousand spectators. Take a hike!
139,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Lexington, KY ",Very interesting to see the Geyser erupt.,We were in an RV during C-19 while tourism is down. The parking lot for the hotel was wide open. Park here and walk over to see what ever you want. There is a phone # (307) 344-7381 that you can call for Geyser prediction.. USE it to plan the trip through the park. Very handy. We watched it twice.
140,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020 , Family,"Pulaski, TN ",Awesome,"We were there in the June, this was our first stop that morning. Parking was not an issue it was early also there is a lot of parking. This should be an early morning stop prepare to stay a half day, there are so much to see around Old Faithful. You can download the Yellowstone App and it will give the times for the geysers to erupt. There are restaurants and restrooms here."
141,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020 , Family,"Pittsburgh, PA ",First stop,The visitor center posts the approximate time Old Faithful will go off. We arrived at 8 am to watch an 8:36 eruption. It seems a little over rated but was one of the stops we were looking forward to.
142,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020 , Family,"Saint Louis, MO ",Over rated,There are much more spectacular hotsprings and much more beautiful views in the park. We watched it. It was lackluster in our opinion
143,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020 , Family,"Maple Grove, MN, ",Hike up to Geyser Hill for best view,"Times are posted by rangers and pretty accurate. We hiked up to Geyser Hill overlooking the Old Faithful area and enjoyed our first views from there. This area gets crowded, so if you've already seen the geyser erupt, then it's a good time to do some shopping or get a meal."
144,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020,not available,"Alta Loma, CA ",Old faithful,Old Faithful! I guess i was expecting more of it since it was the famous geyser is not the famous attraction in YNP. We arrived just in time for its eruption. We were not on the front lines but it's OK since we do not want to be in close proximity with other visitors due to the pandemic. It was not as crowded. We also visited on their first week of opening so the hotels and lodges within the park was still closed during our visit at the park.
145,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Watsonville, CA ",petty much on time,the main problem is the crowds. Nobofy is observing the 6 feet distance rule.  I stood in the back as I havd been here before many times so I did not need to get closer to othet people.  Old Faithful never fails
146,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020,not available,"Nashville, Tennessee, United States ",At night was best,"We stayed at the lodge cabins, and so we saw Old Faithful erupt 5 times but the best was at night when it was less crowded and not so cold that the steam overpowered the view of the geyser."
147,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020 , Solo,NYC ,Underwhelming,"After seeing and hearing about old faithful forever I finally had a chance to see it. I have to admit, while stunning to see, it was a bit underwhelming. Not as high or strong as I thought the eruption would be. Nonetheless I don’t regret seeing it and would recommend to everyone."
148,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020 , Couples,"Edinburg, TX ",Truly Faithful,"The Old Faithful Geyser is an amazing site to behold. It goes of for more than 2 minutes and it’s just amazing to watch. There are benches all around the safe area where people can sit down. We entered Yellowstone Park through the South entrance. We paid $35/person to get through Teton National Park going to the South entrance. Normally you’d pa another $35/person to enter Yellowstone but maybe because of the pandemic, we didn’t have to pay anything. The prices of the entrance fees are posted at the gate. Once you’re inside Yellowstone, you can see all the geysers and Old Faithful. Definitely something you shouldn’t miss."
149,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020,not available,"Kingwood, TX ",not on time but did not disappoint,"Old Faithful was 17 minutes late than the posted time, but it gives you warning of the eruption with tiny flare ups. Lots of seating but pay attention to the wind direction; sit up wind so you get the best pictures. You have time for a selfie!"
150,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020,not available,"Montgomery, IL, ",Just see this,Everyone that goes to Yellowstone needs to see this at least once. The average between eruptions is 92 mins according to our guide. Plenty of places to sit around it.  Gift shops and plenty of parking near by.
151,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020,not available,"Canton, GA ",Don't Miss Old Faithful,Definitely not to be missed when you visit Yellowstone. You can check eruption time online to help time your trip. It's still easy to see and photograph if you are off the boardwalk. We arrived about 15 minutes before eruption. It was spectacular.
152,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020,not available,"Louisville, KY ","Cold day, but worth the wait","It feels like Old Faithful is a must see feature of the park. We arrived in time for a mid-morning eruption. It was very, very cold that morning which made it hard to stand around and wait. The actual eruption was very much worth waiting for. However, because of the cold we did not walk around the rest of the geysers in this area. Definitely, glad we saw it, but the cold about did us in! We did see more than a half dozen other geysers erupting during our visit in the park."
153,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020 , Couples,"Madera, CA ",Incredible,"This is an iconic stop in Yellowstone NP. We visited on a rainy Saturday, arriving late morning. We had a lot of parking to choose from as the previous eruption had ended about fifteen minutes prior. We hung out on the porch of the art gallery in their rocking chairs and waited for the next one. The nps.gov site has approximate (+/-10min) eruption times with 90% accuracy. The eruption lasted several minutes. As it was dying down, we made our way to the lodge for lunch from the cafeteria. The best thing we got was the bison “slider” on the kids meal. Highly recommend that."
154,Old_Faithful,Jul 2020 , Family,"Bloomsburg, PA ","Nice, check nps.gov for time",Make sure you go online and check the eruption time. We arrived 15 minutes before erupted and it was spectacular.

155,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020,not available,"Mantorville, MN, ",A Must Do,"This old stalwart of the park is a must do for every visitor to Yellowstone. It has been the crown jewl of the park since its opening. There is a great deal of parking, there are dining, shopping, and restroom options nearby as you await the next eruption. The eruption is easily seen from a variety of viewing points. Don't pass this one up."
156,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020 , Family,"Orlando, FL ",Classic and inspiring,this is a class I can one of the most well-known parts of the park for a reason. There's a very nice viewing area but you definitely want to plan to spend a few hours in the area. I would recommend first getting a spot to view an eruption. once you see it then I would go to the basin behind old faithful and view those geysers and features as well. Then try to time it so when you swing back through you can see an eruption again from a different angle. You definitely have to plan to see this while you're there.
157,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Once in a lifetime experience,We waited for the Old Faithful eruption and it was worth it! Nature is on full display at Yellowstone and this is a must see. Amazing!
158,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020,not available,"Troy, KS ",About the only really handicapped accessible part of the park,"My husband & I visited Yellowstone on our honeymoon 25 years ago. We took our family this time. My husband was suddenly disabled a year ago and had to be in a wheelchair this time. This was the only attraction not visible from the car that he could actually see! The boardwalks are impossible for a regular wheelchair as the boards would sink under the weight and it would not roll - as if going over rough doorframes one after another - could not actually get rolling. He saw the park from the car - able to stand and walk a few steps - he was able to use the restrooms, but none of the paths were actually accessible. Bittersweet."
159,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020 , Family,"Chicago, IL, ",Great stop,I stopped here today. People spaced out pretty well with the Coronavirus. Some had masks. The eruption was as awesome as always. It was a little late. My kids loved it.

162,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,"Phoenix, AZ ",Crazy to see,We were only able to spend a half day here at this park but it has so much to offer. The park is so large and wide open that you can see so much just from driving from one attraction to the next. The most popular sites will be full of people throughout the day so we’d suggest viewing them early. Old Faithful has only a certain number of times it goes off per day so that should be one of the first you visit since it is time sensitive and the times aren’t all equally apart. This also gives you an opportunity to see what the park rangers suggest to visit and even see some of their informational presentations of the park. Considering there are so many unique features here it is cool to learn more about the park especially all of the hot springs here. We hope to be back for several days next time and camp at one of the many campgrounds they have along the rivers!  - @wanderingwithustwo
163,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA ",Check Prediction Time,Check the nps website for the prediction times to eruptions for Old Faithful and all the different geysers around. We also did the 2 mile bike route to Morning Glory and discovered other geysers along the way. It was paved and easy to get around. Old Faithful gets really crowded during show time. We decided to stay in the OF lodge on a cabin with one double bed. It was super convenient to end the day here and started early the next morning. We saw OF erupt multiple times because we stayed on site. Loved exploring the area!
164,Old_Faithful,Jun 2020 , Couples, ,Faithfully on Time,Old Faithful was scheduled to erupt at 1:50 pm with a +/- 10 min window. It started at 1:52 pm. Cool to watch. Would recommend it once.
165,Old_Faithful,May 2020 , Family,"Temuco, Chile ",Family,We enjoyed walking and seeing all the geysers. Old Faithful was nice but while we were there other ones were more active than that one.
166,Old_Faithful,May 2020,not available,"Minot, ND ",Old Faithful,"I have been to Old Faithful a couple different times. This time was different because of the park being open on a limited basis. They still was crowd, but not packed. Most people were social distancing and some wearing masks. Sitting and waiting for Old Faithful to make her appearance , you have plenty of scenery to look at. Make sure you are calling the number or checking the app to see the eruption schedule so you get there in plenty of time to find a good spot to watch from . And walk the boardwalks !"
167,Old_Faithful,Oct 2019,not available,"Bristol, UK ",underwhelming,its worth a visit if you're in the park. It's like waiting for a firework display or a drive by by a celebrity.  Old Faithful is clearly getting old.
168,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Family,Massachusetts ,Just ok,It’s great that Old Faithful’s eruptions are so punctual but they are also  So crowded!! The boardwalk is nice but also very crowded. If you are limited on time in Yellowstone I would skip Old Faithful and go to Lamar Valley West Thumb instead
169,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Plymouth, MA ",Overrated,"The surrounding are was packed. There was nowhere to sit and it wasn't even that exciting.

It was still incredible and a once in a lifetime moment!! There is a boardwalk trail where you can see many other geothermal sites and a short trail to an observation point which is where we watched her erupt. I honestly would've preferred to have been closer, but it was still amazing to see and from a unique perspective. When you arrive, there is a sign that tells you the approximate time she will erupt. Get your seats early because they fill up very fast. The cafeteria had good food also, but people were absolute savages. Regardless, you MUST see Old Faithful on your trip to Yellowstone."
173,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019,not available,"Albuquerque, NM, ",Impressive but not Awe Inspiring,"Given all the hype surrounding Old Faithful, it would be surprising if it truly lived up to its reputation. In my opinion, it did not. It is an impressive geyser but, at least when we saw it erupt, the plume was not as big as some photos I have seen. Still, it is a big geyser and the big plus is the fact it is predictable and accessible. We saw it on a sunny morning with about 300 other people in early September. It was easy to get to and easy to view. Impressive, but frankly not awe inspiring."
174,Old_Faithful,Dec 2019,not available,"Buelach, Switzerland ",Grand classis and must be on anybody's list,"If you want to experience old faithful ""almost on your own"", winter is when you want to visit.    Very little people compared to summer, so no pushing and interfering - everybody gets great photo shots and/movies.    And the other geysers you frequently have really all for yourself if you follow the snowed-in boardwalks.  Bring along warm clothes, though, to enjoy the place and not suffer from the cold - it CAN get REALLY cold !"
175,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019,not available,"Cottage Grove, MN ",Worth the wait,"On our first full day in the park we headed from our cabin toward the Old Faithful lodge when we were waylaid by a mass of people standing around Old Faithful. Naturally, we couldn't resist the most famous site in the park so we joined them. There is a sign in one of the nearby buildings stating that the geyser erupts every 35 to 120 minutes, plus or minus 15. Well most people had been waiting for some time when we got there. There was rumbling and a bit of spitting and everyone would grab their cameras only to find out it was a false alarm. After this happened a number of times it became quite funny with just about everyone there having a good time. It finally erupted about 20 minutes later and it was worth seeing. All in all we saw it erupt 3-4 times during our stay. Recommended!"

Check with the visitor center or there is a site to find out predicted eruption times. Note, these are +/- about 10 minutes.  -There are some additional walking trails around Old Faithful to see other geysers that you can tour while you are waiting for it to erupt. There is usually ample seating  When we visited, it had a few slow starts over about a 5 minute period of time and then it erupted so you may need to be patient. If you’re pressed for time during your visit, coordinate stopping here around the predicted eruption time. You’ll want to give yourself about 30 minutes before the predicted time to park and walk there."

Easy access for wheelchairs, walkers. An absolute national park everyone should see, and there is so much more to do!! Take the path to Morning Glory pool while there. Viewed bison also. Lunch or dinner at the lodge is a bit overpriced but a good experience."
189,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019,not available,"Wickenburg, AZ, ",Major magnet,"Ol' Faithrful is certainly one of the main magnet of Yellowstone NP. This is because it errupts with regularity and it erupts highest - as far as predictable. Therefre you have large viewing platforms with benches, mainy on the side of the large lodges with coffee shop, restaurant, and, you guessed, gift shop of course, and there is ample parking, too. However, check out the direction of the wind, since if you stand downwind, what you'll mostly see is a column of steam rather than the actual water spout, and in wamer weather the water spout is more ipressive. Even though IMHO, ther are more fascinating features in the park, this is definitely a spot not to be missed."
190,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,"Llanidloes, UK ",Underwhelming,I know it's a natural phenomenon but it was slightly underwhelming. Worth the visit to see it though.

The height is reaches is impressive this is an absolute must if your in Yellowstone National Park.    It can get very hot in summer and waiting between 44/125 minutes can be tough, we just missed an eruption upon arriving and decided to hire bike, there is a great track leading to a collection on hot pools that are stunning it only a 30 minute round trip nice and flat so great for the kids, we spent 10 minutes taking pics and exploring and headed back in perfect time to see Old Faithful erupt.    Beware as this is a very popular attraction it is usually very busy, you don’t need to be right at the front it erupts to a hight of over 50meters it’s more comfortable slightly further back!"

193,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019,not available,"Valhalla, NY, ",Impressive,Old Faithful is not the best geyser in the park but it is the easiest to see being right off the loop road and near the visitors center in addition to going off on a failry reliable schedule. We stayed at the Old Faithful Inn so I saw it go off 6 different times in the 2 days I was there. During the day there are crowds but one morning I saw it go off at 5:30 a.m. and there were only 4 of us out there.
194,Old_Faithful,Oct 2019,not available,"Coral Springs, FL ",Definitely worth a stop,"While there are so many places to visit in Yellowstone, this geyser is the best known. It takes little effort to get there. The parking lot is huge to accomodate crowds. The Old Faithful Visitor Center is right there to take care of any needs. The Old Faithful Inn is also closeby, so stop and look around. We arrived shortly before it was scheduled to erupt, so we hurried over to the stands. Got a front row seat easily. No matter your thoughts, the eruption is exciting to watch. We saw it from the front row and from another area of the geyser basin. If you are able, take some time and stroll around some of the other features of this area. Old Faithful is not the only feature, just the most well known."

There are lots of geysers in the park, over 10,000 of them. I'd suggest hiking about a bit to see equally exciting geysers with fewer people at the other geyser fields. And don't forget the other geothermal features, which to my taste are just as interesting."

We used our wait time wisely :) We walked around for awhile and then a drink and dinner in the Bear Pit, the bar in the Old Faithful Inn.

Next eruption was 10 minutes late according to Ranger estimate. First has a little eruption, then had a lot of smoke, and subsequently had a huge beautiful eruption that lasted minutes. Was very impressive when it finally came. So don’t give up, after all she is Old Faithful."

I had a Yellowstone app that shows predicted geyser eruptions, but cell reception is not a given. We made it to the Old Faithful area in plenty of time and found ample parking available. The Old Faithful Geyser viewing area is just a few minute walk from the parking lot.    The viewing area has a boardwalk around the geyser with bench seating, close enough that you can feel the geyser spray and smell sulfur if the wind is blowing your way.    Old Faithful erupted within 2 minutes of the predicted time, lasting well over a minute.    There is a gift shop and a few places to eat in the area."
219,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019,not available,"Sydney, Australia ",Something different,"So my husband and I were staying right in the Old Faithful area so saw her go off a lot over the 4 days spent there. She is beautiful and does go off regularly and the visitors centre there at Old Faithful post times when she is ""expected"" to go off. There is seating along the boardwalk in front of her and the area is completely flat. Interesting to see but much better to be there once all the tour buses and crowds have gone. To be there alone at night in the pitch black and see her go off and hear how loud she actually sounds without all the crowds there was amazing. Plus look up and see the gorgeous stars. Worth seeing at least once."

After waiting over an hour in the cold and wind, Old Faithful went off. The height was a bit disappointing but it was memorable none the less.

223,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019,not available,"Dallas, TX ",Beautiful and worth the visit,During the day the busses come and the amount of people there is nauseating. After 4PM the people leave the park and you are there practically by yourself. A beautiful sunset/sunrise and stroll through the geysers with no crowds even during a high crowd season. Go and enjoy. Take the hike to Imperial Geyser (the picture with my husband and I the others are of Old Faithful). We were the only ones there for hours. It was breathtaking. Take a lunch and enjoy the bison strolling by and the geyser erupting.

Plenty of cool geysers and springs along the way. Old Faithful is super impressive to witness and the predicted eruption time is usually reliable. It erupts roughly every hour. Visitor Center is worth a visit too!"

Plenty of parking for our motorhome and we had a fairly short walk to the spectator area. Since we had almost an hour until the next eruption, I took one of the trails around the geyser basin and saw the eruption of one of the ""minor"" geysers but it was very impressive. The entire walk through this ""Hell on the surface"" was fantastic. I returned to the main spectator area and joined my wife for the O.F. eruption. It happened a few minutes early and only lasted about 46 seconds. Not disappointed, but enjoyed the other parts of the area much more. Beautiful and dynamic area that more folks should see."

There are several parking lots that can accommodate a variety of vehicles. Old Faithful is one of the most popular areas of the park and therefore the most crowded. There are benches near the geyser for you to sit and wait for the next eruption. Limited covered seating is also available at the Old Faithful Lodge. For great views of Old Faithful erupting, I suggest hiking up to Observation Point for a bird’s eye view. Visiting early or late in the day usually avoids the majority of the crowds. A boardwalk trail around the area provides views of different thermal features."

236,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019 , Solo,"Boynton Beach, FL, ",Icon of Nature,"Located adjacent to Old Faithful Inn, this massive geyser is as famous as Yellowstone itself. It’s amazing to think that OF has been erupting ‘on schedule’ to the delight of millions for decades. The area does get quite crowded prior to eruption time (this would be a good time to explore the lobby of Old Faithful Inn without crowds). Seating bleachers surround part of OF, granting visitors prime viewing. When not erupting, a steady ribbon of steam is emitted."
237,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019 , Family,"Temecula, CA ",Magnificent!,Our first day we made the trek to Old Faithful and were left in awe of its beauty and history. We got Junior Ranger books from the visitor center (FYI: they charge $3 a book) we also attended a Ranger talk at old faithful which was so informative and enjoyable for our whole family. Definitely one of our favorite things we saw. The estimate timing is pretty accurate. They say +\- 10 mins and good thing they do it erupted 3 mins early so I was glad we got there early.
238,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Modesto, CA ",On time,"Old Faithful never disappoints.  We saw a larger geyser erupting when we first pulled in but Old Faithful you can almost set your watch to.The predicted erupt time was 10:43am and she started erupting at that time.  Get there early as the seats fill quickly.  It doesn’t take long for 8000 gallons of water to erupt,but always cool to witness.  There are cooler things to see in the park but this is a must see every time."

243,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019,not available,"Ashland, OH ",Old Faithful is Something Everyone Needs to Witness.,I try to visit Yellowstone once a year if I can and I always take time to watch Old Faithful do its thing. Best times to witness an eruption are early or late in the day when some of the crowds had long left. There have been several times when I've had the viewing area all to myself! Best advice I can give is to stay in the park at the Old Faithful Area and you can take a short walk to view this geyser as well as many of the others at just about any time. Also keep an eye on the sun. Viewing is best with the sun behind you or at an angle to make the water jet more visible.
244,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019 , Family,"Augusta, GA ",Check the App for Times,Plenty of seating and easy to take photos. The eruption varies 15 minutes from the time and will last well over sixty seconds. Well worth the visit

But finally we were rewarded with a burst. My wife took several pictures and a couple of videos to share with friends and family. My wife had never seen a geyser before so this was special. They do have benches to sit on while waiting so that helps. Plus the lodge is nearby for snacks and clean restrooms. Hey, it’s also warm there."

I am still amazed by the fact Old Faithful Geyser eruption can be predicted within a 10 to 15 minute window. That one geologic prediction is why I keep going by Old Faithful. There have been 1,000,000 eruptions recorded. Yes, the eruption lasts anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes long, so it is a short lived eruption. You can expect the geyser boiling water plume to go up 100 to 185 feet high. It is not the tallest or largest geyser in the park, but it is truly a remarkable sight. Get there early to find you the best front row seat on the boardwalk."

We had seen the Geysir in Iceland some years back and that one is far more spectacular that Old Faithful and you don’t have to wait over 90 minutes per eruption. Sorry folks, I know this is review will be controversial to some, but that’s just the way things are! The whole area is amazing from a geological point of view, it’s just the hype around this geyser is played up too much. Still worth a visit, though..."

I've seen it erupt multiple times and have often followed eruptions on the online website. Old Faithful's claim to fame is its fairly predictable eruption timeline. I've since discovered there are other more impressive geyser eruptions...they are just less predictable and you can never be sure you'll get to see them on one visit (Beehive, Grand geyser for two). Old Faithful is an American Icon and a not to be missed vista."

It’s now roped off quite a bit for safety reasons, but many places to sit, and lots of stuff to do if you’ve just missed it.

We arrived and made our way to the site only to find that it would be sometime before it next erupted so we went to the visitor centre and waited. We were told a time roughly when it would happen. It finally erupted and it lacked the spectacular eruption I had seen of old. Perhaps it is running out of steam!

Only because Grand, Beehive and several other geysers put on an even better show. So don’t limit yourself to OF. See it because it is easy and predictable. But make the effort to hike out to some of the others. They are less frequent but the visitor center will list their predicted times and you will be in for a treat."

The time of the next eruption is displayed but to get a front row seat close up after 9am you need to arrive at least 30 minutes in advance. The best seat in the house is from the balcony in the Old Faithful Inn it is some way off and not publicised.

280,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019,not available,"Nashua, NH ",Do it to say you did it,"I think I was more drawn to Old Faithful because everyone knows it. It wasn't my first geyser I'd seen so overall it was a standard eruption. It is very busy and heavily watched so if you would like to get up close and personal with this attraction you have to start staking out the spot an hour in advance. I think I had a great time pulling up a few minutes before it erupted and got a spot that had few people in my camera angle. I think that it is an attraction you should go and see, but I wouldn't dedicate too much time to it."

I waited for about 45 minutes on the benches around it for it to go off. We had hiked most of the day so when I heard a ranger suggest to someone else to go to another geyser that was going to go off in ten minutes and it was a better viewing but it was a bit of a walk away I didn't go, but I wish I had."
283,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019,not available,"New York City, NY ",Best to watch geyser eruption,"The best spot to watch geyser eruption as it is the most reliable prediction spot.

284,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available, ,The Geyser that erupts predictably through the eons.,"Old Faithful Geyser, Yellowstone    Yellowstone’s most famous geyser is the Old Faithful Geyser. It is a cone geyser located at Upper Geyser Basin in the southwest section of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, United States. It currently erupts around 20 times a day. These eruptions are predicted with a 90 percent confidence rate, within a 10 minute variation, based on the duration and height of the previous eruption. Because of this highly predictable geothermal feature, it has coined the name the Old Faithful.  Though Old Faithful is not the tallest or largest geyser in the park, it ejects steam-water mixture into the air at extreme force. The largest geyser being the less predictable Steamboat Geyser.  Here there is a ranger station that tracks the time, height and length of an eruption to predict the next eruption. More than 1,000,000 eruptions have been recorded. Eruptions can shoot 3,700 to 8,400 US gallons (14,000 to 32,000 L) of boiling water to a height of 106 to 185 feet (32 to 56 m) lasting from 1 1⁄2 to 5 minutes. The average height of an eruption is 145 feet (44 m). At 22 m of its depth, the water is at 118 degrees Celsius.  The geyser-viewing area is the most accessible and visitor-friendly in the park with bench seating, a large parking lot and it is most comfortably visible from the lounge of Old Faithful Cabin & Lodge."

286,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019 , Friends,United States ,Amazing place!!!,"Place is clean and well maintained, would recommend to come on a weekday to avoid crowds. Lots of parking and spots to seat and enjoy the view while waiting for the geyser to blow. Amazing experience and would recommend this place to check out while on Yellowstone National Park."
287,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Las Vegas, NV ",Luck was on our side,We had just finished eating at Old Faithful Lodge and walked over to the visitor center. The geyser had just started to erupt so we got to see it and not have to wait another 90 minutes. Amazing.

289,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,"Los Angeles, CA ",Anti-climactic...,"I'm sure in the right conditions this would be something to behold but it was insanely crowded and a bit anti-climactic. It would be foolish not to stop by when you're in Yellowstone just because this is such an iconic site but it was overhyped compared to the beauty of the park in general and was so packed with tourists it felt a bit like Disneyland. That said, even with the lackluster ""gurgle"" it was still a memorable experience for me as it was amusing to watch everyone waiting for something to happen..."
290,Old_Faithful,Sep 2019 , Family,"Kaysville, UT ",Packed and stacked at Old Faithful,"We got there about 10:15 in the morning and it was already bustling with people and activity.    Get there earlier in the day and it should be less crowded. However there are tons of shops, dining options, and the Grand Lodge to view while you wait for Old Faithful to start up again. It goes off every 60-90 minutes so if you get there and it's gone off, wait for a bit and you will be treated again.    ENJOY!!!"
291,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Solo,"Williamsburg, VA, ",A must see,No trip to Yellowstone is not complete if you don't see Old Faithful erupt at least once. It last for a few minutes every 90 minutes give or take 10. Stand back further to get the whole geyser in a picture or get close for a breathtaking experience.
292,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Family,Northern Virginia ,Awesome of course,"A must-see sight. There’s lots to see near old faithful, so you don’t have to sit there just staring at it and waiting for it to erupt, especially since sometimes it erupts late. That said, many many people sit around it, staring at it and waiting. Pro tip— the Old Faithful Inn and general store there have clocks that show when it’s next expected to erupt.    You can also see it erupting from Upper Geyser Basin nearby, and you can be enjoying the basin area while you’re waiting. I saw that there is also an observation area for Old Faithful in the upper geyser basin that was up a hill. But you can see Old Faithful from several areas in the upper geyser basin. See below pic from upper geyser basin boardwalk when Old Faithful was erupting."
293,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Apex, NC ",Right on Time,"We watched Old Faithful three times. Once from the ground near the Inn, once from the opposite side and once from the porch at the Old Faithful Inn. It goes off approximately every one hour and twenty minutes. It puts on a great show and there is lots of water and steam."
294,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Family,"Alberta, Canada ",Finally got to see it!,We got to see this at least three times and each time it was exciting. The location has lots of parking and make sure you walk the boardwalk and hike the trail to see all the Geysers.
295,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Athens, GA ",A Must See,"You really can't go to Yellowstone without seeing Old Faithful. The Old Faithful geyser is spectacular, but the entire property has multiple other geysers and geyser pools. The visitor's center is great, and a visit to the hotel lobby is also a must."
296,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Fernandina Beach, FL ",FAITHFUL IS APT DESCRIPTION,"Schedule of eruptions is posted throughout the park so you will not miss it. Usually occurs within 10 minutes of announced times. There will be about 5 lead-ups with ohs and ahs before the big eruption...not the most specacular in park, but well worth it."
297,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Lowell, MA ",Old Faithful,"We visited Old Faithful on our last day and we were so glad we did. We decided to dedicate the day to concentrate on this area prior to driving back to Jackson. It was busy but not over crowded (we visited the last week of August). The rangers were very informative and knew the approximate time for the next eruption. There is a walkway to walk around the park and view the geysers. The Old Faithful Inn is a great place to visit while there, they also have a couple of other stores. Glad we took our time, we had a great visit to Old Faithful."
298,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Corona, CA, ",Great Area - All Geisers,We were fortunate to stay at the Inn so we had multiple opportunities to enjoy different times of eruptions.  Obviously early morning has very few crowds and you are able to find multiple photo locations.  Timing was pretty close!
299,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Eugene, OR ",Pretty cool.,"I thought it was pretty cool but maybe a bit overrated. We ended up getting there with just a few minutes till an eruption so it ended up being ok, waiting an hour and a half for it my opinion may have been a little different. Definitely worth checking out though."
300,Old_Faithful,Feb 2019 , Solo,Florida ,"This is a famous geyser, but Yellowstone has better ones to see.","Old Faithful erupts quite frequently, and this place gets very crowded. There are plenty of seats, and there are many parking spots in the nearby area. There is also a hotel, gift shops, bathrooms, and water. It was nice to see Old Faithful erupt, but there are bigger geysers, such as Norris’ Steamboat Geyser."
301,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Family,"Guildford, UK ",Very big kettle,Their estimation was almost right (5-10 mins off). So we were all sat down and ready for the famous old faithful to erupt and wow us all.    It didn’t wow me.    You might as well have watched a kettle boil.
302,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Calgary, Canada ",Cool to see,It was not as I thought it would be it was faithful in timing but not as grad as I thought still a must see but there is other Geysers that are bigger and grander there is lots of people to watch it but no bad view so don’t be concerned little ones can always get close
303,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Terre Haute, IN ",Old Faithful,I had heard about the geyser my entire life. I finally made it to see it. It did not disappoint. We got there twenty minutes after an eruption. It spouts every 90 minutes +\- ten minutes. The eruption we witnessed was right on time. It lasts about 4 minutes. Get there early for front row view. It fills up quickly near eruption time. It’s worth waiting for.
304,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019,not available,"Charlottesville, VA ",Always a great place to visit,Our family camping trip included Old Faithful of course. From the moment we arrived at the boardwalk until we left the trails we were treated to eruptions. Hiking on the trails behind the geyswr affords better views without the huge crowds of fellow tourists. Arrive early to avoid the busloads of visitors. Old Faithful seems to be on every itinerary. Carry lots of water if you intend to hike the outlying trails and be sure to visit the lodge for the experience. Of course ice cream at the cafe will make the grandkids happy.
305,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Family,"Chantilly, VA ",Most adored geyser in the world!,"Perhaps the busiest among all the attractions and easiest to visit in Yellowstone. We parked within a minute’s walk from the information center, and beyond a door on the other side, lo and behold, there was the Old Faithful waiting to perform its magic at hourly interval. There are plenty of benches all around to relax. It is best approachable from the West gate, requiring no mountainous driving skills and less than an hour. We came through the South gate, crossing the Grand Tetons, which had major delays due to roadwork and tortuous driving. While driving, there is no cell phone coverage, no elaborate or repeated signs, and no easily reachable park rangers midway. Takes a lot of prep to enjoy nature’s astounding play."
306,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Orlando, FL ",Old Faithful,"You gotta see it, I’m glad I went and saw it, but it’s very underwhelming for me. Too touristy I think.

307,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,"Copenhagen, Denmark ",Impressing geysir area,"Of course the iconic Old Faithful geysir is the main attraction here, but the surrounding geysir area is without a doubt worth visiting, too. Old Faithful only erupts every 80-110 minute. We arrived shortly after an eruption. In the waiting time for the next, we took a walk in the park, a large area with many other geysirs, hotsprings etc. This was at least as impressive as the Old Faithful show."
308,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Saint Louis, MO, ",An iconic activity,"Old Faithful erupts every 90 minutes give or take 30 minutes. As the time gets close to the eruption, people start to line up along the front. Some people have tripods and professional looking equipment. All the rest of the people have cameras and cell phones ready for any action. The geyser starts bubbling and releases a little steam which indicates the eruption is closer. We happened to see a smaller geyser on the side of Old Faithful erupt first, a few minutes before. A nearby worker told us that sometimes all 3 will erupt at once. Old Faithful eruption lasted 1 or 2 minutes so it is easy to take photos. A lot of the kids in the crowd played in the open areas with downed tree logs. Most figured out how to make see saws. They have fun while the adults anticipate the geyser action. There is a walking trail all around the entire area. We enjoyed this but we saw equally impressive geysers in Iceland and geothermal fields in the Azores."
309,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available,Sunshine Bay ,Interesting but underwhelming.,"Came here to witness the infamous shooting geyser. Arrived 10 minutes before it went off, with a moderate crowd already assembled. It erupted to life shortly after, spurting about 8 metres high & lasted 30 seconds or so. Not sure what i expected but after having visited Iceland a few years back, this was underwhelming....."
310,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Lithopolis, OH ",Saw Old Faithful blow twice,"This geyser releases about every 90 minutes. The release lasted about five-ten minutes. I recommend walking the boardwalks to see other geysers. Beehive and Castle Geysers were just as fascinating to see. Castle went higher and for at least half hour. We witnessed a “crazy” who walked into Old Faithful surrounding land where there are clearly signs to not enter, and heard from ranger yelling at him that it was a $2000 fine."

Short but utterly sweet and yes, worth the wait. My friends and my mum were there to witness its eruption, visiting from the UK finally reunited with friends from Las Vegas! We were there at 19.30 and waited more than an hour, 20.34 on its next eruption and boy, weren't we awed! A MUST SEE when in and around Yellowstone :)"

313,Old_Faithful,May 2019,not available,"Brentwood, UK ",Great but from a distance!,The good thing about this geyser is that they have a pretty good idea of when it is going to go - hence the name. But you watch it from a distance - some of the others are better I think because you can get much closer to them. Nevertheless it is a wonder.
314,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,"Prattville, AL ",Worth the wait,"Got there early and got a seat. The estimate as to when it blew was pretty good. this was the second time we got to see it. the first time, we were later and had to be in the second row standing up. Got a good video though. It was pretty easy because we got there just after the last eruption, got to eat at the cafeteria and then had time to get a good seat. It was busy though, a lot of cars. It burbled a bit before the real eruption and the it went off. It blasted for almost 5 minutes and everyone loved it."
315,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Couples,"San Francisco, CA ",Iconic Image of Yellowstone,"Perhaps the best image of the park is Old Faithful. No matter how many times you see it, you marvel at the wonders of nature. Best times to view it are early or late. The sun is in the best position and the crowds are down. The visitor center posts time of eruptions, but they come about every 1.5 hours. There are many benches and it is wheelchair accessible."
316,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019,not available, ,Name says it all,"You can believe in the old faithful part. It was to erupt at 11:45 and it erupted at 11:57, so that's not too far off. Was a beautiful thing to watch."
317,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Family,"Jefferson, PA ",Very crowded,"This entire area is very crowded so be prepared to deal with lots of people, cars, and buses if you’re there during the busy season. It’s the easiest geyser to see because of how often and accurate it is, however once you see it make sure to take the walk around the boardwalk to see the many other areas with geysers and springs. We also saw some male elk one evening in this area. Everything is crowded here - gas station, General Store, Dining Room - so come early or just skip eating there if you can."
318,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,"Chicago, IL ",It is what it is,"So you have to come here - everyone does and there is a reason why. Old Faithful is fun to watch and the (large) audience enjoyed the anticipation of waiting for its next blow, but there are much more interesting thermal features not only scattered throughout the connected geyser basin but also at Norris Geyser Basin. So come here, but also go to Norris."

I've never seen a geyser erupt before, so I was excited to have the opportunity during our visit to Yellowstone National Park. There's an eruption time clock in the Old Faithful Hotel and in the cafe areas, so you know when to head over to the viewing area. It's cool to watch it sputter and spurt before it actually erupts. A simply amazing natural wonder. Please, please, please remember to leave no trace when you visit. Pack your trash, and pick up after yourself. And if you wander the boardwalks - for goodness sakes stay on them and stay the required distance from any wildlife!"
325,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,"Arlington, VA ",Must See,"This was of course a must-see because it is so famous, but it was more check the box than awe inspiring. It was DEFINITELY worth it, don't get me wrong, but Yellowstone has so many wonders, this is just one of many. There was a geyser to the left that was just as cool but it's not famous because it's not at regular intervals. Am not so jaded that we didn't hang out to see Old Faithful 2 more times that afternoon, am just saying don't limit your experience to just this. Also, while you're waiting there is an ice cream shop in the (beautiful) hotel that has huckleberry ice cream that had a long line but was well worth it for a taste of Wyoming and helped cool us off in the summer sun. Also wear a hat and sun screen, there is no shade by Old Faithful and you need to wait around a while before it goes off, so you can easily get burnt."
326,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018,not available,"Liverpool, UK ",Iconic,"Obviously most people have heard if Old Faithfull and when visiting Gellowstone it's a must but there are much more impressive geysers in the park eg. Steamboat geyser, castle geyser that are more dramatic. It does get very busy here and watch the wind direction...you could get wet! Whilst sitting and waiting you see plumes of smoke from the geysers, hot pools and fume roles behind.....just inviting you to go and explore....which you simply must do. You wont be disappointed"

Meanwhile, by all means should you follow the path around all the geysers and springs, very easy and pleasant.  However, we were very disappointed about the restaurant, food is really poor and tasteless. I really don't understand why they don't hire a real Chef in this amazing place to cook some good meals."

There was a lot of seating and places to view the eruption from, plus lodges nearby with food and drinks. I will say if you are vegetarian it will be hard to find food you like in those lodges. Overall though this is definitely worth seeing when you go to Yellowstone."
347,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Camrose, Canada ",Old Faithful Didn’t disappoint,"Visited on our motorcycle trip through Yellowstone. We arrived and it had just erupted so we missed it. We decided to hang out at the Old Faithful Inn for a bite to eat and a beverage to wait the next eruption. We’re glad that we did because it is much better actually witnessing it, than what you see on YouTube etc. there is no bad area to sit to watch the eruption blow off. You can hear the sounds and all the little activity that happens before the big blowout. I would definitely wait again to see Old Faithful erupt again. Be careful it is very touristy with a lot of people. But they have it well set out for everyone to have a view."
348,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Family, ,Amazing,"It was better than I thought. There are benches and many good viewing areas. After it rains, it appears to go off higher. A must."
349,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, ",Touristy but still fun to see!,"Sometimes going to see the ""touristy things"" are worth it. Yes there are a lot of people and yes you have to park and walk. Yes you may have to sit there for an hour until its next show...but if you are in the area, just do it! It is free (after park entrance fee) and the Visitor's center is also worth checking out, they have great displays and explanations of the thermal activity and what is all going on!"
350,Old_Faithful,Aug 2019 , Family,"Chicago, IL, ",Cool,The science is amazing. The crowds in July are huge. Parking is tough. But there is a lot. But when you see it you are amazed. Pretty awesome.
351,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Solo,"Grand Rapids, MI, ",Must be getting tired,"The view getting there is great. Once you get there a lot of parking information for me was missing. Once you, park the lanes are not identified. There are no signs giving you direction to old faithful. I just missed it so had to wait about a hour. Somebody found online when it would blow next and was within 5 min. They have seating but it is limited. For the geyser itself, I always saw pics of how it shoots straight up in a steam very high. I guess after 200 years of doing it, its getting tired. It sort of sprayed up and about half as high as I thought it would go. Still a neat thing to see. Getting out is another story. Not knowing the area the signs for me were confusing! I made it out and picked the right direction to go!"
352,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,The Netherlands ,"Mooi, maar niet een van de hoogtepunten van Yellowstone!","At day one we never reached the Old Faithfull since there was a roadwork which was not communicated properly and took for ever. So we just turned, like many others, and found another nice highlight.    At day two we were early, 8.50 Am., an jut had to wait 50 minutes.....when we sat down we were one of the first but the crowd rapidly increased.    Than it started.....fist slowly and than a lot of steam and clouds......but not as impressive as expected."
353,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Richardson, TX ",Skip This and Walk the Rest of the Basin,"Old Faithful is not the most impressive geyser in Yellowstone, just the most consistent. It's cool, it's what you associate with the Park, and it may be the onlyl activity that some folks do in a short trip to Yellowstone. Do yourself a favor and beat the crowds by walking the rest of the basin and see some of the fascinating features. If you must see Old Faithful erupt, avoid the crowd and climb up the overlook trail and see it from above."
354,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Fort McMurray, Canada ",Visit,This was a nice site to visit. We visited before 10am and there was still a pretty good crowd there. The place was really getting busy after that. You can bring your dog close to the viewing area but not on the boardwalk. At that hour in the morning the visitor center was also showing an interesting video about the park that they don't show when the crowds get busier.
355,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Solo,"Liverpool, UK, ",Timing,Old Faithful erupts every 75 to 90 minutes. Times are posted inside the Visitors Centre. A must see event when in Yellowstone.
356,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Dudley, UK, ",Spectacular,"You can’t visit Yellowstone National Park, and not go to watch Old Faithful. On arrival go to the visitor centre and ask when it next erupts. They will give you a time window, get a seat about 20 mins or more and settle down. All seats get a great view. Well worth the wait."
357,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Gulf Breeze, FL ",Find different viewpoints,Was able to enjoy 3 eruptions while staying at Old Faithful Inn. There are benches surrounding about 3/4 of the geyser. All offering different viewpoints. Eruptions occur every 90 minutes so about 30 minutes prior people start to pour in. Personally I enjoyed watching from the geyser loop boardwalk which is about 200 yards away and slightly above Old Faithful. Just a bigger perspective. There is an observation point above on the mountain behind which looks like an awesome view. I hiked up there one evening but did not stay for eruption. It’s a tough hike but views would be worth it!!!
358,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples, ,Awesome!,Old Faithful is worth waiting ninety minutes for. The anticipation adds to the fun and everyone enjoys seeing the wonders of nature. We were not disappointed and the park is fantastic.
359,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,SD ,"Nice Experience, stroller friendly!","I recommend finding out when Old Faithful is next scheduled to go off when you get to the site. There is little reception in Yellowstone so I couldn't see from the app when it was next predicted to go off. The visitor center has the current time estimations, wifi, a bathroom, kids' exhibit for you while you wait. There's also several boardwalks around that the kids enjoyed and we were able to push the stroller on. The Old Faithful Inn was pretty crowded. I peaked to see what the price of the buffet was and it was $18 for adults and $9 for kids. With 4 kids, we opted for a picnic lunch instead; with the wait, the kids would have melted. It was a great iconic thing to do!"
360,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples, ,AMAZING!!,"Wow!! So cool. You might have to wait a bit because it goes off about every hour and fifteen or so but there’s lots to do while you fart around waiting. Yummy ice cream. They have a store/gift shop ( Of course...lol), a little art museum, etc. It WAS pretty cool."
361,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"San Jose, CA ",Friendly geiyser,This geyser erupts every 90 minutes or so. The OF inn would project the next potential eruption so that you can plan your visit and be there at that time.
362,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples, ,Glad to see Old Faithful,"Lot's of seating for all. Even those with dogs...it seemed if you stayed back some, all okay.  Old faithful put on a great show as usual. Great amenities in the area."
363,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Elyria, OH ",Still blows,"Check out the estimated time of eruption at different ranger stations throughout the park. Your WiFi or cell service may not work at the site. You can get a great picture from anywhere, don’t worry about the crowds. We watched once from the crowd and the second time from the outdoor porch at the Yellowstone lodge."
364,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Bloomington, IN ",definitely worth braving the crowds to see this,"You're going to have to gird your loins for massive crowds, but hey, it's Old Faithful. Stand in line for ice cream while you're waiting for the next eruption, or hang out on the tempting but surprisingly uncomfortable porch rockers. The nice thing about this place is that everyone has room to spread out, on logs under trees or on benches near the geyser. Despite the people you can also get a decent photo. When it erupts it's really that awesome...nearly 100 feet. Note: this is a natural phenomenon and eruption time is predictable only to within a half hour window, not to the minute. Have some patience with the kids, start a betting game to see who gets the time right, or otherwise chill out. The last major earthquake here apparently messed up the predictability, which is now more like 90 minutes instead of 60 minutes. Oh, and don't be those $%%^@# tourists, who decided on July 22 to pet a bison, who got spooked and tossed a little girl in the air. Stay away from the critters."
365,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Queens, NY ",It's More Than Just Old Faithful,"I came to Old Faithful on a family trip not expecting how much more there is to do here then just watch Old Faithful. Sure, you can see Old Faithful go off approximately every 90 minutes, but this park doesn't end there. There is so much more to see and do.    Go check out the other thermal activity and the other geysers that you may be able to catch while you're here. Also, the thermal pools, such as Morning Glory are something to see.    You can easily spend a few hours here. So I would recommend giving yourself some extra time and don't rush yourself in order to see everything the Old Faithful area has to offer.    Finally, you need to be cautious here. Bison do roam the grounds. Do not pet the Bison! Stay at least 75 feet, 25 yards, away from the Bison, as they will turn on you and charge. This was seen recently and the recommended distance is for your safety, not the Bison!"
366,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Clyde, Texas ",Wondrous,The predictability of this eruption of hot steam from the earth is fascinating and we never tired of the wondrousness of the phenomenon. There are plenty of viewing sites and we had a great view from the Inn where we were staying
367,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Mixed Feelings,"A natural wonder to be sure, but the site, once primitive, is now a congestion of restaurants, hotel, yurts, government offices, restrooms,etc. Asphalt parking lot monstrous. So many people in July (RVs and Tour buses) and kids running everywhere, in and out of other people's photographs, tired babies crying and the list goes on.    Old Faithful gets a 5 simply for its regular eruption from eons past, but the commercialization of the site leaves much to be desired if you are looking for the simplicity of nature."
368,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Salisbury, MD ",Natures Wonder,They call it Old Faithful for a reason. The clock in the massive inn shows you when to expect the show. We watched it 5-6 times and walked the whole loop. Incredible.
369,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Laveno-Mombello, Italy ",Not to be missed,"We were staying at the Old Faithful Inn, thus had the opportunity to experience the magic of Old Faithful a couple of times. Each one is emotional and different, enjoy!"
370,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Minden, IA ",It's a must see!,You have to see old faithful erupt if you're in Yellowstone. Get there early to beat the crowds and you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself!
371,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Peoria, IL, ",Iconic Yellowstone,"When in Yellowstone, I feel like you have to see Old Faithful. To avoid the sometimes suffocating crowds in the summer, watch it erupt early morning or late evening. Stay near Old Faithful if you can (we stayed in the lodge cabins and got to watch it erupt at 1030 PM--so cool!)    Download the Geyser Times app and use that for eruption windows. The NPS predictions only happen when the visitor center is open, but the gazers update predictions 24/7 on the app. Try to see it at dawn and dusk. A great viewing place is the OF Lodge porch--closer than the OF Inn, though watching it from the balcony while drinking a cocktail is pretty cool!"
372,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,Germany ,Nice thing to see,Since it erupts every 90 minutes it is a very reliable geyser to watch. Parking can be hard around eruption time but it is a kind of must thing to do in Yellowstone!
373,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,Malaysia ,The most famous attraction in Yellowstone National Park,"This is the most famous attraction in Yellowstone National Park but, frankly, it was a disappointment for us . The eruption did not last for more than 5 minutes and the height was less than 50 feet."
374,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Peoria, IL ",Incredible and so glad we made it!,We were fortunate enough to have arrived there in time to see this magnificent display of mother nature do what it has been doing for perhaps millions of years. The place was packed and we were all holding our breath to see this occur.
375,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,Illinois ,Must see,Go early and avoid the busses. It is a must see at Yellowstone. Take the time to walk back behind and see the geysers in the area. You will ever forget the first time you get sprayed.
376,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"San Jose, CA ",Old Faithful,Dont miss this one! Its so wonderful and their predictions of geyser timing is impeccable. One of the main attractions in Yellowstone.
377,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Bellevue, NE ",A must see - but not the biggest!,Had a great time - there’s a lot of viewing space and a lot of infrastructure around old faithful. Want to use a real toilet? Here you go. If you watch and then walk the basin trails you should be able to watch it erupt again. If you’re lucky you’ll see Beehive erupt as well.
378,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Medical Lake, WA ",Go early and follow the rules,The Old Faithful area has a lot of parking. But the earlier you get there the better to view the geyser. We got a seat up front about 45 minutes before it was supposed to blow. But then you get all these people who want to set in front of you and hang their feet off the boardwalk. Nobody was successful in doing that in front of my family because well I can’t type the reasons why on here.    Now I’m not sure what was more entertaining to me. The geyser going off or the idiots of Yellowstone jumping off the boardwalk to get a picture of Old Faithful behind them in the background. What a learning experience that would have been for tourist to see somebody fall through the crust into 150 degree plus water.    Remember while in Yellowstone please follow the rules. Jumping off a boardwalk into a thermal area is not recommended.
379,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Loveland, CO ",must see,Was on my bucket list and it did not disappoint. You have to be patient but it is worth the wait.  I would go back again when we visit the area another time.
380,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Huntingdon, PA ",Do it once,"You can’t go to Yellowstone without seeing Old Faithful. But it’s not the most exciting thing there! Make sure you get there, but save time for the real beauties."
381,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples, ,Beautiful,While on a trip to Yellowstone we went to watch the beauty of old faithful send its wonderful jet of hot steam up..its a dependable geyser since it erupts about every hour and it's a true wonder to film and enjoy later at home...I have seen it several times in my lifetime and hope to see it several more...the crowds were great with people from other countries enjoying the sight as well...I reccomend it to anyone planning on taking a trip to Wyoming to go to Yellowstone park but make ur reservations about a year ahead to get a cabin..the western cabins are very nice at old faithful snow lodge.qe stayed there 3 nights..its not cheap but very worth price as it's close to geysers and shops.
382,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Anchorage, AK ",Had to see with my own eyes,"Geysers are very cool to watch. Other geysers you cannot be sure when they will erupt but Old Faithful does so you can plan to see this. Old Faithful is surrounded by a boardwalk and can be quite crowded with people. I stood further back and enjoyed some shade. Nearby you can visit the Old Faithful cafeteria and sit on their porch and watch, just get there early to snag a seat. Old Faithful shot into the sky for at least two minutes. You just can’t really see this anywhere else."
383,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"White Rock, Canada ","Geyser Was Right on Time,Parking is a nightmare.","We only had a day to drive through Yellowstone due to the fact we had our 4 month old Lab with us,so didnt get a chance to see a lot of the park. We arrived at Old Faithful around noon but there was virtually no parking. The signage wasn’t great and we had a small (17’) trailer on the back,as did a lot of other folks,and found the whole parking experience very frustrating. Eventually we,and dozens of others,parked in the tour bus parking. The info center is great at the geysers,lots of good explanations of geo thermal activity. Also be aware that there is ,for at least the second year,major road construction in the Fishing Bridge area,the campground is closed and there are long delays."
384,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Silver Spring, MD ",Can't go to Yellowstone and not see Old Faithful,"One can't go to Yellowstone and not see Old Faithful. That said, don't stop sightseeing your here. There is so much to see more to see in the park.    We very much enjoyed the evening ranger talk on Astronomy. Shout out to Ranger Alice. We learned a lot."
385,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Vadodara, India, ",Charismatic,"It’s The world famous geyser -Old Faithful-out of nearly more than 10000 hydrothermal activities, Old Faithful geyser is the best . Thousands gallons of steam water comes out from the under ground hole/crevice at each eruption making it steam clouds and it is called “faithful “ as at the interval of nearly every 90 minutes , it erupts again and lasts for 5-10 minutes together which gives unexpected , tremendous unimaginable view for the adventurer to see. Magnificent 👌😲"
386,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Overrated,Ive been to Yellowstone twice. Missed the eruption of old faithful both times so very disappointed. So many other pretty geysers and sites to see
387,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"San Rafael, CA ",About what I expected,"It’s hard to not be impressed with nature at work. What I didn’t like was the crowds and the feeling that all this man made stuff was built around it like it’s in a theme park or something. Still, you can’t go to Yellowstone and miss Old Faithful"
388,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Sebastopol, CA, ",Timely and Classic! Watch from different view points.,"If you have the time you might want to watch Old Faithful from a few different locations. If you're taking photos each location has a different view point. LOTS of folks line up along the board walk across from the visitor's center. Your up close for sure, but it can get crowded. You can also get a great view from the deck on the second floor of the lodge. You can enjoy a drink and have a seat. Another nice spot is across from Old Faithful out on the board walks in the geysers area."
389,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Lancaster, PA ",A must see!!,"I saw Old Faithful 23 years ago... it wasn’t as crowded then, but the geyser is just as impressive and reliable. It went off within 1 minute of its scheduled time. It was a pleasure to see again, especially with my kids this time around. Yes, big crowds but that’s to be expected, it is Yellowstone, the largest tourist destination in the USA. To those writing reviews and complaining about the crowds, remember you are part of that crowd you are complaining about. And quite frankly, what were you expecting on a summer time visit?  All in all, a great stop and a must see."
390,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Baton Rouge, LA ",A classic destination,Remember my dad bringing me here when I was 4 or 5. Glad to be able to bring my own children. Nice benches on a clean Tyvek deck in good repair to rest while waiting. Old Faithful erupted within 4 minutes of predicted time!
391,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",Bucket List Item,"I used the Yellowstone app to know when the predicted eruptions would take place. Make sure to get there at least 10-15 minutes before the predicted time, just in case it goes off a little early. Be ready for a lot of people. There were rows of about 15 people deep. Good thing the eruption is high enough you can still see it, even if you are behind rows of people.    This is super amazing to see."
392,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fort Littleton, PA ",Overlook was worth the trip.,We got to old Faithful in time for an eruption almost immediately. I think we waited 10 minutes. Then we spent a little over half an hour walking around the other geysers. We took the trail to soltary and the overlook. We waited about 20 minutes and saw the eruption from the overlook  It was worth the wait. Dont just see Old Faithful erupt once! Its cooler the second time!
393,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fenton, MI ",Amazing,"It's simple amazing that mother nature created such a wonderful sight that is so timely. Make sure to check the eruption times when you arrive at the visitor center or on the Yellowstone app. Things can get crowded, especially close to eruption time so consider having a family member camp out about 30 minutes or so before. The seating is all full sun so maybe take turns holding seats. If you don't care about a front row seat the geysers is large enough to see from the back of the crowd. I'd recommend choosing a seat upwind, otherwise you might get a face full of steam and difficulty seeing the water stream."
394,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Moe, Australia ",One more thing off my Bucket List,"Probably one of the main things I wanted to see in Yellowstone, A truly amazing sight, we saw it erupt 3 times, once while at the Visitors Centre and once from the Back boardwalks and again a the Geyser itself. Its pretty spectacular."
395,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family, ,not very faithful?,missed expected burst as it went off 10 mins early and the next burst was 25 mins late - it was good - very crowded so getting a good view was largely by chance as people squashed in. nice hotel and shop but they get really crowded after the show
396,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Toledo, OH ","I didn’t want to go, and I actually liked it","My sister wanted to see this and I was rolling my eyes and dragging my feet all the way there, but it was kind of fun to see. It goes off roughly about every 90 min but there is a white board in the visitors center that tells you it’s estimated eruption time. If you park at the gas station/ lodge area, we got there 20 minutes before it erupted and still found plenty of parking. I thought this geyser would be like all the rest but the force and height of it makes it impressive."
397,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Rapid City, SD ",Very busy!,Loved the rangers talk on geysers. Very informative and was loud enough! Plus he was from South Dakota!!! What more needs to be said! The board walks were all clean and in working order. The seating was good and it looked like the junior ranger program was an enormous success. The ice cream shop was SEVERELY understaffed. Pretty ridiculous to have one person working ice cream in July!
398,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"New York City, NY ",Geyser Eruption Time,"If you want to see the Geyser eruption, you have to check the eruption time of that day. So you don’t have to wait too long on the bench. You can walk around the loop. If you want a front seat, you have to come at least 30 minutes early to beat the crowd."
399,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Lionville, PA ",A must see!,"A staple visitor spot in YNP. The geyser blew within moments of its guesstimated time. Worth the stopover to see it. Yellowstone Inn right there, restrooms, gift shop and food."
400,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Clarksville, AR ",Crowded but worth the wait,"The crowds can get pretty big before an eruption, but it was worth the hassle for the show, we enjoyed it, and even though there were lots of people here, you could still get a great viewing area when it blows."
401,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Midway, KY ",Very special to see,"It does get crowded, and sometimes I had to cover my ears from the sound, but it was a spectacular view of the old faithful. I loved it."

403,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Pleasant Grove, UT ",Nature at its best,We made sure to visit Old Faithful while we were at Yellowstone National Park. The walkway around the geysers was so awesome. I took the hike to the overlook by myself and loved the views. The hike was easy and worth it.  It was amazing when Old Faithful erupted. The park rangers had predicted when it would erupt and they were dead on.
404,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Loveland, CO, ",Main attraction of Yellowstone,The thermal area has many Geyser and old ye faithful is one of the main attraction. There is a visitor center next to old ye faithful and the ranger will let you know when the Geyser will erupt. It is usually between 80 minutes and 90 minutes. There are benches for your viewing. Worth stopping to see it.
405,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Surrey, Canada ",Extraordinary natural attraction,Worth wait. Erupts about every 90 min. Do wish parents would watch their children better. At least 5 kids were playing in rocks marked quite clearly keep out. Need to pay to get into park. Could spend days exploring. If only have one day definetly go old faithful

408,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Columbia, MD ",Doesn't Disappoint,We were lucky and not only saw Old Faithful but another geyser right next to it erupting at the same time. This is a don't miss attraction in Yellowstone.

Of course, if this is ALL you see of Yellowstone, you are missing out.  But while in Yellowstone, this is a must-see, of course. Check the Inn, visitor's center, or Lodge/Cafeteria for next predicted time and arrive 10 minutes before that time. There is ample seating all around the viewing area.  On our visit, we were fortunate to see Old Faithful five times. In the rain, in the sunset, in the snow, after the snow, and mid-day from a viewing deck. Since it is so easy to see from anywhere around the seating area or upper geyser basin, don't worry about getting to the viewing deck in Old Faithful Inn (the view is somewhat obstructed and not worth it).  Beautiful, different every time, and impressive. I loved it. Also, the visitor center is great and there is shopping, dining, and facilities galore within easy walking distance."

Not too crowded in June. You have to see Old Faithful blow just because it is Old Faithful but it wasn't a highlight for me. Nearby Mystic Falls was my favorite thing to see in the area but does require some hiking.
420,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Oklahoma City, OK ",Staple of Yellowstone,Obviously one of the top stops in Yellowstone. Old Faithful is just that...you are guaranteed to see it erupt. The lodge can give you times to view.
421,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,Duenweg MO ,Wonderous,This geyser is amazing. It can be predicted with a + or - of 10 minutes. The only problem we had was so many people sat on the edge of the concrete and ended up walking on the fragile land surrounding the geyser.
422,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Owatonna, MN ",Must see,You need to see Old Faithful. Parking and area if quite crowded so give plenty of time to get to the site. We had time to like up to the observation point and highly recommend that for a great view and less crowded experience.
423,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,"Redwood City, CA ",Got to see it,First place we went in park spent half a day on Boardwalk’s behind main attraction checking out other geothermal sites. Well set up for tons of people with bleachers and wooden boardwalks through area but very crowded. Huge multiple parking lots remember where you parked. While old Faithful inn is beautiful and historic I would not stay here—whole area too crowded and congested even early in the season.
424,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Mobile, AL ",The primary landmark of Yellowstone,This is a must see thing. While it is not the highest (Steamboat and Grand) or longest lasting event in Yellowstone it is a very big geyser and the fact that it is so predictable is mind boggling. The water and steam erupt 130 feet into the air about every 90 minutes. The crowds are large but there is plenty of room and everyone can get a good view.
425,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Family,"Preston, UK ",A timely eruption,This was a very popular attraction as the car park and crowds showed. We had just missed seeing Old Faithful so had time for an ice cream and meant we had front row seats for the 3:28 eruption. Quite amazing that the forecast was correct within 2 mins!!!
426,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"DeWitt, MI ",Beautiful,It was cold and windy but we waited 45 for Old Faithful to erupt and she didn't let us down. In the meantime was walked the boardwalks and photographed the other picturesque qeyshers and it was truly a beautiful work of Gods art and creativity. Just Beautiful
427,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Des Moines, IA ","Must see on your visit, crowded location","We visited Yellowstone and stayed in the park for two nights. The first night near Old Faithful. The benches fill up about an hour before the estimated time of eruption (ETE), so get there early, and plan around the ETE if you want to see much of it. ETE is every 90 minutes (approx.)"
428,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Walla Walla, WA ",Spectacular!,"I've seen this geyser erupt more times than I can count, but it's always a sight to behold! On my fist day this trip, the eruption I saw was of the punier I've seen. The next day was the best ever!"
429,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019,not available,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Very cool,"This was a great sight, however, slightly disappointing. It’s so crazy to think that our natural world can do something so beautiful but I highly recommend seeing one of the other geysers such as Grand or Castle if you get the chance. Old faithful is very cool but you can get closer to other more exciting ones. The huge crowds at all were also a bit surprising!"
430,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Cape Coral, FL ",The most famous attraction is a must see,"We arrived at Old Faithful luckily with about an hour before it would erupt next. It gave us plenty of time to find a good place to sit and find a good spot for photos. When it erupted, we were not disappointed; in fact, we were surprised that it erupted for as long as it did. This is definitely a must see."
431,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Bellingham, WA ",A must for Yellowstone visitors,A first visit to Yellowstone without going to Old Faithful would be a little bit weird. It would be like not even looking at the Eiffel Tower if you go to Paris. Be prepared for some crowds. Find your viewing spot 10-15 minutes prior to the predicted next eruption. Old Faithful is special to see in-person.
432,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Couples,Maryland ,Pleasantly surprised,"After all the reviews I'm glad we still went here first: our timing was incredible- the geyser erupted as we were walking up to it! From there we walked the loop and saw many other geysers (two more erupted as we walked by so we were so thrilled to see this!) and Morning Glory- a basin at the halfway mark of the loop- small but beautiful. Easy walk- all level but about 2.5 miles round trip, I'm guessing. The Lodge was interesting, too! Beautiful lobby and interesting story- they build it in ten months back in the day! That could never happen today! The Visitor Center was nice, too, but we were too late to see a movie- we always enjoy the National Park films at visitor centers"
433,Old_Faithful,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Southampton, UK, ",Time it correctly,Must check times with ranger staff or boards on display  Well worth the wait to see erupt . Saw it twice can be effective by the wind as it rises . Lots of places to see it including seating
434,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Family,"Atlanta, GA, ",More than just Old Faithful!,"Faithfully erupted for us around the time predicted. With the beautiful historic inn on site this is a great place to stop for gas with easy parking & great food options in the hotel. Recommend going on the earlier side so you can see Old Faithful, eat at the breakfast buffet, & enjoy the main area & gift  shops before the tour buses start appearing! There is a lot of spectacular things to see around this area so don't go just to see Old Faithful."
435,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Arnold, MD ",Bucket List Item,Not everyday can one observe Old Faithful in action-what a crowd pleaser. It performed on schedule and provided and very nice show. An unusual opportunity in the states and well worth the visit
436,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples, ,Great to see Old Faithful in person!,We enjoyed having the opportunity to see Old Faithful erupt 6-7 times while staying at the Old Faithful Inn. Quite a interesting and enjoyable site to see. Wish the seating was a little more friendly for elderly or people with mobility issues.
437,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,Pennsylvania ,"Cool, but not as spectacular as the surrounding area","Old faithful is famous for being predictable - the geyser itself is neat but not the best in the park (I would rather see Grand or Castle again, both of which are nearby). But you HAVE to do old faithful just because of its fame.    There are a lot of cool pools nearby in the basin. This was my favorite area to walk around in the park. And there is food and a visitors center, and cell service! (Verizon). But old faithful itself, with the crowds and the distance you have to keep, was only 'very cool' not 'awesome' to me"
438,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples, ,Old Faithful did not disappoint,"Not knowing how long it takes Old Faithful to blow, we waited about 30 minutes before googling predicted eruption times. Turns out the geyser is now erupting every 35-120 minutes, not as regularly as in the past. We ended up waiting about 45 minutes in the end. There are a few benches up front you can sit on, but will have to get there early (as in right after an eruption) because they fill up fast. We chose to stand back in the shady trees area where there are plenty of fallen logs and trees around to sit on if you'd like. We also sat on a makeshift teeter totter for a bit which was entertaining while we waited.    When she did errupt, Old Faithful did not disappoint. It was pretty incredible how high the water shot into the air and it lasted much longer than we expected. We ended up leaving even as it was still erupting to beat the crowd who then rushed to the bathrooms and gift shop."
439,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Friends,"San Diego, CA ",Old Faithful never disappoints....sometimes a Gurggle other times Whoosh and Up Up Up,"Check the times on the NPS website or in the visitors area for the next eruption. usually 100 minutes between each eruption but not exactly close though. Super interesting and all the trails around the Old Faithful will STILL get you a GREAT view of the eruption and sometimes even better than just sitting on the benches, so go and walk around!"
440,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Fremont, CA ",Timing is the key,"This geyser erupts every 75 to 90 mins. The timings are put up in the visitor center and also the lodges. Parking is ample and people enter and leave after each eruption. Since this is the only geyser which is so predictable, it is most visited. Gets absolutely packed during afternoons. Incase you are travelling in your own, try and visit before 9 am or after 6pm. You will enjoy this place much more. The visitor center is informative and the bakes in the cafe are yummy. Don't miss this one"
441,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Solo,"Portsmouth, VA ",Waited a Lifetime,I had never seen a geyser. Old Faithful was true to its namesake and came exactly when predicted. I had a front row seat and foreign nationals impolitely got in front of me. I finally convinced them to sit down before the event. It was worth the wait.
442,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018,not available,"Vancouver, WA ",Wowser!,"The anticipation is the eruption, visiting with people from all over the world.....then it goes off and the crowd roars! Totally fun!"
443,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Lewes, UK ",It’s just steam,"This didn’t really impress as much as other areas in this national park. However, it is a must-see. Be prepared to queue to park your car. Large tourist shop and cafe."
444,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Indialantic, FL, ",Stinky but beautiful,"If you have the chance to see this park, please don’t hesitate, it is absolutely beautiful and there is so much to see, the geysers are stinky but the water colors are gorgeous"
445,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Dayton, OH ",Meh,"I’m not sure what everyone is so excited about, there are a lot of geysers in the park and this one isn’t the largest, just the most regular. The visitor center was great and the rangers were helpful but it isn’t worth waiting for an hour like we did. If you really need to go be sure to visit in the late afternoon or evening to beat the crowd, but remember that the visitor center closes  at 8."
446,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Iola, KS ",I can say I went.,"I was not impressed at all. There are so many people waiting, which I expected. There are so many better geysers in Yellowstone. I'm glad I went just to say that I've seen it. If I ever return to Yellowstone I will not visit Old Faithful again, once was enough for me."
447,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"LaBelle, FL ",It Blows!,"My title is meant in a funny way. Old Faithful went off and left us all in awe. If you have kids go into the main visitors center and get them singed up in the junior ranger program (youngest kids can be 4 or 3.5) They give them an little oath and booklet for them to work on.  Old Faithful does go off every 45 minutes or so, so the book gives them something to do.    I will caution you that this area is PACKED with people. There is a walkway around the entire thermal area with more geysers that can go off. You can see approximate times in the Visitor Center.    There is seating around Old Faithful, if you cannot grab a seat on a bench theres enough area to sit at the brink of the boardwalk. Please be careful to not step off of it onto the thermal area. (I mean keep our parks healthy for others)    The last bit of caution I can give you is PEOPLE ARE SOOO RUDE. We had to deal with several folks from out of the country (literal bus loads of them) who would walk right in front of me while I was taking photos wit a large camera and not an apology or a screw off from them. They also decided that they could walk wherever and would ignore the signs. Infuriating people. Luckily, here a park ranger screamed at them to get back in line."
448,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Highbridge, UK ",Must see,"Although it's a must see if you are ever in the area, if you do just miss it and have to wait it can be a long time, we had to wait an hour and 45 minutes for an event that took minutes to complete."
449,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Green Bay, WI ",Underwhelming....,"Excited to see Old Faithful. While waiting to see old faithful another geyser went off, “beehive” this geyser was awesome. Then it was old faithfuls time to blow. It was very disappointing and way overrrated."
450,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples, ,Must see,This is on every coach trip in the region so expect crowds ! The walk around the geysers in this area is fantastic and a must do activity
451,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Charlotte, NC, ","It's touristy and predictable, but good for kids","The kids really wanted to see a geyser, so this one was the ticket. It's predictable, and if you have the yellowstone app, you can see when it will erupt, within about 10 minutes of the actual time. We opted to sit on the side viewing area, as the front was uber crowded, which turned out to be fine. We didn't get wet sitting there which was good. It erupted on the earlier side of the schedule, but the kids enjoyed seeing it."
452,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Indianapolis, IN ",Old Faithful,"My personal opinion, not worth the wait or the crowd. If you are going to be there you might as well go, but there are other geysers in the area and less crowded"
453,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Port Orchard, WA ",Cooler Than Expected,"This turned out to be such a wonderful attraction. The Old Faithful geyser itself is fairly cool, but there is also a massive field of geysers that can be monitored from the main viewing area. In fact, there is a pretty nice boardwalk that allows you to wander around amongst them. Very trippy. The nice thing about the immediate Old Faithful geyser is that there are a couple of hundred yards worth of benches that form a massive half moon viewing area around it, along with lots of standing room. At least it seems like a lot of room except when the tour busses start rolling in and the visitors who drive in from the nearby west entrance arrive. Our first night there, we were fortunate enough to find a seat because we checked into the Snow Lodge after most of these folks departed. Plenty of parking nearby because it was after the dinner hour. That night we didn't check the clock that estimates the eruptions (posted in al 3 lodges plus visitors center), but it was fun sitting there for a half-hour watching the thing fume and spout and act as though it might blow any minute. Many of its brother and sister geysers were spouting in the distance, some quiet impressively, and the mountains looked beautiful as the sun lowered. When the thing blew, it was pretty cool, and because there was not much wind, the plume blew almost straight up again and again for somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes. A blast, literally. We enjoyed staying at the Old Faithful Snow Lodge, even though, unlike the other 2 inns, it doesn't sit adjacent to the geyser. But that turned out to be good because we always had a place to park and we enjoyed some unexpected shows whenever we glanced out our window. In fact, the very first morning, the whole area was just a mass of steam-filled clouds - the whole family of geysers must have conspired to go off at once. We wandered down to Old Faithful later in the afternoon/early evening, and I will also it was a zoo trying to find a spot to view with the gazillion tourists surrounding it & cars flying around the parking lot in dangerous desperation. This time we used the time clock estimate at the hotel, so we didn't have to hang around too long before the big boy blew. Still fun, but much better after the crowds abate. Thus, early morning or late evening are best. Which means you kind of have to be staying at one of the nearby lodges or camps, or get through the west gate pretty dang early or stay pretty doggone late. Anyway, this is one of the best areas of the park because there are plenty of other geyser fields to visit as well as the main attraction."
454,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Pensacola, FL, ",Might as Well See it; it's part of the adventure,"The problem with Old Faithful is that EVERYONE wants to see it, so there are always crowds. If you can, schedule one night in the area - things quiet down after all the buses leave, and Old Faithful Continues to erupt. They post the time of the next eruption in the Old Faithful Inn, and it is accurate, most of the time, within ten minutes. You came all this way; you really need to see Old Faithful erupt at least once."
455,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Pagosa Springs, CO ",Yellowstone 2019,"Old Faithful lived up to it’s name on this trip as it has on every trip I’ve made to Yellowstone. The biggest thrill came when a geyser down valley went off at the same time. In fact I saw more geysers go off on this trip than ever before - the reason was an app (free) that gave the approximate times for each geyser in the park that erupts on a fairly regular basis. We also took advantage of a late afternoon eruption to have a drink on the second floor outdoor deck with 100 of other hedonists. The bar was very convenient, and there’s a coffee bar as well for other times of the day. Enjoy!"
456,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",Watch timing,There are several sources to keep track of the eruptions and it's always a good idea to plan ahead for 2 or 3 different times. You never know how long it's going to take to get there as possible the Bison will be crossing the road at the same time and create a huge traffic jam...which is super exciting!    The geyser itself was great to see. Plan time to park and walk to the viewing area.
457,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018 , Family,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH ",Iconic landmark but.....,and while it was cool to see it was a little underwhelming. I thought there were much more interesting geysers in the park than this one. BUT it is Old Faithful so you have to see it no matter what. I also agree to get there early or parking will be an issue. There are also a lot of trails nearby to see plenty of other geysers and formations. Plan on spending at least a half a day in the area. And make sure you go into the Old Faithful Lodge - it's amazing! There is also a really nice information center/museum and places to eat there as well.
458,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Williamsburg, VA, ",Famous geyser,"Old Faithful lives up to its name and goes off with extreme regularity. You can count on it with a 10 minute window either way. The area where it is located is very busy and crowded. If you want a seat on the benches in the viewing area, go about 15-20 minutes early.    I have to say that while the eruption of the geyser was nice, it wasn’t quite as spectacular as I thought it would be. Maybe my expectations were too high. Anyway, it was still worth seeing and would do it again."
459,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Berlin, CT ",A site to behold.,"I have never seen a geyser, this is the one to see. This one is a site to behold. It lives up to it's legend. Gotta see it erupt."
460,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Bryant, AR ",It’s Old Faithful!,"This geyser basin was very entertaining. I was worried the kids would get bored, but they had a great time walking around and seeing all the different thermal features. There were also several bison nearby."
461,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Friends,"Ironwood, MI ",Old Faithful,Very timely. Huge crowds. An interesting stop while in Yellowstone but not as adventurous as others.
462,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Weston super Mare, UK ",Got to do it!!,"In the 4 hours we were in this area, I managed to see Old Faithful erupt 3 times. Just beautiful and much quieter than I expected. Plenty of room to sit and watch. Though we were early in the season."
463,Old_Faithful,May 2019,not available,"Plano, TX ",My Wife was enchanted,"Beverly has only heard about Old Faithful. And it had bee 55 years since I had been to Yellowstone.  Even though we saw old faithful while it was snowing, she was enchanted."
464,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Friends,"Aiken, SC ",A Sight To Behold,"We drove the loop through Yellowstone entering at West Yellowstone , MT. I had read about and studied about Old Faithful in school but seeing it erupt was beyond my wildest imagination. We were able to get a few photos but they don't reflect the magnificence of it. It is well worth the trip."
465,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Idaho Falls, ID ",Awesome,"There is a huge boardwalk surrounding the geyser with benches for seating (not nearly enough seating area as there were upwards of 1000 people watching when we observed on 3pm Sat in June). There are also many vantage points other than the boardwalk area such as inside the visitors center, trails around the geyser, and if you get the right room you can see from your hotel room inside the Old Faithful Inn.  There is a plus/minus 10 min approximated time that the park rangers give so you can make sure to see the geyser go off. If you want a seat on a bench outside. I’d suggest being there 25 mins before that time if it’s a busy day in the park. If you just missed the show, I’d suggest going through the visitors center exhibit as well as going inside the Inn. If you take your time that should burn just enough time off the clock to still get a good vantage point of the geyser from the boardwalk."
466,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Haines City, FL ",Just amazing!,"You’ve seen Old Faithful a hundred times in movies and pictures, but to see it first hand is stunning. Don’t miss the grounds around the area as well. Make sure you take the boardwalk out to the additional geysers in the area...not to be missed! We found this area to be the most crowded in Yellowstone, which was kind of a drawback. Suggest going early in the day and getting out before the craziness of midday. Beautiful visitor center and plenty of gift shops."
467,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Washington DC, DC ",Right on time - get there early,"Yes, it spouts on schedule, couldn't believe it! We made the trek out to Old Faithful from Bozeman (loooong drive) before dark. It started to snow/sleet at the end of May around 4pm and it rains a lot - bring an umbrella. Was a geyser and kinda cool. To be honest, we like the Artist Paintpots better for the spouts, but was cool to see.    It does help to get there early as this is one of the most touted 'to-be' places in Yellowstone. The roads and the place gets crowded. But it's viewable even with a lot of people. We do want to thank the gentleman who shared his umbrella as it snowed and rained at 30 degrees- thankful for the kindess of strangers :)"
468,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Caputh, UK ",It’s not just about Old Faithfull!,"This place is stupendous. Best late afternoon/evening when the colours are best and light coming up the valley almost silhouettes some of the geysers. The main surprise for us was that while Old F lasts maybe five minutes, the Castle Geyser just down the valley goes on for 45 minutes or more. Some big attractions sometimes don’t meet the hype - no danger of that here!"
469,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018 , Family,"Southside Place, TX ",Looks like a white cider cone,"This is a great geyser! I especially liked its shape, like a flat version of Paricutin. I nearly fell off the walkway into the hot springs while filming, though, so keep an eye on your feet!"
470,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Belfast, UK ",Amazing !!,"Without a doubt one of the most memorable experience of my life, outstanding natural beauty.    Tip :- try to arrive approx one hour before an expected eruption to get a good veiwing position. Note - the late comers will try to elbow and slide there way forward and upstruct your view...a polite firm "" sorry Ive been queing here, please find another position that is not instructing my view"""
471,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Brea, CA ",Doesn’t Disappoint!,"Old Faithful is Yellowstone’s most popular attraction, and it doesn’t disappoint. The iconic geyser is absolutely beautiful, and takes wonderful photos. Plenty of viewing space, and there is even a half mile hike to a scenic overlook of the geyser if you are so inclined! Nothing like it! A must see at Yellowstone!"
472,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Elyria, OH ","Interesting, but not what I expected","We visited in early May which was a good time to go to avoid the summer crowds. This was not a highlight of our trip, but it is worth a stop."
473,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Ventura County, USA ",Old Faithful is a geyser you can count on to erupt about every 90 minutes.,"The visitor center and lobby of Old Faithful Inn have information about the next expected eruption. I saw people at night sitting on the outside, front porch of the second story of the Old Faithful Inn to watch. I personally think the closer the better so you can hear it, feel it, and watch it. Pretty exciting introduction to the park."
474,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"San Mateo, CA ",Everything I had heard and more,"I have been wanting to go to Yellowstone for ages. We fin ally agreed on a date and went in May, to avoid the summer crowds. Well, we got snow instead but since it was the end of the season, just a little snow and cold. The Old Faithful Inn was rustic, memorable and everything an iconic lodge should be. It also offered several choices for dining, including a smack area if you just did not feel like eating. Don't miss the huckleberry ice cream.. unusual and very tasty!"
475,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Friends,"Oahu, HI ","To get a real feel for this amazing location, walk about to see other geysers!","Everyone comes to Yellowstone to see Old Faithful but there are many other geysers in the basin. Some go off regularly and some less frequently. If you just see Old Faithful, my rating is a four but to see more gets a five+    We were fortunate to see three other geysers perform. Most recommended is Grand Geyser, which is higher than Old Faithful. I happen to love rainbows. When we got to, Riverside Geyser, which is reliable and whose eruption lasts about 20 minutes, the sun was at just the right angle to create rainbows in the geyser.    We ended our walk by going up Geyser Hill, and there were new little geysers, one so new it was not yet named."
476,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Family,"Birmingham, AL ",See it twice!!!,I would go early because of crowds. Be sure to see it a second time because it may not go off as good as the first time.
477,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Family,"West Bend, WI ",Too Hyped,While OF is quite predictable in its timing it isn't the best to see. There are far more active geysers and thermal sites - most of which is the Grand Prismatic. Its just one of the iconic thing TO see but not the best. Area is also way to congested.
478,Old_Faithful,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Keizer, OR ",Old Faithful and Its Neighbors,"Take the time to wander along the paths surrounding Old Faithful. Dozens of smaller geysers, sulphuric springs and fumaroles. Easy hike on groomed trails."
479,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Friends,"Bridgeton, NJ ",Always great to see,"This is another must see when visiting Yellowstone. Here’s a helpful tip for first timers. When you have a cell phone signal check an internet website that tracks the times that Old Faithful erupts, and gives you a prediction of a time window of when the next one will be. This is especially helpful if you visit at a time when the visitor center is closed."
480,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Family,"Crossville, TN ",It's Iconic,Iconic and reliable. Check around and you can easily spot the various spots that list the predicted erruption times. Arrive early and stay after to capture the full happening.
481,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Troy, TX ","It’s really cool, but...","Here is the deal about Old faithful, it is what it is. A hole in the ground that you cannot get very close to because it spews hot water and steam 110 feet into the air. It’s cool but once you have seen it you are like, OK... I’ve seen it. It erupts about every 90 minutes but allow 10-20 minutes of give to that. Ours went 16 minutes past the predicted time. Everyone should see it true. But once you have, in my opinion, you can move on."
482,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Clayton, NC ",It was worth seeing one time,"Maybe because we've heard about it all our lives, it was not as wow as I expected and my husband agreed. We found Turban and Vent much more impressive."
483,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018 , Family,"North Myrtle Beach, SC ",Must See!,"You have to take your time and just plan to be in the area for a while. While they post how active Old Faithful is, it is still an act of nature and you can not set your watch by it. Be patient and just have a seat and wait for a spectacular show"
484,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"London, UK ",Try and see it from the hill behind,A bucket list location - try to see it from the hill behind for the best perspective. And don’t rush your own time.
485,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Family,"Bluffton, SC ",Going to YellowStone's West Entrance? - Of course you will go see it,"Depending on the time of the year the traffic going to this famous site can be a real bear...all puns intended. But overall it's worth spending the time sitting in your car to get there. The reason for the slow drive is everyone stopping to take pictures of the bison, which can be as far away as a 1/2 mile, just off the edge of the road or on the road entirely stopping traffic. But then again, that's why you really came to Yellowstone in the first place!    The area around the geyser is well set up for viewing and there is the hotel with it's great interior architecture on display, the restaurants inside to take a few moments to get off your feet and of course the gift shop too.    The geyser erupts approximately every 73 minutes or so and is pretty much on time plus or minus 10 minutes. It didn't spout as high as I imagined but it is still pretty impressive. Expect a lot of crowds at the fence surrounding the geyser. I recommend standing back and uphill a bit for the best pictures if you can't get right up to the fence."
486,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples, ,Old Faithful Geiser,"We never understood till we saw the Old Faithful for ourselves that it actually goes off exactly every 90 minutes, pretty amazing. We were more impressed with the turquoise pool in the park and the buffalo that calmly walked down the middle of the road, causing drivers to just wait patiently for him to amble off the street for us to drive! Of course the park is so huge you could never see the whole thing ,but it's pretty amazing!"
487,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Solo,"Goleta, CA ","A Natural Wonder Worthy of the Overused Adjective ""Iconic""","I was able to visit Yellowstone for one day during my recent trip to Jackson Hole and Grand Teton. The drive is roughly 75 miles from Jackson to the south entrance of Yellowstone, and then another 25 miles to one of its signature attractions, Old Faithful. The drive within Yellowstone to Old Faithful is also fabulous as you cross the Continental Divide several times at an elevation approaching 9000 feet.    The site of Old Faithful has been exceptionally well organized by the Park Service to accommodate the crowds in high season. It is much better to visit outside of summer for easier parking and fewer crowds. The Old Faithful Lodge and the Park Service Education Center surround the main attraction.    The eruption is not precisely timed, and so waiting for up to 75 minutes is possible. I arrived between eruptions such that I waited only 30 minutes. The amphitheater bench seating and the many families as well as international visitors create an excitement all its own, as we wait for Mother Nature's show to begin. There is a quiet reverence of anticipation for what is about to begin. There is a steady plume of steam even before eruptions, and even a few false spurts, but the eruption itself, which lasts 1-1/2 to 2 minutes, is so iconic and so highly anticipated that everyone watching feels a sense of amazement and unity. It is an experience not to be missed.    There are other geysers in Yellowstone, and many have more frequent or equally impressive eruptions, but Old Faithful has earned its unique place in the pantheon of natural wonders."
488,Old_Faithful,May 2019 , Couples,"Rancho Mirage, CA ",Old Faithful,"Our room was a few hundred yards away and we were able to watch from our bed. Usually erupts at least once per hour, and they can usually accurately predict the eruptions within +/- 10 minutes, so it is by far the best geyser to see."

And now it was my turn to see it in real life. I made 2 trips in a 2 week span to visit the park. And each visit was different but ""Old Faithful"" still as majestic. This old geyser goes off every 1hr-20mins (give or take 10 minutes) so have your camera ready to take that great shot. Old Faithful can be photographed from different angles in the area just find the view that works for you. I chose 4 different positions in the area. Enjoy, your visit."

It’s worth the wait and fighting the crowds in Sumer. Just a warning if the park is crowded there is no parking for large vehicles and vehicles pulling trailers.

The spout of steam and water extends to around 100 feet into the air. It is very impressive to see mother nature put on such a magnificent show. You won’t be disappointed.  There are good souvenir shops and cafes catering for the crowds. We were their early in the season so didn’t experience the crush of the crowds. Heaps of parking but probably fills up quickly in the high season. I would recommend you go early in the day to beat the crowd.  It’s a must see, you are bound to enjoy the experience."

Unfortunately it has just gone off before we got there so we had to wait to the next time. It's amazing but they predict when it will go off again within + or - 10 minutes, they were fairly accurate. Was very glad I got to see it. Also there are a lot of other geysers to see in the park."

Hitting one of the greatest national parks, seeing thermal geysers, and some of the greatest vistas in North America.    We got our National Park Passport there 10 years ago and have been back every year.    Once you get to the parking lot check the signs for the next eruption and then dine at one of the many spots that views Old Faithful. Stop into the new visitors center, buy souvenir or two, and bring a sweat shirt since the weather can change in an instant.    Bring your camera, and check into the web cams before you come and then tell loved ones when you get there for an extra special memory.    Plan an hour or two for this stop and take the board walk as well.    Enjoy."

As you stand waiting to see the geyser for the first time, there is an anticipation that builds up inside of you. When the geyser erupts, you hear the sound and see the water cascading into the sky and falling back to the ground. It is wonderful that God created something so amazing for mankind to enjoy. Have your camera ready to photograph and video. Seeing Old Faithful was something on our bucket list that now has been completed."
506,Old_Faithful,Apr 2019 , Family,"Lausanne, Switzerland ",Visit a legend,This is the place you see everywhere in pictures. They did a good job to protect the site and give room for everyone to look at it.    It is disappointing if you don’t stay for the geyser to be active. Otherwise there is not much to see . You can find forecast in the web when the geyser will erupt
507,Old_Faithful,Feb 2019 , Friends,"Whakatane, New Zealand ",Bucket list,"Definitely a must do. But lots of other activities to check out too, old faithful goes off every 90 mins whereas the other geysers have more a surprise factor to them."
508,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Moscow, Russia, ",old faithful,"This spring has the name old faithful because it is fairly easy for the park to predict when it is going to erupt. There are benches all around, they're full when an eruption is coming soon."

510,Old_Faithful,Mar 2019 , Couples, ,Beauty,"We had the privilege of seeing some of the most beautiful places in nature. Old Faithful is an incredible display of beauty and majesty. Being able to be there during the eruption on a cold and clear winter day was a treat. Going in the winter with there being fewer people was nice, too. I’d recommend it."

Don’t miss it."
515,Old_Faithful,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Las Vegas, NV ",Winter,Cold crisp air and hot steam with brilliant blue skies equals one must see event. Old Faithful is magnificent just because it is an incredible interesting phenomenon. But add the extra feature of winter and it gains a favorite point from this traveler.
516,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Fort Collins, CO ",Iconic location (and crowds),"We stayed at the Old Faithful Inn, which proved fortuitous for viewing this feature.    Everyone in the park wants to see Old Faithful and the crowds were rediculous at virtually all times of day. Best time to see her is after dinner if you want a little personal space.    A walk around the Geyser Basin is highly recommended and rewarding."
517,Old_Faithful,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Slidell, LA ",She was a little late!,"We visited with a tour group and arrived about 10 minutes before the predicted eruption, but Old Faithful’s intervals are stretching and she blew about 5-10 minutes later than expected.    Due to the Government shutdown, the visitor center was closed. :(    We saw bison from the boardwalk too"
518,Old_Faithful,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Las Vegas, NV, ",Must see,Visited Old Faithful today with friends. The geyser goes off about every 90 minutes.  I have seen it in the summer and now in the winter. The winter is a lot less crowded.

520,Old_Faithful,Dec 2018 , Family, ,Cold Weather Viewing,"It was a cold day in December - the day after Christmas, so there were not many visitors to the park. The Government was shut down, but the tours that run from Jackson still had access to the park. We saw the geyser blow, but because of the cold what we saw was mostly steam. It was still an awesome sight."
521,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"St Helens, UK ",It Lives up to Expectations,We were lucky it performed for us within 5 minutes of arriving and we saw it twice more from a distance as we toured the 6 miles of boardwalks. If you are mobile it is well worth spending a few hours here. We spent 6 hours and saw 6 geysers go off.
522,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA ",A little older and not quite so faithful!,"Still not to be missed, but was running on a hour and twelve minute schedule.

523,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018,not available,"atlanta, georgia, usa ",Truely a classic landmark in our country,"This consistent geyser is a true delight to behold. The park does a great job of keeping everyone informed as to when the next likelihood the geyser will go off, and it is quite accurate. It is a very relaxing experience and the crowds are plentiful but there is plenty of seating with no bad views. Defintely a MUST See in the park."
524,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018,not available,"Lakeville, MN ",Amazing!,We drove from California to Minnesota. It's in my bucket list to visit yellow stone. The scenery was so beautiful but driving in the dark was challenging and it snowed to. Hoping to go back and spend more time in the area.
525,Old_Faithful,Jun 2018 , Family,"Columbus, OH, ",Everyone Gets to See Geyser,This geyser is not the biggest or the most spectacular in the park. This is just one of the more predictable geysers. It is probably the most famous in the world. The crowd's on this one is big. From the parking lot it is about 500-800ft away. This geyser as a relatively small eruption window compared to others which makes it nicer.
526,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Santa Rosa, CA ",Old Faithful,"Don't come to Yellowstone without seeing this wonder of nature. The geyser is so unique and gorgeous. Make the time to park and wait around until it erupts. Make more time and take the fairly easy hikes all around this geyser. Paths signs/directions are easy to follow and there is so much more to see just in that area!! And usually parking is available at this location. Don't miss it! So you can spend more time, just in this area of the park and see amazing formations that are not in other areas."
527,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Business,"Woodstock, VA ",What a wonder of nature,This was truly a unique experience. We were lucky to see two eruptions and the first was was long... the second time was short. Very neat!
528,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family, ,Great to watch!!,"There are so many amazing attractions in Yellowstone, but this is unique and truly showcase the immense power of mother earth. This geyser is so high and it erupts at a predictable frequency. There are plenty of parking space and lots of sitting area around the geyser. We did not go to visitor center, but we directly went to gift shop and they have displayed the next estimated time of eruption. There some food shops in that building as well. I am sure you will be impressed by this geyser."
529,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Sheffield, UK ",Must see,"On your trip to Yellowstone make sure you take in a visit to the Old Faithful geyser, the most famous one in the park. Not only is it the most famous geyser in the park it is the most predictable. The national parks publish estimated activity times for the geysers and with Old Faithful, I seem to remember, it was about every 90 minutes, + or - 10 minutes. The geyser itself has seating available and a couple of hundred yards behind the seating is car parking, toilets, gift shop, cafe etc so they do cater for lots of visitors. We visited early in October and it was very manageable, visitor wise. I am willing to bet that it gets really busy here in the height of the summer, however, you can’t really go to Yellowstone without visiting this geyser."

Yellowstone is certainly prepared for the large number of people who flock to see it. The parking lot is large and easy to navigate - we had no problem parking. Sidewalks lead around to the various buildings and the circular area around the geyser itself. Signage is good. Bathrooms available. There is a place to grab flatbread pizzas (we went in October - a lot of food and vendor places were shut down for the season). The flatbread was around $10 and was eh. The souvenir shop is extensive - lots of bargains if you look for the clearance shelving. We found mugs that were beautiful and only 99 cents as opposed to the $15 mugs that were just a few feet away. Old Faithful is always on time - duh - and even though you know about when it will go off (the crowd educates each other as new people join the group to wait), the suspense is still intriguing. It sputters and has a few bursts before the big one. Pretty cool to see for sure!!"
537,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Santa Ana, CA, ",So Dependable and Impressive Geyser,"As the name suggests, Old Faithful erupts on a pretty regular schedule and is impressive compared to all the other geysers.

We visited Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park in mid-October and enjoyed sunny, warm days and cool nights for one week. The other advantage of an early October visit is that the summer crowds have left. We entered through the West Yellowstone Gate -- which closes November 1st. For all practical reasons, October is the last month in the year to visit. Yellowstone is an amazing, unique National Park. It is not only the first established NP, it is home to one of the world's largest calderas with over 10,000 thermal features and more than 300 geysers. There are only 900 geysers in the world! If you have not yet visited Yellowstone...put it at the top of your bucket list. You will not be disappointed!"
540,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Orange County, CA ",Erupted right at the projected time!,Old Faithful didn't disappoint! Just as we expected and everyone patiently waited on the boardwalk! She erupted with a few small gurgles and the crowd oohed and awed and then she gave her almost 2 minutes of geysering!
541,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Tomball, TX ",Watching Old Faithful,Absolutely wonderful. Not crowded in October and sat and saw the eruption first hand. We were right in front and it is amazing to watch as it prepares to erupt and then it suddenly goes off. Lots of fun and very pretty.
542,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Cape Town, South Africa ",Average,"We waited patiently for the geyser to erupt but saw more mist than anything else. I definitely expected a lot more and had a much better time at surrounding geysers. Perhaps it was just a less impressive eruption than at other times but as you wait for quite some time, we decided to explore the other geysers instead of watching it again."
543,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Cleveland, OH ",Very Nice...can't imagine if it was in season!,"This in and of itself is a fantastic site. Reading and observing it is incredible. A person needs to see this at least once in their life. The downside...even in off season, piles of people...and some cultures are just down right rude. Pushing, ignoring signage to get their selfies and so on...I cannot imagine during peak season."
544,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Kansas City, MO, ",Iconic site!,There’s a reason this geyser is world famous. It’s stunning eruptions occur every 65-70 minutes. There are benches to sit on while waiting for the next viewing. If you arrive quite early there are shops and toilets within a short walking distance from the geyser. It is gorgeous at all times of day. We stopped three different times during our week here. We never get tired of watching Old Faithful.
545,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Family,"Santaquin, UT ",One of the iconic highlights,"Old faithful is one of the most well known places in Yellowstone.

547,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,"Charlotte, NC ",Impressive Natural Display - Prepare for a large crowd,"The viewing area for Old Faithful is a good distance away and it is recommended to get to the seating well in advance of the projected start time as the seats fill up quickly. The same approach would be wise when planning your day, there was a significant difference in the crowd for the first eruption and the second. The movies and information displays in the visitor center were interesting. Also, the geyser did go off 30 minutes ahead of their estimate!    The boardwalks around the geysers make for easy walking. We did encounter a bison crossing the boardwalk right in front of us so be careful!"

550,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"London, UK ",Allow a couple of hours,"Old Faithful is fantastic to see. And is indeed very faithful (around every 4hr +/- 10min). It feels like one on the ‘must see’ of Yellowstone (hence the bus tours dropping of for 30min visit). The gift shop is very pleasant (albeit the same stuff as every Yellowstone gift-shop) and facilities quite good.  However, if you only stay to see Old Faithful you will have missed the wonder of the area. As well as OF there is a path of other mud-pools, geysers and hot springs."
551,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Conway, SC ",WHAT A THRILL,We didn't have to wait too long to see one of the wonders of the world. In fine fashion it started out small and then erupted into a full force of water. Awesome.

Look for predicted spouting times inside the Old Faithful Inn Lobby or the Visitor's Center. You can tell just by seeing the crowds line up. For a better view - go to the second floor inside the Inn to the outdoor balcony seating area.
554,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Shelby, MI ",Impressive but a little disappointing,All my life I wanted to see Old Faithful up close. We were there for the eruption. It is almost better to see it from a little further away to get the scope of the Geyser. The crowds are heavy at any time. After we watched the eruption we took the Geyser walk and saw Castle Geyser erupt. I found it more impressive than Old Faithful.
555,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Family,"Boise, ID ",Great hikes and visitors center,"Great job of having available paths, hikes, visitors center. Not the old Inn closes by 7th so plan accordingly. That’s a must see."

There is a large viewing area with an entire village next to the geyser. There are signs at the visitors center that give an estimate of when the geyser will next erupt. It can be very crowded here, so allow some time to find your way around the site & get a good seat for the next eruption."
557,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",Who hasn't been to Old Faithful?,"My parents took us on a trip to Yellowstone National Park so many years ago, I can't remember when. But I do recall that we stayed in a cabin not far from the Old Faithful Inn and Old Faithful geyser. We walked from our cabin to Old Faithful early in the morning and stayed for hours, waiting breathlessly for each eruption. Today, it remains an awesome sight. Old Faithful is a cone geyser that has a highly predictable geothermal feature, erupting every 44 to 125 minutes since 2000. It isn't the tallest or largest geyser in Yellowstone National Park. Those titles belong to the less predictable Steamboat Geyser. But Old Faithful was the first geyser in the park to receive a name, during the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition in 1870. It was the first geyser that Henry D. Washburn saw. At one time, it was used as a laundry. Eruptions can shoot 3,700 to 8,400 gallons of boiling water to a height of 106 to 185 feet lasting from 1 1/2 to 5 minutes. Over the years, more than 1 million eruptions have been recorded."
558,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,Berkshire UK ,Disappointing. Over commercialised and we found very little wildlife anywhere in the park,"We spent three days driving throughout Yellowstone and visited virtually all the main areas and whilst we enjoyed ‘Old Faithful’ and a number of the other hot volcanic springs and geysers , we saw virtually no wildlife apart from some bison and deer a long way off in the distance.  I know the main tourist facilities near ‘Old Faithful’ are always going to be busy but there was no excuse for the way we were treated by the staff in the food to go restaurant located behind the main gift shop, the selection of food and drinks available was very limited and the queue for ice creams was enormous but there was no need for them to be rude and curt with us while we were trying to order our food and drinks.  We had a much better experience and saw lots more wildlife close-up at Custer State Park."
559,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Solo,"Kenosha, WI ",Through the park,"Wife and I went to see Yellowstone Park and old Faithful today.  Just as awesome as it was over 30 years ago when we brought our kids here.  Saw 3 deer and 1 grizzly bear. Had my window down and first thing out of my mouth was “ black bear”. Some gentleman corrected me rather quickly saying “Grizzly”.  Force of habit being from the Tennessee side of the Smokies and always seeing black bears.  Last time we were here it was summer. Don’t know if the weather makes a difference but the seemed to be many more fissures this time.  Met families from France, Australia and Georgia, just north of Atlanta. Also a family from Alaska.This is truly a world vacation destination.  Never been there, you gotta go. The scenery alone is worth the trip.Watching Old Faithful explode on time is wonderful to see."
560,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Richmond, Virginia, United States ",Not The Best Eruption,The eruption we saw was very average maybe below average so I expected more. There was another geyser we saw (forget name) that seemed just as big.So evidently not all eruptions are as spectacular as you might see in pictures but I'm glad I got to see it. As you might imagine parking and traffic can be a problem if you get there within 30 minutes of eruption time. And we were there last week of September (shoulder season). Tour guide dropped us off while we sat in traffic but we were 20 minutes from eruption. Made it with 5 minutes to spare.
561,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Macomb, MI ",Go early and avoid the crowds,The best time for viewing is early in the morning and on a clear blue sky day. We went upon our arrival to the area late afternoon. It was snowing (October 9th) and somewhat crowed with hundreds of people there to see the eruption. Many of them were rude and disrespectful. We visited again the next morning for the schedule 8:40 AM eruption and we enjoyed clear skies and only about a dozen people joining us.
562,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Ottawa, Canada ",A must see while visiting Yellowstone National Park,"Even though the surroundings to old faithful geyser have been set up as such a touristy place, boardwalks, seating, and the visitor center, you cannot miss this iconic event in the park. All of the infrastructure around Old Faithful allows everyone access and that is the upside."
563,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Coffs Harbour, Australia ",Interesting but too many people!,There is so many amazing and beautiful sights in Yellowstone without the huge amount of people that Old Faithful attracts. Yes it was certainly on the to do list but if we are ever blessed enough to return I would not bother! The most amazing sight for us was the huge and magnificent bison sitting near the footpath!
564,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Buffalo, NY ",Lives Up to its Name!,"It was great to see this old American icon in person. It’s impressive that they can predict its eruption within a 10 minute window. There may be others like Steamboat that others say are more exciting, but you can’t beat the predictability of Old Faithful, which is remarkable in itself.    We visited in late September, and the crowds were very manageable. Lots of parking available here. There are many other geysers to view here in the Upper Basin while you are waiting. Check the Visitor’s Center for times for Old Faithful, and for some of the others. The displays inside are worth viewing too if you have the time.    We purchased ice cream from the Lodge, and sat on the covered benches right outside for a perfect view of the show. You need to see it once to mark it off your bucket list!"
565,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Solo,"Eagle Mountain, UT, ",Good time of year to come here,"The crowds in early October are pretty small, especially in the late afternoon. Just before sunset there was only maybe hundred people total watching. Old Faithful is always a good place to visit."
566,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Tallahassee, FL ",Incredible,"Old Faithful was right on time for us, and the display was pure amazement. Seating around the geyser was plentiful, and even though there were hundreds upon hundreds of people there, we had no trouble finding the perfect spot to sit."
567,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Pitman, NJ ",Majestic,"What can be said of Old Faithful that hasn't already been said. This must be seen by everyone in person, the anticipation of waiing for it to erupt is on everyones mind. When Old Faithful erupts there is always a loud applause. It is truly something to be seen just magnificent."
568,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,midwest ,Spectacular,"Just as the name suggest, it isn't called Old Faithful for nothing. The Park rangers can tell, within, 10 minutes when it will go off. Usually about an hour. It is the only geyser that they can predict. The inn has clocks that will tell you when to expect the next one."
569,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Chelmsford, UK ",Its a Big Geyser,Quite a draw and was stunned by how many people encircled this thing on the provided seating. On our visit there were between 500 and 800 people - stopped counting when it started bubbling. This obviously is a must see if visiting the park. You can get an estimated time of eruption from the Park Website. As we walked away on completion people were arriving to get a seat for the next blow.
570,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018,not available,"Austin, TX ",It's a spray of water LOL,"I enjoyed this visit... It was neat to see Old Faithful do it ""thing"", but you know~ it's a spray of water into the air. The parking was reasonable, the time of year (August) wasn't overly crowded, and the surrounding lodge/vendor area is worth exploring. Bathrooms were mostly clean. Be sure to stop by the Blue Pools (Morning Glory was nice) on the way back north."
571,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Auckland Central, New Zealand ",Old Faithful on Time,"The experts know when Old Faithful with blow into the sky. There is a viewing area where many people gather. For a more personal view, along the path is just as good."
572,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Cohoes, NY ",Old faithful,Very cool watching old faithful get a seat away from the crowds in old faithful inn and watch the show. Nice gift shop get there early as it gets very crowded. Worth the trip.
573,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,Fort Atkinson ,"The most famous, but maybe not the best.","Yes Old Faithful is a postcard seared into our national park consciousness. However, as part of the upper geyser basin (and even Steamboat in Norris) there are others that are as scenic, blow higher or longer, are less crowded and are, therefore considerations for ""best"". That all said, it is still on the checklist for a Yellowstone visit. As an added bonus, and not coincidentally, the upper geyser basin is surrounded by lodging, dining, shopping and services."
574,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Kingston-upon-Hull, UK ",Move away from the crowds for the best view,"Old Faithful is great to see - it's a sanitised version of a geyser as there's little mystery as to when it will go off and it runs regular as clockwork. The visitor centre posts the time when it'll next go, and you can see it erupt several times a day if you wish.    People flock to the benches at the front to enjoy the spectacle with hundreds of others. Here's a tip: walk for ten or fifteen minutes to the back of the geyser and you'll see it free from other people.    It's an amazing piece of nature that's so easy to enjoy in peace away from others. I've no understanding why people just flock to the benches at the front."
575,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Solo,"Fleet, UK ",Bang on time,It was faithfully bang on time this morning. It is certainly worth visiting if nothing I haven’t seen before.
576,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,North Carolina ,Bucket List trip to Old Faithful,This was a must see. We sat and watched Old Faithful go off in the morning which was awesome. We went back another day and watched it again and must have taken 100 pictures!!!
577,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Skaneateles, NY ",Must do when visiting Yellowstone,"Old Faithful is a great stop when in Yellowstone. It is very crowded, which is expected. A time is posted in the visitor center as to when the geyser will erupt (about every hour or so) but there is plenty to do while you wait."
578,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,Mumbai ,Nature's Mystery,"Amongst all the geysers in the yellowstone region, this one is unique. This geyser comes into action with a predetermined interval of about 1- 1/2 hours. Hence we get to see the dormant version as well as the active geyser multiple times a day. Truely Amazing...."
579,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Niagara Falls, NY ",Didn’t disappoint,"Seeing Old Faithful was our primary stop in Yellowstone and we weren’t disappointed.  A pleasant surprise was the numerous other geysers in the area. While waiting, we were treated with an eruption of the Bee Hive."
580,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Pocono Summit, PA ",Impressive,"Although not quite as impressive as some of the geysers I saw in Iceland, it is definitely a MUST SEE in Yellowstone. We went on the Wednesday after LAbor Day and felt like we had the whole park to ourselves. Breakfast at the Inn was very good and not as expensive as you might think.  The Geyser erupted around guesstimated schedule and lasted for a few minutes. Mission accomplished."
581,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples, ,A must see,"Old Faithful is a must see while visiting Yellowstone. It's amazing to watch and there are other geysers to see as well. One of my favorites in Yellowstone,"
582,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Huntington Beach, United States ",Great natural show,Make your schedule flexible because there is an approximate time for the show but its just a window. It can be 15 to30 minutes difference on both sides so plan carefully. Get there early so you can get a seat for the show. The best location is in front of the ranger station. Also there is some great information and help waiting there for you.
583,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,"Boston, MA ",Good spot for a pause,"This is a large area with shops and places to eat. Also old Faithful erupts - so if you have some time, its a good place to catch a break, and wait for the predictable eruption.  There is a Yellowstone app, that you can view to see the likely next predicted eruption to plan your time accordingly - it worked well for our trip.  There are benches for seating all the way around, and several other geysers to check out while in this area.  We sat and had our lunch and those around us all started to chat.  It did get crowded the closer eruption time came, but there arent any bad seats to watch from.  We had to pop back into this area a second time, and actually had a Bison right next to our car!"
584,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Underwhelmed at best,"I’m sure many people have “Old Faithful” on their bucket list. Well it may be un American but after viewing it with a thousand of my closest friends I walked away underwhelmed. It’s tall, it’s predictable, the bucket list item is checked but admittedly there were better things to do at Yellowstone. What ever you do, don’t pay the exorbitant fee to stay at the Inn. Just go in and admire the lobby. This is not a place to spend the bulk of your vacation."
585,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Tucson, AZ ","Eruptions not as faithful, but still exciting","Due to various earthquakes over time Old Faithful is not as faithful as it used to be, but you can still see its erupt approximately every 90 minutes. Be sure to check the Old Faithful Inn, Visitor Center or a park ranger to tell you when the next estimate eruption will be. It is worth the wait, but you will need to be there at least 30 minutes before if you want a seat."
586,Old_Faithful,Oct 2018 , Couples,wilds of New Jersey ,Iconic geyser,"The estimated time of the next eruption is posted in the lodge lobby nearby, so there is no need to spend too much extra time waiting for its next ""performance"". You can even see it from the lodge's balconies. It is a stunner."
587,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Bellaire, MI ",Never gets old,"Just mesmerizing watching the Geyser. Phenomenal how the rangers can predict the time. It’s fun to watch at different times of the day, as sun, shadows, etc can enhance your photos!"
588,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Wichita, KS ",Nice stopping point,"We had a great spot for viewing the eruption of the geyser. Plenty of things to do as you wait. Food, restrooms, hikes, etc."
589,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,Montana ,Beautiful,Old faithful did not disappoint. Parking was plentiful. The area was well kept and clean. Park staff were friendly and available. Must stop and see.
590,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,"Melbourne, FL ",It's faithful,"This was not the most impressive geyser we saw. But it guaranteed we would see one, if we didn't get lucky with the others. It's kind of an historic site, so kind of a must-see. The visitor center posts the predicted eruption times. There are also a lot of other very interesting and cool features in the vicinity, so plenty to see. Don't forget to stop into the art museum - they have children and adult classes, and the artist, Linda Aman, is wonderful. And if you have kids, the visitor center has a junior scientist booklet and backpack with supplies, for $5. You rent for 3 hrs, and the kiddos can investigate different features. The favorite for my son was the little ""gun"" you point at things, and it tells you the temperature. He enjoyed checking the temperature of everything from the steam vents, to buffalo droppings, to the inside of our mouths. This is great if you have more than 1/2 day here, but very difficult to complete for the badge in that amount of time if you're trying to see all the features."
591,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Oklahoma City, OK ",yep it is faithful,"Steamboat geyeser was doing a better dance than old faithful the day we were there, but it is not as punctual as old faithful."
592,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Sacramento, CA ",WOW AMAZING PLACE,I have been to Old Faithful Geyser before but each time it just gets better.    Parts of the walking path by the other geysers were closed as the staff advised there had been excessive geyser activity.    We still had a great time and stayed to watch Old Faithfull twice
593,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,"Got to be seen, but not as impressive as you may think...","I don't know why, but I thought it would be bigger. Not just me saying that by the way, a number of people commented on that. I think sometimes the hype surrounding an attraction can overshadow the facts.    Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. We watched it erupt twice, and listened to the very informative talk from a ranger once. That alone was worth the visit. For me, the real magic of the Old Faithfull visit was the surrounding geological fissures, geysers, springs and landscape. Vibrant colours abound, whilst bubbling, popping and hissing provide a soundtrack.    Worth the visit."
594,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Garner, NC ",A sight to see!,Old Faithful truly lives up to its' name. The park predicts it eruptions with uncanny accuracy. You should be able to plan to see multiple eruptions.
595,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Minneapolis, MN, ",As good as expected,"We thought we may be let down a bit by this overly touristy attraction, yet, our fears were allayed when we watched it (two times) erupt.    If you have some time to kill before the ""show"" and want to grab a quick bite to eat, in the Yellowstone Lodge there is a bar as you first enter, and it offers a limited menu of decent food and best of all, no line, no waiting."
596,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ","Every 94 minutes, it does its thing.",That's why they call it Old Faithful. We were there for 2 days and saw it erupt 6 times. There is plenty of good hiking and other geysers which are easily available.
597,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Bethany, Ok ",Faithful as Always,"I have heard about Old Faithful since I was a child. I've watching it in movies and on TV but when ""Kevin"" our guide ran in the Old Faithful Lodge and came out and said it should start in 10 minutes give or take a few I thought,""sure!"" In 15 minutes there it started. It was wonderful but what amazed me was the timing.  After Old Faithful finished its eruption another ine right next to it started erupting. Someone says it starts the same time everyday.  Incredible!!!"
598,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Davenport, IA ",Variable displays,"It's pretty close to the posted expected times, but each eruption is variable in ""enthusiasm"" of eruption. Staying at the Inn, we saw many eruptions and only a couple were spectacular."
599,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,"Ashland, OH ",Most Famous Geyser in Yellowstone,Returning to Yellowstone this year warranted a visit to the North Geyser Basin -- the star attraction is of course Old Faithful. This year I took in the standard viewing from the boardwalk during the day but also ventured up to Observation Point to watch an eruption. I also headed out super early (5:30-6AM) to watch and early morning eruption and had the entire boardwalk to myself -- one of the favorite parts of my visit. I took some of my first night time photographs and was lucky enough to catch OF with the stars. Wish I was there now!
600,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family, ,of course a must see,"how can anyone visit yellowstone and not see old faithful. Yes it was on time but best part every time it was little different in strength and duration, so watch it more than once"
601,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Ruston, LA ",How could one visit Yellowstone without visiting Old Faithful?,"The best times, in my opinion, to visit Old Faithful is in the morning and late afternoon. Although, it erupts approximately every 44 to 125 minutes. It was named in 1870 during the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to receive a name. This truly is a must see attraction in Yellowstone Park."
602,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,"Canton, IL ",Old Faithful,This was fun! We were there on a beautiful day. I loved the seating area that they have for people to view the geyser. Get there early!
603,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",View at different times of day,Plan to view it more than once and if possible different times of days or different days. It’s truly different every time it blows. Grab a meal and take a stroll in the boardwalk and watch from a different perspective. The trail to the geyser basin is a great way to see the diversity and keep your eye on old faithful. Plan for crowds during the mid morning to early evening hours.
604,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Liberty, MO ",A great attraction,Old Faithful and the other geysers in this area are a can’t miss. Plan to spend several hours seeing several of the more predictable geysers go off. Check out the prediction times inside and try to be patient and see more than just Old Faithful.  I would recommend a whole day.
605,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Louisville, KY ",Checking out the landmark,"My husband and I really enjoyed seeing Old Faithful, the food and drinks at Old Faithful Inn, and The Visitors Center are recommended as well."
606,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Panama City Beach, FL ",Just one of the sites to visit in Yellowstone,There are benches and s boardwalk that keep visitors s safe distance from the geyser. Bring your camera and after it erupts visit the other steam and boiling pots that surround Old Faithful. Ask a park ranger for the time it goes off.
607,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Dallas, GA ",Wouldn’t Wait Again,"After having lunch, we walked around the Old Faithful grounds, which has beautiful scenery, waiting almost an hour for the next eruption and it’s a beautiful thing to see but, IMO, I was expecting to see more, and didn’t feel like it was worth waiting for."
608,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Business,"Gulfport, MS ",A MUST-DO visit when in Yellowstone!,"Our group visit included a stop at Old Faithful and it was well worth waiting for. Upon arrival, we checked inside the Old Faithful Lodge to see when Old Faithful was scheduled to erupt again. We had enough time to visit the gift shop and walk through the Lodge before heading out to witness Old Faithful erupt. We weren't disappointed! It is a beautiful sight. Once the eruption was over, we visited Old Faithful Inn and the surrounding museum, General Store and other building in the complex. It was a good couple hours spent in beautiful Yellowstone."
609,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Staten Island, NY, ",Grand old geyser,We watched Old Faithful spout twice. The second eruption was higher and lasted longer. It was wonderful to behold.
610,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA ",Worth the wait.,Hike around the geyser. Hike up the trial to observation point to see the geyser from above. Visitor center had very helpful guides. Request maps and ask for their input.
611,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,"Spokane, WA ","If your in Yellowstone, You've got to visit Old Faithful","We spent two days at Yellowstone National Park and of course we had to see old faithful. We visited the park in September, and found the park not crowded at all. We arrived at Old Faithful and as advertised, it erupted almost right on time. If your visiting Yellowstone and don't want to battle the crowds, I would recommend September. Temps are nice and the park not crowded."
612,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples, ,Garunteed eruptions,"If you want a garunteed eruption at set times. This is the place to go. Gets very crowded, so don't expect a intimate view. Still, this is a must do"
613,Old_Faithful,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Erie, MI ",Beautiful and very regular!,The only way Old Faithful could be more regular it would have to be taking Ex-Lax. It is close and consistant!!! It is also super beautiful and fantastic too. It is very hard to discribe any thing that is this spectactular. There is not a bad seat in the house!!
614,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"North Las Vegas, NV ",Magnificent and not to be missed,"When you feel the ground rumble and hear the sounds as the geyser erupts, the site of the geyser is awesome. Not to be missed. and there are plenty of vantage points."
615,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Maryville, TN ",Otherworldly,You hear so much about old faithful that it is a little disappointing when you see it. The good thing is that it is consistent and easy to reach even if using cane or walker. If you are able walk out and see grand and castle geysers. They are not that far and both are spectacular.
616,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018,not available,"Inverness, UK ",A damp squib,Went early to avoid the crowds. Old Faithful duly performed but never really got going. After walking round the upper geyser basin we returned and waited for old faithful again but this time with several hundred others. Again a spluttering damp squib. Whilst walking around the upper basin we witnessed by chance eruptions of both Daisy and the Lion geyser which were far more spectacular.    It seems some folk just go to see Old Faithful and then leave. If you do that you miss out on so many unique and fascinating thermal features. Old faithful may be the most predictable geyser but it is certainly not the best.
617,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Bonen, Germany ","Great, but expect crowds","It‘s a great experience to watch the Old Faithful to erupt, but don‘t expect to be there all by yourself. We have visited in August and it was a lot of people visiting. Leaving after the eruption felt like leaving a stadium after a big sports event or concert. The entire park offers a lot of nature and quietness, but the Old Faithful area is very well visited.  But it really is worth coming here, just be sure you are there in time, to have a good view."
618,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Philadelphia, PA ",meh..,apparently someone messed with other geysers within the system and old faithful is not as powerful as it once was. it is the premier stop and if you can time it right you should stop and see but if not there is so many other things to spend time one.
619,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Reedley, California, Usa ",In person!,"I have see Old Faithful many times on TV. Now I have seen it live and in person. A must to see, a wonder to behold."
620,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,"Brooklyn Park, MN ",Always Spectacular,We’ve seen Old Faithful a number of times and it is always great. I’d recommend seeing it from a vantage point other than the standard viewing deck in a semi circle around the cone. Try going downwind if it and letting the spray hit you. What a cool feeling.
621,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Catskill, NY ",Amazing,"I suggest once you know the approximate time, and you want to sit close you get there at least 30 minutes before. We’ve been here before for so that wasn’t important to us. We just wanted to see it again. It’s just amazing no matter how many times you see it!"
622,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Lakewood Ranch, FL ",What can I say??,"This is the old man himself. Others could be higher, others could be longer, but Old Faithful is the one to see. You can't come to Yellowstone and not see the most famous one!"
623,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Family,Kent ,Old Faithful Geysers,"We watched the eruption of the geysers at the famous Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming."
624,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Lewes, DE ",Worth the 1 hour wait,We arrived about an hour before it was supposed to erupt. It was a bit chilly but not crowded at all (early in the morning). It only lasts a few seconds but pretty cool to see.
625,Old_Faithful,Oct 2017 , Solo,"Leiderdorp, The Netherlands ",Famous geyser,"The geyser itself is famous, but I found it a little bit overhyped. Sitting on a bench and waiting for the next eruption is not really my thing. I think there are more impressive places in Yellowstone - like the Norris Geyser basin. What makes the old faithful attractive though is the entire site around this famous geyser. Its a huge place complete with lodges, village, vistor center and many hiking trails into the surrounding area."
626,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Casa Grande, AZ ",Worth the Wait!,"We sat for an hours and 20 minutes or so, but it was worth waiting. I was very happy to have been able to view this and check it off the bucked list. We had a great time talking with others from all over the word!"
627,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"York, PA ",What can one say? This is the iconic geyser.,Check at the Visitor's Center for the estimated time of the next eruption. Check the wind direction to get upwind of the geyser so that you'll see more than a huge cloud of steam.
628,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Rehoboth Beach, DE ",A National Treasure,You cannot go to Yellowstone without stopping to see Old Faithful. It erupts every 90 minutes so be sure to stay to watch it erupt. It is an amazing sight!
629,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends, ,A must see just because the eruption time is predicatable,"This is not the tallest nor the most majestic looking geyser in the national park. But as its name implies, it adheres to a faithful eruption schedule meaning that almost anyone should be able to see at least one eruption while visiting the park. Ergo, this is a must see. The viewing area encircles the geyser and is some distance away meaning that most anyone can get a good view of the eruption (unless you are stuck behind some tall guys)."
630,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"San Antonio, TX ",AWESOME,Amazing and fascinating to watch. Beautiful area - should be prepared to spend time there. You could wait up to 90 minutes to watch “Old Faithful” erupt. But there is a lot to do there - trails - restaurant-
631,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018,not available,"Warsaw, VA ",Disappointed,"Wasn’t much to it, it spit out some water and lasted a few minutes. Some of the other geysers do the same thing just not as big."
632,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"North Andover, MA ",Worth the visit but go early or late,"Beat the crowds by going early or after 5pm. Don’t hurry back to your car; if you’re up for it, do the 3 mile hike around all of the boardwalks. You’ll see countless pools, fumaroles, and other smaller geysers that are breathtaking. Worth the time and the walk."
633,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Friends,"New York City, NY ",Old faithful was faithful,There is a website where you can find details as when it will come out . Usually it’s between 70-90 min depending on previous one .  Take a seat to get best view so arrive 20-30 before.  Tons of parking and food options  Buffet are $16 for lunch  Overall its commercialized but must see
634,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Morganton, NC ",Great,This place is majestic to bad Xanterra and the park service don't do enough to keep it up. Lots of litter and poor maintenance.
635,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",An American icon!,We actually saw it twice!!! This is a part of Yellowstone National Park that you absolutely must visit!
636,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Vancouver, Canada ","Wow, What a Geyser!","We’ve all heard about Old Faithful and think we know what to expect. Viewing this spectacle in person is another matter — AMAZING to watch water gushing into the air at what I can only guess at 40 or 50’! And to make it even more special there were two smaller geysers gushing at the same time, in behind Old Faithful. It was a definite WOW."
637,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018,not available,"Allen, TX ",Must See,"If you are in Yellowstone, this is a park highlight and must see. Expect large crowds so get there about 30 minutes before expected eruption. When we were there it went off within 10 minutes of projected time.    Pick up an ice cream cone before going out to sit in the sun. Makes the wait more enjoyable.    Parking is a nightmare.... so be patient.    Old faithful lodge is an amazing old hotel right there and is worth a quick stop to get out of the heat and get an ice cream cone. They have hand scooped ice cream vs soft serve so a better stop than the other cafes."
638,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,Kansas ,Can't miss it,"It's nothing spectacular, but it's Old Faithful, so you have to at least watch it erupt once. They have predicted eruption times in lobby of the lodge so you can plan a little visit there, walk around, and likely not miss anything. There are much larger geysers to see, but this one is so predictable and it's a fun stop."
639,Old_Faithful,Apr 2018,not available,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Can't miss it!,"Totally worth the hype and a must see at Yellowstone. On busy days it does get crowded so get there early before the predicted eruption if you want a good video or picture. Other than that, you can definitely see the geyser over the crowd."
640,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Solo,"Edison, NJ, ",WOW,"The geyser goes off regularly during the day and night. The staff is pretty good at predicting when it will go off within + or - 10 minutes. During the day, there are rangers who come out and talk about Old Faithful - history/characteristics, etc about 10-15 minutes for its predicted eruption. It does get crowded, especially as it gets closer to the predicted eruption time. There are benches available to sit on while waiting."
641,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Warfield, UK ",Amazing,What a magnificent geyser. We saw it erupt as predicted which was wonderful. The trails around the site to other geysers and springs was done extremely well and very informative
642,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Walla Walla, WA ",Still Going,Great visit to Yellowstone! Old Faithful producing a beautiful plume and the Park Service facilities make the experience very user friendly.
643,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018,not available,"Andover, NJ ",Worth the visit,We’ve seen Old Faithful many times on tv so we were not expecting to be overwhelmed. But being there and seeing it in person was really exciting! We went back and saw it a second time the next day!
644,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Dartmouth, Canada ",So interesting and scenic,"Visited with another couple and enjoyed the whole park! We were lucky as the ""Old Faithful"" geyser erupted within 15 minutes of us arriving! The cafeteria, walking trails, gift shop and lodge were all worth visiting!"
645,Old_Faithful,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Annapolis, MD ",Find sites less crowded and more moving,"This is the postcard of the park but you will find fewer crowds and more awe-inspiring scenery in so many other places with a little effort. Don’t linger here. Drive the lake side of the park to the canyon through the dawn for spectacular views of fog, geyser steam, animals, sun rise - literally everything is different again before sunrise. The roads will have only a few cars. Bring proper footwear and a jacket and get down the trails of canyon falls as the sun comes up. On the north side you can hike down to the crest of the falls and look out the canyon as the rising sun engulfs the mist."
646,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Columbus, Ohio, ",Lots of people but enough space to move around.,Lots and lots of people but plenty of space outside to make it not crowded. We ate at the restaurant. Burgers. Was ok but a bit pricey. They have a gas station and also mechanics on duty in case you have car trouble. We did! We had our engine light come on so we had them hook us up to the computers to see what the issue was. Nothing that was imperative to do now and could be done when we got home but it was nice to have that if you needed it. Parking lot is very big and larger rv's and trucks and travel trailers park at the farthest points. They had one port o potty shed near that side of the parking lot. Gift shop and store inside. We chose not to wait for the next time slot that is anticipated for the geyser to shoot. But they did have benches and so on for you to sit if you wanted to wait.
647,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Sydney, Australia ","Even if you find Yellowstone disappointing overall (refer our seperate review of Park), Old Faithful will not disappoint","Compared to ponds of hot water bubbling & hot mud bubbling, Old Faithful is spectacular. Do not set your expectations too high however. It does not erupt with perhaps as much force as you imagine, and clouds of steam can obscure the vision of a shaft of water soaring on high. The greenies will shudder at this comment, but frankly, the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas are more spectacular. Nevertheless, it is worth seeing.  Do not be concerned if all the semi-circle of seating is taken when you arrive. Walk beyond the seating around the circle surrounding the geiser and you will get just as good a view - with one caveat: Ensure you are not perfectly downwind from it, as then all you may see is a cloud of steam obscuring your view of the water jet. Ideally, get 90° to the wind so you see the steam & water seperate.  As others have commented, take care to note (& maybe document) where you park your car. Otherwise it might take you a long time to find it.  If timing allows, take in the visitor centre explanation of what drives the geiser, or if you are lucky, the Ranger talk on same might be held when you are there."
648,Old_Faithful,Jun 2018 , Family,"Honolulu, HI ",This Was Probably One of Your Draws to Yellowstone,"Ok, so most people have at least heard of Old Faithful. But is it worth a visit? Definitely if you are in the Yellowstone area. Some notes:    * The parking lot is INSANEly huge. It literally reminds me of the parking lot at Disneyland just that everything is spread out. Expect to get in some mileage on your feet.    *The area is huge too. You probably will need to use the maps to find your car, the restaurants, stores, hotel, visitor center, etc.    *There are lots of people of course. But you know what, the area was so big that it didn't feel overcrowded. The crowds actually felt manageable and pretty much no matter where you go around Old Faithful you will have a pretty decent view.    *The geyser erupts often (they have approximate times in the visitor center). While we were there we saw it twice. It is pretty cool what nature can do.    *From here we did parts of the Geyer Trail. We made it to Castle Geyser and turned around. This walk is worth it but wish we could have done more.    *It was June when we went and we expected it to be hot (Mammoth, Canyon, and Norris area where pretty hot. Our day in the Old Faithful area was actually pretty cool and windy."
649,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"New Johnsonville, TN ",A great place to visit!,My friends and I kept missing Old Faithul while traveling throw Yellowstone. We always showed up as it had ended. The best thing is to get there a little early as it goes off +/- 15 minutes every 90 minutes.    It's well worth the wait to see. This is a must while in Yellowstone!
650,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Eau Claire, WI ",Pretty overrated in the grand scheme,"Old Faithful is overrun with tourists attempting to get the best view, holding cell phones over their head, standing on benches, obstructing views with no care for anyone else. It’s the most overrun area of the park and it’s neat to watch but underwhelming compared to other things in the park. I knew it wouldn’t be my favorite but I felt like I had to go. This is one of those things that once you’ve seen it that’s enough. I’d do the other geysers but skip old faithful in the future. The lodge was very interesting and worth a visit, however."
651,Old_Faithful,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Washington DC, DC, ",Worth hiking up Observation Point (1.6 miles round trip) for a sweeping view,"Old Faithful is of course the must see geyser in Yellowstone. It does go off regularly - about every 1-1.5 hour. There are bench seats around it to get a close up view, or you can take a short hike up Observation Point - trail starts behind Old Faithful Lodge (1.6 mile round trip, moderately steep) to get an overhead view and the surrounding landscape. Quite a few people hike up but nothing compared to the crowd down below. We hiked up for the first eruption, then took our time coming down with a detour by way of the Solitay Geyser - not a must see but we just wanted to log a few more steps, and after checking out the store a bit got to watch the next eruption close up. This is one of the most visited sights but there is plenty of parking in the huge lot."
652,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Newtown, PA ",Must see Old Faithful!,"Old Faithful never disappoints watch twice, once as you get there and see the Inn then come back after viewing Castle Geyser and some other geysers along the walk!"
653,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Stockton, IL ",Of course you go there!,"Saw 4 wonderful eruptions, one with rainbows. The first one was 15 minutes late, the others pretty close to predicted times. Surprised by also seeing the Grand Geyser an hour early while waiting for OF. Stayed at the OF Inn, highly recommended. Everyone has to do this once. Hope I can again sometime."
654,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Buddina, Australia, ",Good to see but there are more stunning geysers and fumarols to see,"If you visit the park, you just have to see Old Faithful in action. Regular as clockwork every 90 mins +/- 10 mins. The geyser hits a height of 60m, not the highest in the park but at least you can set your watch by it. There is simple seating and areas to witness the phenomenon, and you can even sit in the nearby restaurant and watch it from there. But the rest of the park also has the most amazing mud pools, other geysers, hot tents, fumarols etc. Just awesome!"
655,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Huntington, WV ",Stunning,I was unprepared for how awesome an eruption is. I have always read and heard about this. To be there in person and witness an eruption was actually emotional. It was so beautiful and powerful.  Definitely a must do!
656,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Greenville, WI ",What you would expect,A must see but it is not the best feature of the park or the area. Take a look at the hotel and the surrounding geyser fields.
657,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Leesburg, VA ",Must see,"Old Faithful Geyser erupts approximately every 90 minutes, give or take 10 minutes. I recommend you check with the visitor center for the schedule. As we were leaving, we saw some kids changing the time outside which obviously gave visitors the wrong time regarding the next eruption. Old Faithful's popularity is due to a dependent schedule, but the eruption itself is glorious. It gets crowded rather quickly, so make sure you find a front seat early so you can take videos or photos."
658,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",Great sight,I'm not sure what to write in review except that you must go there if you get a chance in your life.
659,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Logan, UT ","Crowded, but you have to stop and see it","You have to see this just because it is the most famous part of Yellowstone. It is by far the most crowded attraction in the park, so be prepared to be looking through or over crowds to set it erupt. Be sure to walk the trails behind the Old Faithful geyser to see a whole bunch of other active geysers and springs, along with a very scenic walk along the river."
660,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Venice, FL ",Amazing,We arrived just before an eruption on a tour bus. Old Faithful is aptly named as it has erupted about every 90 minutes for a very long time. All the buildings list the time of the next eruption but you know when it is close by the amount of people surrounding the area. We were there long enough to view 3 times while we were there. It is a definite must see experience.
661,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Tucson, AZ ",Timing is Everything,"OF is on an approximate 90 minute cycle. Times are posted at the front desk in the OF Inn and are +/-10 min, so plan to be there 10 min early! It’s always magnificent."
662,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"La Quinta, CA ",A must see while in the Park!,"We took the loop road heading west making our first stop at Old Faithful. We were lucky enough to get great parking, then headed to Old Faithful and only had to wait a few minutes until she blew! It was so exciting to see and so proud to be part of this great country that has so much beauty to offer!"
663,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Jerusalem, Israel, ",Dont miss it,Don’t miss it. The geizer in old faithful is theeeeee one you should see. The other geizers after you see that are beautiful but.....
664,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Lewisburg, TN ",Erupts Right on Time Every Time,"This was our First visit to Yellowstone National Park. We were just going to do a drive through with a few stops here and there, so we wanted to be sure to see ""Old Faithful"".  We were not disappointed. Just before Old Faithful erupts, many of the surrounding geysers put on a bit of a show, but when Old Faithful lets go, it just flat out steals the show. Geyser burst 50-60 ft., perhaps more, and is loud, and just like that, it settles back down to a constant steaming vent. Pretty Cool!"
665,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Solo,"Hays, KS, ",Amazing,"Old Faithful is a must stop in Yellowstone. They have posted the estimated time of the next eruption, so easy to plan for as you shop or eat. Plenty of seating with a good view. No extra charge. Great for all ages."
666,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Solo,"Surrey, Canada ",Amazing don’t eat at the Cafeteria,"My trip through the park started early and I was at Old Faithful by 1030. They had a guess when the next experience would go (1135) so it gave me time to walk around. This park is amazing for being accessible. I was seated near Old Faithful at 1120 and the experience went off at 1131. I went to the cafeteria next for lunch. It was horrible. I went for a noodle box which consisted of spaghetti, dry chicken and some peanut sauce. The service was horrible and the food was horrible. Other than that my day in Yellowstone was fantastic."
667,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Solo,"Drayton Valley, Canada ",The Wonders of Nature,"While old faithful is the main event the wonders of Yellowstone shine stronger than the one attraction.

669,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018 , Family,"Philadelphia, PA ",MAKE THIS YOUR LAST STOP OF THE DAY,"We drove all over Yellowstone throughout the day. Saw all there was to see and then we made it to Old Faithful. There is a sign telling you the approximate time it will erupt (within +/- 10 minutes). The sign told us 6:50pm. Get there at least a 1/2 hour ahead to get yourself situation because you will have many ""friends"" to share the sight with. Without any fanfare at all, it just happens, so be poised with your camera. It was a beautiful thing to see. Try to estimate which way the wind is blowing so you can see the spout of water and not just all steam."
670,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,Central Illinois ,A natural treasure,"Might be ""touristy"" but this is just a treasure that inspires awe. Crowds gather and wait patiently. Then, a collective gasp as the geyser erupts! For just a few seconds, you are one with hundreds of people as you watch this natural treasure."
671,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,alabama ,The Master,"Amazingly Old Faithful erupts pretty close the time noted by the park rangers and varies from 65 to 95 minutes-they are good. You can tell by the crowds when it is going off, if every one is leaving, then it just erupted, if all the seating is taken, then it is ready to erupt. It is truly spectacular and faithful."
672,Old_Faithful,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Mumbai, India ",Keeps up to the name,Old faithful is probably the most visited spot in Yellowstone National Park. It gets crowded. Surrounding of the geyser is not as beautiful as other geysers in Yellowstone.  If you have to wait for the geyser then its worthwhile to visit Old Faithful Inn.
673,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Wareham, UK ",Bucket list visit,This was somewhere I had always wanted to visit and I was not disappointed. In the end we saw this several times each time was very enjoyable
674,Old_Faithful,Jun 2018 , Family,"Hasselt, Belgium ",Not the nicest geyser in Yellowstone. Crowded.,There were an enormous amount of people waiting for Old Faithful to erupt. We had high expectations and were a bit disappointed. Yellowstone NP has nicer geysers than this one.
675,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples, ,Rip off Hotel,"I have read the other reviews and I must say they are accurate and honest or at least I concur.    What I don’t understand is how can so many travelers rate a hotel lodge 4 stars when you are paying close to $350 -$400 nightly with nothing in return.    Is it too much to desire to be comfortable in your room with these rates. Seriously , a tiny plastic fan. Is it too much to expect decent WiFi. I’m not cool with no TV but I won’t make it an issue.    I gave 2 stars out of respect for the friendly staff. This location is poorly managed and deserving of no stars at all.    It’s my fault I guess ,my expectations were to experience a Hotel and restaurant similar to other places that commands $400 a night. If I paid $75 a night I would not expect anything. But I did pay $400 and it wasn’t to camp out in a warm room with no Ac no WiFi and no TV and low quality food. I just feel ripped off.    These trips usually are one and done for most. Do your research and check your options.    Lower your expectations or check if nearby accommodations have what you require for a comfortable experience."
676,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Rock Springs, WY ",Stop but move on to better places...,"Old Faithful is the heart of Yellowstone Park. A must see for sure. Stop, see the geyser, get some snacks, a couple keepsakes from the store and then move on...there is a lot more to see. Don't spend the entire day here."
677,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018,not available,"Dallas, TX ",Have To See,"Of course you have to see Old Faithful when you visit Yellowstone. It is pretty cool, but certainly not the highlight of our visit.    They have a great visitor center. Stop there first as they will post the time of the next eruption within 10 minutes. You can learn all about the park while you wait.    Also check out the Old Faithful Lodge, a great example of national park architecture. You can gab an espresso in the lobby to enjoy while you view the geyser eruption. Very civilized!"
678,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"New York City, NY ",The heart of YNP...see it early to avoid crowds,"The Old Faithful is without a doubt the heart and center of Yellowstone. It erupts every 90 minutes or so and the eruption predictions are fairly accurate. It’s some sight to see it erupt at over 100-120ft into the air. Eruptions last anywhere from 90 seconds to 5 minutes. Best time to view it IMO, just like any other attraction in YNP, is early morning with less crowds. This place is swarming with people by 11am onwards. First eruption is usually between 8-9am if I’m not mistaken. We had breakfast at Old Faithful at 7am and went straight for the eruption, which on that day was 8:31. Worked out perfect for us.    Do the loops around Old Faithful, some pretty magnificent geysers and sights around it. You can skip the Observation Point Home if you want. The view from up there is just ok."
679,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Bremerton, WA ",See it from The Walkway,I’ve seen Old Faithful errupt quite a few times. The last time I was at Yellowstone our room had two windows in the old Faithful Lodge overlooking Old Faithful. I’ve stood with the masses of people and watch it and did that again this trip but the place I really enjoyed it this time was straight across on the walkway. There was just our family and a handful of others and it made it truly remarkable.
680,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"London, UK, ",Impressive.,Waited over an hour for it to blow but when it did it was incredible. The water blasted at least a 100 feet and kept going for a considerable time. Well worth the wait.
681,Old_Faithful,May 2018 , Couples,"Sydney, Australia ",Take a few hours,It is worth the while to take a few hours and walk around the basin while you wait for Old Faithful to let off steam. There is a wonderful loop boardwalk and so many interesting geysers that you can see. If you don't have a lot of time in the park this spot is worth taking time as you get to see a lot of different forms and pools.
682,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Boise, ID ",Never gets old,I came to Old Faithful when I was a girl. I brought my 4 children when they were growing up every year and this year my 3 grandchildren were also there. My children had not been to Yellowstone for 20 years what a special treat

686,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Ocala, FL, ",A Don't Miss Landmark,"Are there bigger geysers in the park - yes, but this is the granddaddy of them all, and you shouldn't miss it. There is a large crowd, but observation area is available 360 degrees around the geyser, so you can still see it just fine. The morning we were there, it spouted on time, 10:30 AM. The area, which is full of shops, lodges, and a visitor center, is very heavily populated, but there seemed to be sufficient parking when we visited in early August."
687,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Coal City, IL ",Stands up to its name! On time!,"Plenty of parking, benches to sit and boardwalks. Enjoy dining options and watch the geyser explode every hour. Kids love to watch it. Short walk from park lot, no charge. Scenic views of old faithful and ski Lodge/hotel is large and uniquely designed. Featured in a few movies, a good stop on way around Yellowstone park."
688,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Portland, OR ",A joy to see,Old faithful is amazing but one of dozens of geysers that are natural treasures. Get out to the geyser basins early to avoid the crowds!
689,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Snow Camp, NC ",More impressive than I thought.,"Don't miss at least one eruption of Old Faithful. Thankfully, there are numerous postings of the expected time of the next eruption. Appx. 90 minutes between eruptions. Take a video, take photos and at least once, just watch it. The waiting/seating area is in the total sun so unless you just HAVE To have a front seat, just wait for it to start filling up before going. You can see it erupt in comfort from the balcony of the Old Faithful Inn and other places around. It is apt to give a few false spurts before the actual eruption, which lasts a few minutes. Be courteous and make sure you aren't blocking someone's view."
690,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018 , Family,"Sheffield, UK ",An amazing site,We were very lucky we arrived here about 20 mins before old faithful erupted. There are plenty of benches to sit and watch from. This has to be on your priority list to see .
691,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family, ,Worth seeing but. . .,"We spent 8 days hiking through YNP and only happened to see Old Faithful because we were doing the Biscuit Basin Loop. Is it beautiful? Yes. Is it worth seeing? Yes. However there are much more interesting geysers within the basin such as Giant, Beehive etc. The advantage is the predictability. For those who drive through YNP and only stop at 2-3 places, this is worth seeing. The 10% of visitors who actually get out and hike, I recommend the Black Sand Basin loop instead."
692,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Fort Collins, CO ",A Must See!,This was the main reason we visited Yellowstone. It was a wonderful experience and there is so much to learn. It’s a great activity and one not to miss.

I have photos but they don’t quite capture the intensity. Go-see for yourself!"
695,Old_Faithful,Jul 2018,not available,"Steubenville, OH ",Family vacation,This is obviously a must see in Yellowstone. I would try to get there about 15 minutes early to get a good view because it can get very crowded but it’s worth the wait. You have to see it at least once in your life.
696,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Family,"Downers Grove, IL ",Iconic Must Do in Yellowstone NP,"Old Faithful Village is huge. Lots of facilities and shops. To view Old Faithful for the first time, we hiked 0.8 miles up to Observation Point (moderate hike with an elevation gain of perhaps 200 feet. The path is not paved and people with difficultly walking would not be able to do it. At the top, there were maybe 15 people. Great elevated vantage point, not only for Old Faithful but also the other geyser basins in the area. Afterward, we hiked back down and had lunch at the Old Faithful Inn – by the time we finished lunch and walked back outside, Old Faithful was ready to blow again. So we waited a few minutes and saw it from ground level – a nice “twofer” for our time in the village."
697,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Johnson City, TN ","True to its name, you can count on Old Faithful","Stunning geyser, spouting steam and water hundreds of feet into the air. True to its name, Old Faithful regularly erupts about ever 90 minutes."
698,Old_Faithful,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Ocean City, MD ",Who would ever miss it if in Yellowstone,I would think no one goes to Yellowstone and doesn’t make a stop to see Old Faithfull. It’s got to be at the top of everyone’s list.    Projected eruption times are posted in visitors center.    Tip. Find the time. Walk part of the lower basin trail and stop at a spot where Old Faithful is visible. Better view than sitting on the benches circling the geyser. Less crowded and you’ll be ahead of the crowd that heads on the trail often the eruption
