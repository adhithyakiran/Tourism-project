0,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2021,not available,"Prince George, VA ",Nice Little Place!,"Nice little place. Long rickety road to get there. It's in the middle of the woods, up a hill. You check in and pay cash at a little house at the top of the steps. Family owned business. STANK restrooms, so be prepared. Water is nice and warm...likely best enjoyed when the weather is cold/cool. We still enjoyed it in June, but were done before the hour was up. Arrived at opening to avoid crowds. Decent little experience...not the most pristine nor polished, but we were okay."
1,Granite_Hot_Springs2,May 2021,not available,"Collins, GA ","no review for the place - except, no signage to help you know where to turn on US-191","Can't go there is you can't find it. NO road signs, billboards or directional markers on US 191. We couldn't even find, and never saw, any signage for the Iditarod Dog Tours. Wife and I would have gone to the springs, spent the day (and a few dollars), maybe even stayed overnight. People can't come see you fi they don't know hos to get there. GPS was NO help. Get it together, maybe we'll try again if we're in the area."
2,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2021 , Couples,"Pittsford, VT ",Amazinf,This is a must do. The water is a constant 93 degrees in the summer. And 112 in the winter. It’s a concrete pool that contains the hot spring water. The “pool” is drained every night and refilled every morning. It’s so cool!
3,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2021 , Friends, ,Off the beaten path. Very relaxing,An hour or so south of Jackson. Have to travel a bumpy dirt road for about 20-30 minutes to get there. Only suggest during good weather. Cheap tickets ($5 per adult). Was perfect way to relax after a long day. Closes at 7pm in spring/summer. Stayed about an hour and a half. Two of the group ran the Grand Tetons Half Marathon that day and felt fine the next day after a soak.
4,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Mar 2021,not available,"Frisco, TX ","Amazing Views, Hidden Gem Hot Spring","The family and I took a guided snowmobile tour to the granite hot spring. The facility is very well maintained and despite the extremely heavy tourist traffic appears be well preserved. The water temperature did not disappoint and the views were spectacular. A must see on your things to do in Jackson, WY!"
5,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2021,not available, ,Snowmobile ride to the hot springs,This was a great 1/2 day trip. Easy for the entire family. Getting in and out of your swimsuit is pretty easy since the changing rooms are just up the stairs from the hot spring pool
6,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Dec 2020,not available, ,Plan Transportation to Hot Springs Ahead of Time,"As stated on the website, the only way to go to hot springs in the winter is via snowmobile, skiing, or dog sled. We drove from Jackson to go to hot springs assuming there would be some form of transportation to/from the hot springs where the road ends. To our surprise there wasn't. We were told we had to buy tickets Jackson Hole to snowmobile to/from the hot springs. No where does it say that on the site. Please note, if you want to go to hot springs via mode of transportation, plan accordingly before driving an hour to them to find out there is NO ticket sales at point of entrance. It's a beautiful drive though. Enjoy your soak."
7,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Oct 2020 , Couples,"Sioux Falls, SD ",Wonderful hidden gem,Was a fun place to visit! It’s a little bit of a ball down a gravel road but well worth it. Water was about 80ish degrees in October and it was great! We enjoyed the scenery on the way there and while in the pool. Cash only $8 a person I believe and like $4 or $6 for a child. Fun off the way thing that isn’t super touristy. There was only like 8 other people there. Bring your own towel and enjoy!
8,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Oct 2020 , Couples,"Colorado Springs, CO, ","Beautiful, although a tad crowded...","It's a short trek from Jackson to here. Totally worth it. The drive is gorgeous, inexpensive to get in and so relaxing!! Little crowded but was still able to socially distant... Beautiful falls Right down river from the pool."
9,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2020,not available,"Pittsfield, MA ",Great place,"Not much in social distancing but a great place to go. Not as good as the natural rock hot springs but good overall & in a beautiful spot. Make sure you hydrate well before you get in, I did not & was not good after, if you hydrate prior to will be fine."
10,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2020 , Family,"Midland, TX ",Great,It’s a far drive on a rough road but worth it and much closer to Jackson hole than the hot spring in Yellowstone. It was great for families with little kids. It’s not fancy at all so don’t expect that and make sure to pack your own picnic for after your refreshing dip. There’s plenty of picnic spots and a beautiful waterfall on the way.
11,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2020,not available,"Sutter, CA ",Beautiful location,This was a fun trip and the hot springs were so warm and inviting. The road in is a bit bumpy but it is well worth stopping at the falls first then the hot springs.
12,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2020 , Couples, ,Great Venue and Relaxing Hot Springs!,"The 9 mile unimproved road isn’t that big of a deal....even in a Nissan Maxima rental. Average speed is about 20-25 miles an hour and the road has quite a few campsites visible from the road. We arrived around 0945, paid the entry fee in cash, and hopped in the pool; Water temp was about 80-85 degrees; everyone kept to the social distancing requirements. Masks are not required and that was a great thing."
13,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2020 , Family, ,"Rough ride, amazing views and great time","Wasn’t on our plan to visit but turned out to be one of our favorite things we did in Wyoming. Loved the rustic views of nature, hot  Springs felt great and the water fall was impressive."
14,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2020 , Family, ,No mask zone,Went there and was told that this was a no mask area. We could not wear a mask. No signs that said that. We left. Very disappointed. Rude attendant.
15,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2020,not available,"Baltimore, Maryland ","Terrible drive, wonderful visit.","To get to the pool you have to drive 10 miles over some of the worst roads I’ve ever driven on.. took us 45 minutes to go 10 miles. Once we got there however, the pool was beautiful, perfectly warm and uncrowded. The scenery is awesome. If you don’t get motion sick and you have a decent SUV or truck, it’s worth it."
16,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2020,not available,"Houston, TX ",We loved this place!,"We enjoyed a soak in the remote Granite Hot Springs and a picnic lunch afterwards. The views are great and the air is clean. The nine mile long dirt road to get here was a bit rutted and dusty, but worth the drive. The pool was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps back in the 1930's and is fed by a natural hot spring from Granite Creek. The attendant was friendly. There is a change house for men and women. Snacks and sodas are available from the attendant, but I would recommend you pack a picnic lunch. There is also a waterfall you can stop at about a mile from the pool. My wife enjoyed watching a cowboy wrangle some cattle at one of the ranches on the drive in. There is camping available in the canyon. We saw several fly fishermen on the creek.. It's definitely an off the grid location. This would be an awesome snowmobile ride in winter!"
17,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2020 , Family,"Tarpon Springs, FL ",Relaxing soak!,"BUMPY ride for 10 miles, big pot holes and gravel! Breath taking views all the way up and at the spring. Worth the trip!"
18,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2020,not available,"New Orleans, LA ",Unique spot,Not an easy spot to get to but so neat! Unreal how warm the water it. Make sure you have reservations!
19,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2019,not available,"Wellsville, UT ",CAN'T BEAT THE MOUNTAIN FRAGRANCE HERE,"Road is a LONG way in and bumpy. Campground was really nice although the campground host was a little bit of a Warden. I imagine he has to be on top of people because some people do crazy things. The restrooms were super clean. The hot springs are really a treat, albeit expensive for what they are. I wouldn't recommend traveling on this road if it's been raining. Super slick in places with drop offs."
20,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Mar 2020 , Family, ,Fun snowmobile ride,"As long as you don't mind the rude pool attendant it's a fun little trip. It's not that far of a ride and has some good spots to stop and play or just stay on the trail. All was good until we walked up and started to get yelled at by the rude attendant, not very professional especially since we had young children with us. Otherwise it's a good spot to go."
21,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2020,not available,"Marco Island, FL ",Enchanting scenery!,My family enjoyed the experience at Granite Hot Springs while on the Iditarod tour. Our daughter and family enjoyed the warm water but did not care for the changing area. It was dark and very crowded.
22,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Oct 2019,not available,"Dallas, TX ",Off Season Swimming is the best,"We had such a great time on this visit! It was considered off season and we had the pool to ourselves for about an hour. The views are incredible and even though it was about 40 degrees out, the pool was a warm 105 as the sun was setting. We absolutely adore the very funny caretaker and we hope to be back soon."
23,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Oct 2019 , Friends,"Lodi, WI ",Beautiful springs,"Went to the springs on a Tuesday morning right at opening. We had the springs to ourselves. So peaceful. The drive in is beautiful, but prepare yourself for a long bumpy road, I wouldn’t attempt it without an SUV or truck."
24,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Petersburg, IL ",The journey is as good as the destination,"To get to the hot spring you have to get off the main road and drive down a gravel/dirt road. We enjoyed this as much as the hot spring. The scenery is beautiful and there is a large waterfall to stop & look at on the way. The hot spring pool is old and off the grid. Outhouse restrooms, and an empty room for changing (if you are shy you would want to wear your suit there). We went in the morning and really enjoyed the pool. The afternoon got very crowded & we got out of there. There is a pretty good hike from the parking up to the pool but that was enjoyable too. We would do this again."
25,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Chubbuck, ID ",A trip to my favorite place,Got to take a relaxing soak in the pool. Then a beautiful walk by the falls. I still think the sky is more blue there.
26,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2019 , Friends, ,Vacation,Water was just barely 90 degrees. Not exactly hot. Would not go again. Too long of a drive on dirt road. Not worth it for me.
27,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2019,not available,"Cullman, AL ",Perfect on a cool day in the Tetons,"We've stopped here a couple of times and loved it. The water is warmer in the Fall / Winter than in the Spring/Summer due to the snow melt run-off, but I'd recommend it anytime. Road can be a bit rough at times due to the weather and Wyoming's relaxed repair attitude, so be prepared for 9+ miles of bumpy driving. Take cash, no cards accepted. There are basic bathrooms and a changing room at the facility, but not much else. But what do you expect? - it's miles in the middle of nowhere. The views are beautiful from the pool - especially this last time with the snow starting to cap the surrounding mountains."
28,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2019,not available,"Germantown, TN ",One of best memories of our teip,"It was a very warm day, so the hot springs themselves weren’t great, but the drive out there is magnificent. We were glad we had an SUV since most of the road is up paved and bumpy. Note- the sign for the turnoff on the highway is easy to miss, which we did. ☹️"
29,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2019 , Family,"North Battleford, Canada ",Worth the drive,Warm and relaxing. A perfect stop after a day of chilly rafting or to freshen up when camping. Good temperature. The drive is a bit long and winding.
30,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2019 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Jackson Hole sucks tell your friends,This place is down a long bumpy dirty road. At the end of the road is a pool that is warm. Big deal. Go away tourists!!!!!
31,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2019,not available,"Minneapolis, MN ",What a family friendly high alpine hot spring should be,"The setting and experience is what makes a hot spring a good hot spring. This place is certainly off the beaten path but that didn't seem to deter people. It is a very bumpy gravel mountain road to get there on the best of days. Depending on conditions the road may be impassable by regular cars, i.e. 4wd and extra ground clearance may be required. And in winter it is snow machine access only. The temp was pleasant and nicely distributed. There were rivers of warm water at certain places in the pool that created good temps throughout. Some natural rocks built into the hillside walls are a nice touch. Be sure to take a splash in the river!"
32,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2019,not available,"Crystal Lake, IL, United States ",Disappointing,"When I saw the reviews of the dirt road, I thought maybe some were exaggerating the drive. But it was a long slow stressful drive and my rental car was covered in dirt. The pot holes on the road were everywhere so it took a long time to get there. A few days earlier we went to Chico Hot Spring in MT and it was a wonderful experience. The scenery here is beautiful, but the pool was rather small and crowded. There was algae floating everywhere. My teenage son enjoyed it but I wished it was cleaner. I would have been more relaxing to have more time in the pool at the condo."
33,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",Didn't Meet Our Expectations,"The road took way longer than anticipated because of 10 miles on a road you couldn’t even go 20mph on. This won the distinction as the worst road on our trip. I remember reading reviews about the Moose Wilson Road in GTNP being bad, and this road is WAY worse than that. We made the drive fine in our minivan, but I was hoping this hot springs was going to be well worth the terrible drive. It fell short.    We paid about $35 for our family of six to go in the pool. Surprisingly, there were more people than I expected after seeing that road. I would estimate there were about 40-50 people there. There are a girl and boy changing room as well.    This also won the distinction as the part of the trip that didn’t live up to expectations. It kind of just feels like you are in a heated pool. The scenery around is pretty, but because of being in a real pool, it doesn't feel like a hot springs at all. In my mind, it was more like a heated public pool at the end of a dirt road filled with pot holes.    Would I recommend this to someone else? No. We had four cars in our group of 18. Not one of us thought the experience warranted the cost and the drive there. This was the part of the trip that all of us said we could have skipped and felt like we didn't miss anything."
34,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Couples,"New Berlin, NY ",The Granite Hot Springs Area,"We did not go to the Hot Springs, but visited the area around it. Beautiful widlflowers and natural beauty everywhere."
35,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Columbus, OH ","If you have a 1/2 day to spare, go here","So, while researching Jackson, WY, I came across this little place and thought we check it out. We were staying in Teton Village and left about 11:30. We made our way out of town and stopped at THE BIRD to have lunch....this is a must do restaurant. It's hidden off the road, so you need to be looking for it. It had a fantastic menu of burgers, wings, salad and a deck with a view during your meal. Enjoy this, because there's not much between there and the springs. Once you get to the dirt road, it's about a 20 min drive only because it's slow going on the road. If there has been alot of rain, I wouldn't try driving this road, choose a day when it's been dry. The Hot springs is what others have said, it's a pool of hot spring water that the guy there said, is emptied every day and refilled with the hot spring. It enters in very shallow and is about 8 ft at it's deepest. There was about 45 people there while we were in it. There's ONE spot where the springs enter the pool and it's a coveted spot. We just happened to be there with a very lively family, vacationing there from Nepal. They were a joyful delight and they unified the whole pool in song and laughter which made our experience there unique and great fun with stories to come home with. There are changing rooms there, snacks to buy, BRING CASH ($8 per person) and TOWELS and a plastic bag for wet stuff. The water was warm...not too hot, but I think it would get hotter as the season gets warmer. The guy that runs it did say, it gets busier as the summer goes on. So maybe if you're heading there this summer, check it out in the morning when maybe the crowds will be down. This was a fun afternoon chillin in the pool and on our way out we stopped by the waterfall (about a mile down the road) and checked it out. It's a beautiful canyon that you drive into, we were all happy to of done it...if we were going back, I don't think we would return...but we would go back to the Bird for a meal :)"
36,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Family,"Spring Hill, TN ",Not Yellowstone but it’s fun.,We were told due to lots of snowmelt this spring the water would not be as hot as usual. However it was still 93 degrees and we all got in and had a fun time. Normally the water is warmer. We had 7 grandkids aged 10 to 18months and they loved it. The hot springs flows into a concrete pool that they built so it could accommodate people getting in and out.  The last part of your drive is a dirt road for about 10 miles that has a lot of bumps but we just figured it was part of the adventure and it was. If it has been raining there the day you go I would recommend a 4 wheel drive due to the road becoming muddy but we had a 15 passenger van and made it even though it was pretty muddy on our way in.
37,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Family,"Louisville, KY ",Interesting place!,"Warmish hot springs, more like a public pool, but natural (maybe?). Hidden down a 10 mile dirt road but the scenery is beautiful."
38,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Great day trip,This is a good place in a great setting. It’s hard to judge..it could be so much more but then it would be so much more crowded. A ten mile gravel road that is rough but can be traversed by any vehicle in decent weather. Facilities are adequate. The water temp in June was a bit disappointing when you’re used to hot spring pools that are truly hot (102-108). But the coolness allows young kids to spend more time in the water...it was about 91-93. Scenery is stellar!

66,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2019 , Friends, ,Vacation,Water was just barely 90 degrees. Not exactly hot. Would not go again. Too long of a drive on dirt road. Not worth it for me.
67,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2019,not available,"Cullman, AL ",Perfect on a cool day in the Tetons,"We've stopped here a couple of times and loved it. The water is warmer in the Fall / Winter than in the Spring/Summer due to the snow melt run-off, but I'd recommend it anytime. Road can be a bit rough at times due to the weather and Wyoming's relaxed repair attitude, so be prepared for 9+ miles of bumpy driving. Take cash, no cards accepted. There are basic bathrooms and a changing room at the facility, but not much else. But what do you expect? - it's miles in the middle of nowhere. The views are beautiful from the pool - especially this last time with the snow starting to cap the surrounding mountains."

69,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2019 , Family,"North Battleford, Canada ",Worth the drive,Warm and relaxing. A perfect stop after a day of chilly rafting or to freshen up when camping. Good temperature. The drive is a bit long and winding.
70,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2019 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Jackson Hole sucks tell your friends,This place is down a long bumpy dirty road. At the end of the road is a pool that is warm. Big deal. Go away tourists!!!!!
71,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2019,not available,"Minneapolis, MN ",What a family friendly high alpine hot spring should be,"The setting and experience is what makes a hot spring a good hot spring. This place is certainly off the beaten path but that didn't seem to deter people. It is a very bumpy gravel mountain road to get there on the best of days. Depending on conditions the road may be impassable by regular cars, i.e. 4wd and extra ground clearance may be required. And in winter it is snow machine access only. The temp was pleasant and nicely distributed. There were rivers of warm water at certain places in the pool that created good temps throughout. Some natural rocks built into the hillside walls are a nice touch. Be sure to take a splash in the river!"
72,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2019,not available,"Crystal Lake, IL, United States ",Disappointing,"When I saw the reviews of the dirt road, I thought maybe some were exaggerating the drive. But it was a long slow stressful drive and my rental car was covered in dirt. The pot holes on the road were everywhere so it took a long time to get there. A few days earlier we went to Chico Hot Spring in MT and it was a wonderful experience. The scenery here is beautiful, but the pool was rather small and crowded. There was algae floating everywhere. My teenage son enjoyed it but I wished it was cleaner. I would have been more relaxing to have more time in the pool at the condo."
73,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",Didn't Meet Our Expectations,"The road took way longer than anticipated because of 10 miles on a road you couldn’t even go 20mph on. This won the distinction as the worst road on our trip. I remember reading reviews about the Moose Wilson Road in GTNP being bad, and this road is WAY worse than that. We made the drive fine in our minivan, but I was hoping this hot springs was going to be well worth the terrible drive. It fell short.    We paid about $35 for our family of six to go in the pool. Surprisingly, there were more people than I expected after seeing that road. I would estimate there were about 40-50 people there. There are a girl and boy changing room as well.    This also won the distinction as the part of the trip that didn’t live up to expectations. It kind of just feels like you are in a heated pool. The scenery around is pretty, but because of being in a real pool, it doesn't feel like a hot springs at all. In my mind, it was more like a heated public pool at the end of a dirt road filled with pot holes.    Would I recommend this to someone else? No. We had four cars in our group of 18. Not one of us thought the experience warranted the cost and the drive there. This was the part of the trip that all of us said we could have skipped and felt like we didn't miss anything."

75,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Columbus, OH ","If you have a 1/2 day to spare, go here","So, while researching Jackson, WY, I came across this little place and thought we check it out. We were staying in Teton Village and left about 11:30. We made our way out of town and stopped at THE BIRD to have lunch....this is a must do restaurant. It's hidden off the road, so you need to be looking for it. It had a fantastic menu of burgers, wings, salad and a deck with a view during your meal. Enjoy this, because there's not much between there and the springs. Once you get to the dirt road, it's about a 20 min drive only because it's slow going on the road. If there has been alot of rain, I wouldn't try driving this road, choose a day when it's been dry. The Hot springs is what others have said, it's a pool of hot spring water that the guy there said, is emptied every day and refilled with the hot spring. It enters in very shallow and is about 8 ft at it's deepest. There was about 45 people there while we were in it. There's ONE spot where the springs enter the pool and it's a coveted spot. We just happened to be there with a very lively family, vacationing there from Nepal. They were a joyful delight and they unified the whole pool in song and laughter which made our experience there unique and great fun with stories to come home with. There are changing rooms there, snacks to buy, BRING CASH ($8 per person) and TOWELS and a plastic bag for wet stuff. The water was warm...not too hot, but I think it would get hotter as the season gets warmer. The guy that runs it did say, it gets busier as the summer goes on. So maybe if you're heading there this summer, check it out in the morning when maybe the crowds will be down. This was a fun afternoon chillin in the pool and on our way out we stopped by the waterfall (about a mile down the road) and checked it out. It's a beautiful canyon that you drive into, we were all happy to of done it...if we were going back, I don't think we would return...but we would go back to the Bird for a meal :)"
76,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2019 , Family,"Spring Hill, TN ",Not Yellowstone but it’s fun.,We were told due to lots of snowmelt this spring the water would not be as hot as usual. However it was still 93 degrees and we all got in and had a fun time. Normally the water is warmer. We had 7 grandkids aged 10 to 18months and they loved it. The hot springs flows into a concrete pool that they built so it could accommodate people getting in and out.  The last part of your drive is a dirt road for about 10 miles that has a lot of bumps but we just figured it was part of the adventure and it was. If it has been raining there the day you go I would recommend a 4 wheel drive due to the road becoming muddy but we had a 15 passenger van and made it even though it was pretty muddy on our way in.

It’s hard to judge..it could be so much more but then it would be so much more crowded. A ten mile gravel road that is rough but can be traversed by any vehicle in decent weather. Facilities are adequate. The water temp in June was a bit disappointing when you’re used to hot spring pools that are truly hot (102-108). But the coolness allows young kids to spend more time in the water...it was about 91-93. Scenery is stellar!
79,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2018 , Family, ,Disappointed,We have been to Granire Hot Springs in a few occasions before and found the setting to be amazing. This trip was ruined by the attendant who came running down screaming at the top of his lungs to us as we attempted to park in the handicap parking with our van as we had our little daughter in it who is in a wheelchair and completely disabaled. He proceeded to scream at us in front of our children and accused us of speeding and almost running over his dog and parking by his motor home which was parked in the handicap parking without a handicap tag. We debated at that point whether to even go to the pool but decided our children would be upset after driving all that way. The pool visit was okay and the attended seemed to realize he was out of line but unfortunately I was in tears the whole time and it took away from the experience. I don’t know that I would visit again due to this experience.

I recommend Leisure Sports, because they made this happen last minute and it wasn't outrageously priced like the rest of the places in town.    The actual hot springs were something out of a fairy tale. It was snowing, and there were only a handful of other people there. It's not for everyone, as the site amenities are primitive. But you can't beat the experience.    Tips:  Take a towel with you! They don't have any onsite.  Take a plastic bag to put wet suits and towels in when you leave.  Take cash. They do not accept anything else."

Initially we struggled to get the sleds/snowmobiles off the trailer but there were plenty of helpful & competent locals who helped. The 11 mile path to the springs was magical, just like in a picture book. Apparently there were was unseasonably little snow but we enjoyed the 2-3 feet and thought it was plenty for us Floridians. Bring a couple of plastic bags (to stand on and to put your towel & clothes on), bring a picnic, cash and don't forget your camera. The little concession stand is very reasonably priced."

The adult entry fee is $8. There are changing rooms available but remember to bring your own own towels.    The temperature of the pool varies from hot tub type temperatures (~100 deg-F ) where the spring water feeds into the pool to milder (~90 deg-F) temperatures where the spring exits the pool. The depth of the pool varies from a few feet to over 6 feet at the spring exit. There are also restrooms and picnic tables in the area for public use.    Just be aware that the 10 mile trip on the entry road from the main road to the pool is a moderately maintained dirt road.

This is one of the coolest places and a definite highlight of our two week trip. Our 11 year old wanted to swim in a hot spring and here is the perfect one nestled on the side of a mountain. Someone who used to be local told us that there is another spring at the base of the waterfall down the road. We didn’t have time to explore that, but will next time.    Key Info: You have to drive about 9 miles on a rough dirt road to get there, but it’s worth it. The actual parking is in an opening and then you walk down a gravel drive. There is a small parking spot for handicap a little further down the drive from the main parking area, but you are still walking the gravel drive up to the pool. I think this is a cash only operation, so bring the green stuff. Prices were reasonable too."

The rode is unpaved but it's a solid dirt/gravel surface and even though it was wet, if you drive at a reasonable speed, there's no problem. Best to leave the sports car at home, since dust and mud are sure bets.  The hot spring pool isn't large but it's well-maintained. Rubber mats are provided at the entry steps and around the pool but it's not a bad idea to wear water shoes because the bottom surface is slippery.The temperature is posted where you pay the entry fee ($8 per person). Fed naturally by a hot spring in mountain, the temperatures vary from cold to wonderfully warm; the closer you get to the source, what's called the pond, the warmer it is. So relaxing and it helped that it wasn't crowded.  Changing rooms and toilets are on site. You can't eat or drink poolside but there are picnic tables nearby.  As soon as you access Granite Creek Road, take a look at the confluence of the warm, blue water of the Granite Creek and the muddy Hoback River: they run parallel to each other--it's the coolest thing!"

116,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2017 , Couples, ,Granite Hot Spring is A 5-star Secret,"The only reason I’m giving this a 4-star review is because I’m trying not to reveal a 5-star secret. Granite Hot Springs is tucked back in a valley within Gros Ventre Wilderness of the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Along the 9-mile gravel trail to the hot spring location, there are both free and premium campsites, trails, and lodging.    This valley is absolutely stunning! Once you arrive at the Hot Spring Pool, you’re surrounded by four mountain peaks. During this visit to Wyoming, wild fires were rampant in the Pacific Northwest and Montana — causing poor visibility throughout most parts of Northwestern Wyoming. This location was an exception. As a remote valley with high peaks surrounding all sides, the clarity was substantially better than other nearby areas.    Note that the main attraction here is a hot spring pool, not an entirely natural wading area. It’s actually a really nice balance of rustically peaceful with amenities. Any more developed, and it could start feeling a little bit like an amusement park. For folks who are seeking a more scenic hot spring, it was rumored amongst other guests that of a hot spring along the nearby waterfall a short walk from the pool.    If you’re planning a visit to the Granite Hot Springs, regardless of season, consider that the road in is very slow, windy, and upaved. If you’re traveling from Jackson, it’ll take just over an hour each way – so consider a few other outdoor activities within the Gros Ventre Wilderness to make it worth your precious time. All, in all, this is one of the best finds near Jackson, WY."

The 30 minutes dirt ride wasn't too bad either because you got the rustic experience from being in wild Wyoming. The first thing that I didn't really care for about this place was the looks of the springs (definitely made you feel like you were at an awfully dirty public pool). The next disappointing part of the spring was that it wasn't very warm, and I was hoping to use the springs as a therapeutic relief. I was also a little concerned that perhaps I was swimming in a bunch of sewage as with a natural springs area and with tons of children in the pool (no offense). I wouldn't go back to visit the springs to swim but the views were beautiful!"
118,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2017 , Family,"Missoula, MT ","The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (Not)","I’m going to list the negatives first, so people bothered by these things can just quit reading and scratch Granite Hot Springs off their list. More adventurous souls who enjoy off the beaten path rustic venues can skip to the section of positives.    NEGATIVES;  In the summer the water is warm not hot. In the early summer it is even cooler because of runoff and seasonal groundwater, along with cooler air temps. It was pleasant in August but not the intense heat usually associated with hot springs.    It is a long drive on a rough narrow gravel road (10 miles at maybe 15 mph). Clouds of dust with each passing car. Hard to judge depth of potholes until you’re right on them. If you are familiar with this sort of driving in the remote west, you’ll be fine. However, if you have reservations, best to avoid it.    Maintenance on the pool has not been kept up. There are sections of slippery algae in the pool, paint is peeling, concrete is cracked. There are dead and live bugs in the water.    The dressing rooms have no exterior door, just an entry baffle, and there are no partitions or dressing rooms inside, just benches and hooks in a room about 12’ by 12’    They only accept cash, no credit cards and I'm pretty sure no checks.    POSITIVES:  That 10 mile dusty, bumpy, potholed drive is gorgeous! Not many other cars.    This is a unique hot springs where a concrete pool was created in a natural setting, using existing rock faces for part of the pool.    Although the pool is not hot like a typical hot spring, it is a very pleasant temperature for a long soak on a warm summer day (at 7000’ elev). You can get close to where the hot water enters for a little boost in temp, but there’s only room for 2 or maybe 3 people at a time and it's still not as hot as most hot springs. It was not a problem to get a turn when we were there, people rotated in and out.    Part of the pool is shaded so you can avoid sunscreen if you wish.    It was an inspiration for me to see this project that was created by the CCC in the Great Depression. Our country thought this was a worthy use of public funds in the goal of creating jobs. They created something that is bringing in people, money, and enjoyment 84 years later! I am sorry that obviously the maintenance budget has been cut.

The pool was very cool when we visited in June, but they did warn us before we paid the entrance fee. Very primitive facilities may put some people off. Probably a better venue in winter."

124,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2017 , Friends,"Madison, WI ",NOT A SUMMER ACTIVITY,"We were sorely disappointed with the ""hot"" springs. Do not go here in the summer. We went on a cool morning, thinking it would be fun to enjoy a hot springs when the weather was a bit cooler. The water was lukewarm at best. In my opinion they ruin the natural hot springs experience by trying to make it look like a pool. The corner where the hot water comes in was slightly warm, but the rest of the pool was cool- not inviting on a cool morning. The drive out was on a gravel road and took about a half hour to get 10 miles. The scenery isn't more than you would see anywhere else on the outskirts of Jackson. It was not worth the drive.  The only time you could ever convince me to return would be in the winter as part of a snowmobile trip - MAYBE."
125,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2017 , Family,"Overland Park, KS ","Hot springs pool was fun, but not the best.","The gentleman was very nice at the hot springs. The pool is quite run down (it was a 1930's works project). But it's a good stop. Be aware that the drive up to the campground and pool is long and rugged. If you're a person who likes away from people, this is a good stop. You can also camp anywhere on the road up to campground.    If you're scared of getting your car dirty and are in a hurry, don't bother. We were in a 15 passenger van with trailer, went slow it were fine.    Camp ground is primitive, with pit toilets (one of which was closed). But make sure to hike from campground to the waterfall, it's quite scenic, especially if you're lucky enough to be there when the flowers were in bloom."

Don't even waste your time, energy, effort, and wear and tear on your car to drive the horrible road and visit this horrible site. The water wasn't even warm, let alone hot! Very disappointed to say the least."
127,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2017 , Family,florida ,Not what we expected!,I'm giving this 2 stars because the 10 mile dirt road drive was very scenic..... but the disappointment was the actual pool and its unkept surroundings. Ughhhhh what a shame.

The last 10 miles of the trip are on sub par roads...so be prepared to bump along slowly...but we all felt the destination was worth it...we brought a picnic lunch, and enjoyed sotting in the warm sun above the river..looking out on snow capped mountains.  Only 2 in our party actuality went for a dip, as the heat of the hotsprings pool had been diluted by spring run off, and temps were only in the low 80's....but still very beautiful and unusual spot."

It would be great fun for a polar bear, but we froze. In defense of the Hot Springs, there was a record snow fall that was melting and running off, which made it much colder. If your going to visit, go in the winter or later in the summer."
131,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2017 , Family,"Lander, Wyoming ",Great spot for kids,"My daughters and I headed up here after our rafting trip got postponed due to high water. It had only been open a week when we visited. It is a rustic place and if you are looking for 5 star amenities, please go back to Jackson! Yes, you have to drive a dirt road to get there, but my Honda Civic, loaded with camping stuff, made it no problem. The only people who complain about the road have obviously never driven on a dirt road before. We were told that the water was cooler than normal since it was high water, but it was 85 degrees and it felt nice in the searing sun. It got busy, people laying out everywhere and kids splashing around, but everyone seemed to be having a great time. There is a nice forest service campground maybe a half mile away and the granite creek falls were awesome during high water!"
132,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Salt Lake City, UT, ",Winter time visit was everything I hoped it would be,"We hit this at the perfect time. Jackson had had record snow, it had been stormy and cloudy. The trailhead had been closed to clear the parking area. But our tour of eight snowmobiles arrived just as they were finishing and we were the only ones there for half a day. The snowmobile trip in was just fun. Beautiful country. We saw some moose. The new fallen snow on the trees was picture perfect. Blue sky all the way. The 11 miles went quickly and we were soon at the springs. There was no rush to hurry us out as we had booked the full day. Most everyone was ready after about an hour or hour and a half. The water was warm,,,warmest by the inlet. I was surprised how big the pool was, though it would fill up quickly with the 100 people they say sometimes show up. The changing rooms are wide open with some benches along the outside walls. Definitely wear your swimsuit on the way in and it will cut down the time to get in the water.    We had lunch on the tables right there and then went off for some more fun. We went first to the falls, and then to an open meadow where we could throttle up the snowmobiles and get some powder runs in.    Overall an amazing day. It was something I'd wanted to do for a long time and it certainly lived up to my expectations."

Also I would suggest dogsledding for the half-day lunchtime ride it's absolute credible . I would suggest only going in the hot springs that you have to pay for the other Hidden Hot Springs by the falls could have contaminants that you don't want to attract
136,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2016 , Family, ,"Attraction is Okay During Summer, Surrounding Area More Exciting","During the summer, while the springs are still nice to enjoy since it is still somewhat cold there, there isn't much to enjoy there. The springs are essentially a heated up pool to sit in and really don't excite much. The real gem of the area is the surrounding area. On the drive to the springs small waterfalls and streams with the backdrop of the mountains are wonderful sights and in the summer, to cross the fast stream and find the small natural hot pools hidden nearby is far more fun."

We went 2/27 and it was amazing. You have to enter the road to parking area about 30 minute drive into the Hoback Canyon. A few pointers. The road leading into the parking is a bumpy single lane road, go slow and may be worth having someone walk ahead you would not want to back the trailer out👹. The fun part, ride sleds directly straight ahead out of parking lot into trail if you wish to hit Hot Springs. The distance is 8.9 miles and you go straight until you hit parking area for Hot Spring up to your right across besutiful bridge. There is a log hut that has his and hers changing rooms $6 per person paid in center of hut is rangers window to pay. The hot spring pool is fed by a small stream that's 105 degrees and big enough to spread out. There are also rest rooms on lower building on way to bridge. This is a life event, the snow was 6+ feet with spectacular views surrounding, just amazing 😉"

Be warned that the drive is a very long, bumpy dirt road (7 miles maybe?), but definitely worth it. When we arrived, we paid a few dollars per person and were directed to the changing rooms (one for men, one for women. The women's was essentially one open room with lockers, not much privacy. And they were not heated, so quite cold when I got out of the pool in Oct.). The pool/hotspring was so clear and the perfect temperature and you could actually choose if you wanted it a little bit hotter or cooler depending on which end of the pool you went too. I thought it would stink like sulfur, but it actually was fine. There was what looked like a boyscout or boys club group and some russian or german tourists besides us, but not too crowded. My only complaint is that we only stayed about 30 minutes because we had to be somewhere else!"

Getting there is an adventure and a 4WD vehicle is recommended -- the last 10 miles is on dirt road. The facility was built in the 1930's and it gives you that feel...Changing rooms and outhouse are rustic, but worth tolerating for the experience, especially on a cold fall or winter day."
150,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Oct 2016 , Solo,"Jackson, WY ",great place to soak on a cool day,"This is a local gem, and although it takes some time to get in here, it's totally worth it. I went on a day where it had been raining the previous two, so the dirt road (Granite Creek Road, 10 miles of dirt road) was very muddy, full of holes and slippery. I took it slow in 4WD and had no issues, but I imagine after heavy rain this road would be challenging. Be aware that after rain, a 2WD will probably not get you in (or it will, but you won't get out)    Once you get to the hot springs and make your way through the mud, you pay $6/adult to soak from 10–6 pm. It has snowed recently so it was absolutely delightful to lie back in the warm water and look at the snow covered peaks surrounding the pool.    A secluded hideaway in the forest. A perfect retreat."

The drive from Jackson (about an hour) is beautiful and the ride along the Hobak river is almost worth the journey alone. We hit the area at peak ""leaf"" viewing time that added to a most pleasant couple of hours.    At about the nine mile mark on the dirt road the falls can be seen off the the right along with a parking area...note, some deep ruts around.  Park there and walk a couple hundred yards to the falls base for some great shots. One of few falls where you can be right at the base with falls directly and close behind.  Scamper up another 100 yards or so to the top of the falls and climb down a 6' granite wall (plenty of stepping off areas) to enjoy the up steam area and cascades.  Almost as pretty as the falls themselves.  Both areas should not be over-looked.  We did go up to take a look at the hot-springs but didn't get in. Everyone there was enjoying themselves."

At the end a heaven awaits. The experience of soaking in hot spring water surrounded by wooded hills is indeed special. The changing rooms and restrooms are spotless. Bring your own towels, food and drink, picnic tables are provided.  Time permitting take a one hr slow walk along the river to the waterfall (the track can be slippery in wet weather). This waterfall can also be seen from the road in your way to Granite Hot Spring."

Both my husband and I are ""seniors"" and not particularly agile. However, we loved the drive up to the Falls where we surprised ourselves by getting out of the car and hiking down to the falls for the wonderful view. We made use of our Trek Poles and had a fine time. We then continued driving on up to the Hot Spring where we were delighted to find several outdoor picnic tables scattered about. We had taken the advice found here and brought along a picnic lunch to enjoy. The highlight was when we spotted a large deer standing right in the middle of the river just taking his time to cross. We did not find the road hard to navigate until the last several miles before reaching the hot spring. Just curvy, bumpy, and narrow for a short portion."

We stayed at the campsite a mile away and fell in love with the Spring. It was hotter than expected and almost too warm in the day but head up in the evening once the rain picks up and it's perfect. We found it quite quiet throughout the day. Highly recommend if you're in the Jackson area and looking for something a bit different. There are an amazing set of falls on the way up to springs that are worth visiting as well!

Please note when driving it you will be on 10 miles of dirt and gravel road and is not easy. However, the spring itself is something to experience. You can see the water coming down the mountain emptying into the pool which looks cool and refreshing.

Granite hot springs is not fancy by any stretch of the imagination, but it is surrounded by Amazing natural beauty. The hot spring pool itself is decent. It only cost $6. to go in. The temp of the pool was about 99 degrees on the day we were there. There were quite a few families with kids. But the best part of the hot springs were outside the pool area. There are the Granite Falls which was a highlight on our trip to Wyoming. There is also a hiking trail that starts just outside the entrance of the pool that looks down on the falls and Granite creek.

The pool itself is okay, but the scenery was beautiful. Would be good to have swim shoes because it is a little slippery. If you are modest, plan ahead and bring a sheet to help you keep covered while you change. Their changing room is just that... a room. No dividers. There were 3 other ladies in there changing when I was in there. We all commented on how awkward we felt. But, thankfully, I had a big sheet so I was fine.

Clean, beautifully located, and very basic it gives you the pleasure to swim in perfect thermal water surrounded by a gorgeous forest. Note that the place is not fancy, it has one big communal changing room, and a clean chemical toilet. Very important: the road to the hot spring is not paved, so don't attempt to drive there if you are not driving a 4x4, or SUV or a car that can take an hour of rough mountain road."

The dirt road was really rough as it had not been graded yet after the winter thaw. The scenery near the spring was beautiful but the spring itself is a little disappointing if you are expecting a more rustic waterhole. It does look like a cheap pool but the water was very nice so if you are not expecting a lot this is a nice stop.

Be aware that it will take you about an hour from Jackson (and the last 30 minutes are on a dirt road). That being said, the drive offers views of the mountains and surrounding area that you can't get elsewhere! It was so beautiful that we were a bit disappointed with the hot springs themselves. We paid $6/person, and it was crowded with kids - my sister was hit in the head by a pool toy. And on a summer day, the hot water was less than ideal. You can't bring food or drink into the pool area, but we stayed for awhile on a picnic table to enjoy the scenery. Stop by the waterfall either on the way there or the way back!"
175,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2016 , Family,New Jersey ,The drive itself is worth it,"This was a beautiful drive along the unpaved road to the hot springs. We stopped at the waterfall along the way, and it was beautiful. The ""hot springs"" is really a pool fed by hot springs, but the surroundings are just amazing and worth the effort to get there. We didn't realize that it was cash only, which was fine, but thankfully we were prepared just in case."
176,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2016 , Family,"Jackson, WY, ",Delightful!,"After reading some negative reviews I felt things should be clarified. It is true it's only open on weekends during certain times of the year and it's true phone calls will probably not be returned. But to say it is not a genuine hot spring but only a pool such as in a motel is misleading. It is indeed natural hot spring water with no additional chemicals which is channeled into a pool built by the CCC in 1933. For those who prefer a wild spring, a little research should show this one has been tamed somewhat and the minimal facilities here have long been known and advised of. But there is a wild hot spring less than a kilometer downstream on the far shore of granite creek at the base of granite falls. At high water such as right now there is far too much cold water washing over the soaking pool to allow experiencing it. This is common with wild hot springs such as the boiling River in Yellowstone. Some are quite seasonal and some have dried up or been made unusable over time after having been published in books. This is the strength of travelers experiences published here and elsewhere: we can communicate what is actually available so that the arriving traveler can be knowledgable.  This is a popular place, winter and summer. It will require almost an hour drive from Jackson and the last 17 km will be dirt. In winter only over-snow access is possible.  We are big hot spring fans.  We just got back from Granite. We find it delightful."
177,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2016 , Solo,"Peoria, IL ",Great diversion from Jackson Hole,"What a great place. The coordinates on the profile page are not where this is located. Take 189 South from Jackson for about 20 miles (go through the round about and take the turn at the 9:00 position - which is about 11 miles south of Jackson). You will then see a sign on the left for the Granite area and swimming pool - turn left there. At this point, you'll be on a narrow dirt road for 10 miles. Hope you don't get behind a couple of very capable SUV's like I did - they went a whopping 8 MPH.    At the end of the road is the Granite Springs swimming pool. It's really neat in its rustic charm. Built in 1922 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the hot springs feeds into the pool and on the opposite side is an opening leading to a schluse way where the water flows out of the pool. There is no chlorine or salt - since the water turns over so frequently, it's always clean, albeit with a bit of algae.    It cost $6.00 for each adult to us, but I'd recommend it. It's quiet, great for families or couples and an easy way to relax, nestled amongst the mountains and pine trees."

184,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Feb 2016 , Family,"Davenport, Iowa ",relaxing time at hot springs,Stopped at hot springs during snowmobile tour. Clean place to change but a but chilly in February. Pool was mostly clean except for some moss/algae like stuff near the hot tub part of the pool where hot spring water comes in. Snow melt cools off the water in the pool so it is warm and not HOT. Relaxing time and great view. Would do it again.
185,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Magnolia, AR ",To Granite Hot Springs by dog sled,"Granite Hot Springs is absolutely picture perfect in the winter! It was a winter wonderland. We traveled by dog sled, which was a great adventure. We wore our swimsuits under all of our layers of warm clothing. Bring a towel and dip flops. They have rooms to change in. The only uncomfortable issue is NO heat! But knowing that ahead of time prepares you for that mind set. The hot springs pool was the highlight of our day! If you have an opportunity to soak, don't miss it! The water is around 100 degrees. We soaked for one hour. We were so refreshed and warm to head back to the headquarters."
186,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Pocatello, Idaho, United States ",Fun place to visit,"If you think you have a personal cubicle to change into your swimsuit, think again. The changing room is cramped and everybody undresses in front of everybody. So those with self esteem issues should probably get dressed before coming. The hot spring is nice and the water is constantly filling/emptying. I believe the cost was $6 per person. The trail to the pool is rocky and a 4x4 vehicle or SUV is preferred."
187,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2016 , Couples,"Nashville, Tennessee ",A Gem in the Tetons!,"We visited the Granite Hot Springs during a dog sled ride in January. Obviously, it was winter, and the site was uncrowded. There were a few snow mobiles; however, the area was snow-covered and quite peaceful. There is a small restroom at the entrance, and dressing rooms adjacent to the springs. The dressing area is a single room and unheated. If you have modesty issues, wear your bathing suit under your clothing. Also take a towel, or you can rent one there for $2. If you visit in the winter, beware that you will need to navigate several steps, so wear appropriate footwear for icy conditions. It was freezing cold (10 - 15 degrees) during our visit. The steam rising from the springs condensed and froze on the surrounding trees and rocks. It was truly a winter wonderland. The springs have a cement floor, so no worries about rocks, etc. The ""deep"" end measures about 6 ft; however, it is marked and roped for safety. Trust me, if you visit during the winter--either by snow mobile or dog sled--- you will appreciate the warm, soothing water from the springs. It was a magical experience to bathe in the warm water while surrounded by snow and ice. Wish we could have stayed longer."
188,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Dec 2015 , Family,"Fisherville, KY ",absolutely beautiful!,We snowmobiled to the springs. We went through what looked like a winter wonderland. We passed dogsled teams and cross country skiers. Beautiful snow scenery and then arrived at the springs. I almost didn't get in because of the cold weather. There is a small dressing room that is up a few stairs. The dressing room needs more hooks on the wall to hang your winter gear on so it doesn't get wet. But once you get in the hot springs....awwwww! So glad I did it. It felt amazing. Fun time with my family and makes for great pictures too!
189,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Feb 2015 , Family,"Jackson, WY, ",A treat!,"This time of the year, 9.5 miles of snow-covered dirt road is accessed only by snowmobiles dogsleds or cross-country skis or snowshoes. Please talk to your front desk about who will pick you up and take you to the mouth of Granite Canyon! There is a primitive Hot Spring at the base of Granite Falls typically accessible after a tricky river crossing from July on, but the developed pool built by the CCC in the early 1930s at the end of the road is a joy summer or winter. Soaking under the towering summit of the open door peak, in the middle of the lesser-known national forest solitude, with no chlorine in the natural hot water, this place is a far cry from the ski resorts and the national parks. It is outstanding."

191,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2015 , Couples,"San Diego, CA ",Granite Creek Campground – Gotta Be The Only NFS Campground with a Hot Tub!,"Beautiful NFS campground, just over 8 miles off of Hwy 189. The dirt road can get rough with a lot of washboarding and pot holes, but it is worth the drive. We did it in a 23 foot Class A motorhome and had no problem.    The campground is adjacent to Granite Creek. It was soothing to listen to the creek at night. About 2/3 of the sites are in a pine forest; The remainder being more in the open. Sites are not very level, but nice overall. We had no problem with our 23 footer, but there are limited sites that could take something much bigger.    About a mile further up the road is Granite Hot Springs, a naturally heated pool originally built by the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) in 1933. What a relaxing way to spend an afternoon after a morning hike. There is a $6 charge for use of the pool.    We camped here in late September. There were only two other campsites (of 51) in use, in addition to the Camp Host. This campground has a later season than many in the area...many of the other NFS campsites had already closed for the season."
192,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2015 , Friends,"Duluth, GA ","Considering the drive, nothing special","Four of us spent a couple of hours in a car trying to find this place. If we had checked the USDA website, we would have realized just how far the springs were from Jackson and that much of the drive was along a bumpy Forest Service road. The drive would have been scenic if the weather had been good; on a gloomy, rainy afternoon it was not a pleasant drive. And it was several minutes' walk from the parking area to the springs--also not fun on a rainy day.    Compared to other hot springs I've visited, I was not impressed with this one, and did not think it was worth the trouble. The $6 entry fee was not unexpected, but the $2 towel rental was. The changing room was a cramped, unlit plywood cubicle with wall hooks and no lockers--unless you are a trusting soul you should either leave your valuables in the car or carry them with you to the spring. The spring itself (a manmade pool) was adequately sized for the few people there that day but I don't think it could accommodate a crowd. The water was unevenly heated, and I found myself constantly in motion to follow the ever-shifting hot spots: the only place that was consistently hot was where the spring itself entered the pool. There was no roof, awning or other shelter from the elements, which made getting in and out in a cold rain unpleasant.    All in all, I did not enjoy the experience. However, in fairness the three people I was with were fine with it, and my overall rating takes that into account. However, I strongly recommend you do not come in bad weather.."

Don't be afraid of the road.... as long as you're not in a low slung Porsche you will be fine. The admission fee is $6.00 to this National Forest facility and you will have a clean changing room and a pool that is fed by the Granite Hot Creek. In the summer the temp is about high 90's.... warm enough to stay in for an hour before getting light-headed. Hotter in the winter when you can get here by snowmobile, snow cat or dogsled!

The road in is very dirt and very bumpy especially at the end of summer. It is about 10 miles in to the hot springs but worth the drive when you get there. We thought about driving a fifth wheel in and camping but glad we didnt because of the road, although we did see many smaller trailers and even some large fifth wheels in the area. The falls are beautiful and the swimming pool is nice but it was very busy on Labor Day weekend when we visited! There is a very small fee to swim (I think around $6), but no fee to drive in and see the falls."

The hot springs flow into a man made pool which is not huge and can get crowded. The water temperature is lovely and the view is excellent, but the springs are quite a ways from town.

196,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Blackwood, NJ ",Just a wonderfully hidden gem.,"We stayed here for two nights in a campground that was quiet and an incredible view. It was clean. Bear boxes are provided. There are outhouses regularly spaced so you don't have to wander far.    We were here mid-week, so I'm guessing that's why it was so sparsely populated. I am an artist and the view from our campsite was perfect--so I painted it.    But the real gem was Granite Hot Springs. It is a walk across a creek, but the younger people seemed to not be as ""careful"" as me (I'm 53) and my husband (58). Once we made it across the creek, the hot spring was glorious.    There were three other people there and we spent a few hours discussing life, location, and our careers. I had a wonderful time and wished them happy journeys.    You get to this location on an approximate 11 mile dirt road, which is actually in better shape than the paved roads in the northeast where I live. The view on this dirty road is amazing--you can take 100 pictures on this road. There are other camp sites that come up that are simply divine, right along the river.    If you're in the Gros Ventre area, or the Jackson/Hoback Junction area, stop here. You won't regret it."

201,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2015 , Solo,Columbia ,Unique and wonderful experience!,"Yes, the gravel road has some ruts, bumps, and potholes, but is quite passable when dry. I used the advanced driving techniques of Slowing Down and Paying Attention. It is necessary – for those of us who do not have 4x4s – to go very slow, 10 to 15 mph through most of it. A few sections require walking speed. The good news is, this is some of the most beautiful scenery you could hope for. A lush valley with a winding stream leads your eye to towering alpine peaks, or stands of magnificent spruces. Take your time, and enjoy the ride!    The pool itself is also awesome. It includes boulders that were incorporated into the design. You can sit on them while you have your soak. There are amazing views in almost every direction. How many places are there that let you gaze on mountain peaks and majestic rock outcroppings while you relax in a hot bath?    In the summer, water temperatures are not kept very high. Pool entry spares you the borderline painful experience sometimes found in a hot tub. It's just warm enough to be cozy and relaxing. I had a great time here, and recommend it highly. As an added bonus, it only costs $6.00."

We paid the nominal entrance fee and stepped into the warm water and it was great. We spent at least a couple hours (lost track of time) and eventually the sun came out and we were hungry, so we left...    It was busy, but not too busy that you didn't have any space. The pool was clean, only a little algae near where the hot water flows out of the rocks, but nothing that bothered me.    There are restrooms there, like you see in most national or state parks, and changing rooms (no lockers).    Go, you will love it if you enjoy warm water. Only the faintest hint of sulphur or minerals for a moment when I first went into the hottest area, but otherwise, I didn't smell a thing, and no afters-smell on my skin.

I am so glad we made the long (yet beautiful) drive up. We even got to see a bald eagle! There weren't many people there which is good because it isn't very big, but big enough so that everyone had room to lounge about. The area to the north of the pool is pretty grimey, but it's natural grime so it isn't a big deal.

Because its natural you can sit in different places in the pool to be at different temps which was nice. The pool has a bit of moss on the bottom and is slick in places. There were lots of kids which I wasn't expecting. No dogs or alcohol are allowed but I would pack a lunch to eat at on of the picnic tables around the Spring.

The vistas are gorgeous and it's just far enough to make you glad to have arrived at the springs freezing and in need of relief. Given that there are many snowmobiling and dogsledding outfitters on the same trail, you will not likely see much animal life. Took some lovely pics around the springs and ""pool"", but my family found the changing cabin dark, cold and terribly small for any more than 8 people. In fact, several men I spoke to said standing body to body in those conditions was bordering on creepy. Might help if solar cells I spotted on roof were used to power better lighting and geothermal kept the rooms less damp and cold. Pool was functional and not flashy - if you're looking for slate and tile, go to the spa at the Four Seasons! Worth doing either way."

Granite is a natural hot springs 13 miles back down a dirt road in the summer and nice sled ride in the winter. Parking is hard in the winter with commercial tour operators having huge trailers. Don't park on the highway! You can get towed.    Find a spot and dress warm for a nice ride back. There are powder fields, trees and trails. Don't go too close to the river and if you are on a commercial trip, follow your guides instructions.    Stop at the wide falls down the hill for a beautiful view both in summer and winter.    Granite has newer changing rooms but bring a plastic bag to keep your clothes dry and safe. The stairs down get slipper as does the way into the spring so use caution in winter. The spring is now a small concrete pool, not fancy but the water is hot and surrounds remind that you are in God's country.    To avoid the crowds go first thing or set in around 1pm. Make sure you get out before sunset and give time to load up your sled and head home.    I like that this is rated low. It gets crowded enough already."

Beautiful Mountain views and hot spring water spilling out of the hillside into a 3/4 round U.S. Corp Of Engineers made soaking pool with wonderful views of nature at its finest. There is a park attendant, $8 all day fee, A clean pit bathroom, changing room & picnic tables. Allow 1/2 day for this off-paved trip and take your time at this very REFRESHING & SPECIAL local attraction. (Usually not crowded) Water shoes helpful partial rock floor in pool. AGAIN, I suggest you phone before you go to be sure it is open."
237,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2014 , Couples,US ,A sweet spot,"Worth the 9 miles of dirt road to get here. We went to the undeveloped springs near the waterfall. WE had to cross a cold creek to access the hot pools. It was worth it! Watch for your turn off the main road, it is easy to miss."
238,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Spring Creek, NV ",Very Unhappy,"Just drove from montana to end our summer with a dip in Granite. Drove rough road to get there only to find it closed. We had seen signs (and web site) that said. Opened on the 20th, The lady that was swimming in the pool, said ,Sorry only opened on the weekends . We could of saved 400 miles travel time and $250.00 in gas if someone would have returned my phone call :("
239,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2014 , Couples,"Olympia, WA ","Pleasant soak, amazing view","At the end of the road up Granite Creek is this gem of a hotspring. The water is collected into a nice pool with deep and shallow areas. The closer to the inlet, the warmer the water. Always comfortable. The view of the surrounding mountains is the frosting on the cake. Was not very crowded but I can see how it could get really busy. Family friendly so expect children."

Back then, it was Jackson's best kept secret. You could go and pretty much have the place to yourself. Now, it's all other the internet...Jackson's 5th best attraction!!!!! It's blogged and tweeted all over. But, it's still worth the trip. There's a very nice campground just a mile before you get to the pool."
241,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2014 , Couples,"Appleton, WI ",Surprise!,"We just happened to stumble onto the turnoff for the hot springs. Beautiful 10 mile ride on a dirt road. We thought we would be the only one's going to this place, I was wrong. Quite a few other adventurers going in this direction. When we finally got there I was surprised it was a pool! I was just amazed that it was constructed in 1933! Lots of hiking trails and a waterfall around this area also. We would definitely go back again. There is a fee to use the hot springs of $6.00 for adults."
242,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2014 , Couples,"West Creek, NJ ",Worth the trip!,"We got lost trying to find the turnoff for Granite Hot Springs, but finally found it.

243,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2014 , Friends,"Atlanta, GA ","Way Out in the Middle of Nowhere, but Awesome!","We did the drive out there in a rental car Chevy sedan and no issues with the road. We traveled on it, just as it opened for spring season and it was fine. It is a dirt road and you have to go slowly, but it is easy to drive. And, there was a ton of wildlife to see along the way.    The hot springs itself were refreshing and well worth the trek. I would not let the negative reviews of the road keep you from this hidden gem."
244,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2014 , Family,"Brenham, TX ",Disappointed Day drive,"After reading the reviews, we planned to visit this place...which is out in the bunnies. Driving a narrow dirt road and finally getting to a glorified warm swimming pool. Yes, I said POOL. You share your space with other pool goers. The 'hot spring' is flowing from the side of a hill into the pool. It is a very small spring coming into a small area of the pool which is occupied with lots of dedicated adults. We were so disappointed, that only 2 of us went in. Did I mention, they charge for admittance? I went in the pool for no more than 10 minutes. It was not hot at all!. Save your time and money...go to Mammoth Hot Springs! Its free and great!"
245,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2014 , Couples,"Kitchener, Canada ",It was okay...,"I was a little disappointed, but it was still a good experience. Some people said that you need a truck to get back there. We have a low riding sedan, and we made it. But you had to drive super slow, so you didn't bottom out in the potholes which made the 10 mile journey down the dirt road seem a lot longer then if you had a pickup truck. We are natural hot spring lovers. This was pretty natural. You could see the hot water coming out from the rocks and into the pool, so that part was neat. However, the pool was quite mossy in certain ares. Also, we thought the water temperature was on the cool side. They say it was 93 degrees - we prefer at least 96. The scenery is beautiful along the road way, so it doesn't seem like such a long trip. I have posted a picture of the gravel road and also the sign off the main highway, so you can find it easily. It is off US 191 - 12 miles south of the Hoback Junction, which is listed on the Wyoming tour maps.. I did not get pictures of the pool, because I left my camera in the car, however, the pictures posted on this website don't show the mossy areas in the pool. Overall, it was a good experience, if you have the time. We much preferred the Boiling River in Yellowstone Park, which I will review as well."
246,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2014 , Couples,"East Liverpool, OH ",What an amazing place to hang out for a few hours!,"What a great place! We had heard of the challenge getting here but it is well worth every bump, dusty turn, and minute it takes to drive back the approx. 11 mile road to get to the springs. When you arrive, the parking lot is small and was fairly full but we were able to park and walk a short distance to the man made pool that catches hot springs water flowing down from the nearby rocky hillside. Very non-private dressing rooms and a small fee to enter pool area. One of the first construction projects of the CCC in 1933, this place is fairly quiet, warm, and a great place to relax. The view from the pool area is beautiful all around and there is a wonderful waterfall just downstream worth seeing!"
247,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2013 , Couples,"Dunedin, FL, ",Wonderful but a bit of a drive,It's a bit of an unnerving drive down a narrow 10 mile gravel road to get to the springs but they are a treat when you get there. There is a short walk from a gravel parking lot that goes past a quaint barn and over a stream that is very photogenic. In retrospect I would have planned a hike on a local trail and a picnic to make the journey worth while again. The springs are very relaxing and the people who run it are very informative characters. Plan a half day to the area and check out the surroundings and make the most of it.
248,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2014 , Family,"Summit, NJ ",A unique out of the way experience,"Our family of 5 drove the hour from Jackson to the Hot Springs. This experience is for the hardy. It's an hour from Jackson--most of which is on a rugged dirt road. The views en route to the hot springs are gorgeous--forests, streams & mountains. When we finally arrived, it was raining, but it was fine--the water is warm and you didn't notice the rain. The views are outstanding--mountains and forests. The ""facilities"" are rustic (that's generous)--a dark, wooden changing room is about it. I have to say though, it was so peaceful and one of the most remote places I've ever visited. The pool was old, but it was fine. It was like a giant natural water hot tub. We all really enjoyed the experience."
249,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2014 , Family, ,view is awesome,We almost did not go to this spot because of the reviews but I am glad we did. The trip to the east from Hoback junction to pinedale was so pretty. You do go down on a dirt road but the canyon that it is in is so beautiful. There is a amazing waterfall that we had no idea was there. The hot springs is like a pool but my kids loved it.
250,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2014 , Family,"Tampa, FL ",Worth the scenic drive!,"We had a few hours to fill at the end of our day in Jackson, so we made the drive to Granite Hot Springs. The drive is a bit of a hike, but it wasn't bad if you take in the beautiful scenery along the way. The last 10 miles or so is on a bumpy gravel/dirt road…so be sure your transportation is appropriate. Just before you get to the Hot Springs, be sure to stop at the pull out and walk down to admire the beautiful Granite Falls. It was just breathtaking to see a gushing waterfall so closely (coming from Florida where we don't have waterfalls!). Then a very short drive & walk to the Hot Springs pool. It was nice and warm, as expected. It is rather rustic and small, but it was a nice way to spend an hour swimming and hanging out with the kids. The price was very reasonable. I didn't use the restrooms or changing facilities, so I can't comment on those."
251,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2014 , Family,"Scaly Mountain, NC ",Fun rustic inexpensive outing with beautiful drive but narrow dirt road,We took the trip to Granite Hot Springs during our trip outside of Jackson Hole Wy and it was an adventure! The actual hot springs pool was built in the 1930's so it is rustic. Changing rooms are by gender and no privacy stalls so be prepared to change your clothes with strangers. The cost is very nominal but they only accept cash so a couple of us had to trek back to the car for additional cash. Be aware that the hot springs are about 10 miles off the main road on a gravel road which at times you wonder how two cars can even pass but we managed. But the nature off the road is really beautiful. Saw a bald eagle and some kind of huge heron wading in the river below.  Kids loved the pool and it was soothing to us grandparents aches and pains!:) also can trek down to a waterfall just below the pool. Good economical family outing with beautiful vistas from the pool!! Enjoy!
252,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2014 , Family,"Edina, MN ","Extremly rustic warm pool at end of a long, dusty road","This is a rustic ""hot"" springs location adjacent to a camp ground back a long, dusty pot-holed road. Because of the location of the road, it is at least and hour from Jackson Hole and not worth the trip. If you are camping in that area, it would be a good break but otherwise, despite a beautiful landscape I would not drive down that road at 5-10 MPH."
253,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2014 , Family,"Craig, CO ",Maybe I've visited to too many awesome natural hot springs to be impressed.,"The 45 minute drive from Jackson was beautiful, but I was disappointed with the Granite Hot Springs. Where most hot springs, both natural and man ""improved"", have great places to sit and enjoy the water, this was not the case here. There was one side of the swimming pool with a slanted side that people tried to ""rest"" along, but with the really slick footing (slimy) it was a challenge to stand, much less sit. Even where the water flows in, which looks like a great sitting area, the slime, the smell, and the lukewarm water leaves a bit to be desired. I've visited hot springs, both hidden gems and public gathering spots, for years. This is one I won't revisit. Riding the chair lift up to the top of Snow King Mountain was a better way to spend an afternoon."
254,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2014 , Friends,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Nice and Warm,"These hot springs are a great asset when you are camping! We went up several times a day to soak. It really made your skin soft and made you feel refreshed! These pools do get busy in the middle of the day, so going right as they open or close is the best time to go!"
255,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2014 , Family,"Chesterfield, Missouri ",History and a surreal setting,"We heard about this special place after arriving in Jackson. This wonderful swimming pool built by the CCC during the depression is like nothing else you've seen. The bottom and sides are a strange marriage of concrete and native rock. Water enters the pool directly from a hot spring that issues from an opening in the rock a few feet away, at over 100 degrees, but cools down to a comfortable 93 in the pool. It is very rustic and low-key, with an attendant holed up in the old office/change rooms building on the uphill side, but the setting could not be more beautiful. You arrive at the pool after a scenic 11-mile drive throught the Hoback River Canyon, then another 11 miles on narrow roads up the equally-scenic Granite Creek Canyon. You know you are near when you reach a spectacular waterfall. Other hot springs in their natural state are accessible across the creek from this fall but high water prevented us from visiting. If you have an afternoon to kill and love mountain scenery and relaxing warm springs, take the plunge."
256,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2014 , Family, ,"It's a pool, but it is a hot spring fed pool.","We had a half a day in Jackson to squeeze in before a 1 hour trail ride (after shopping and going to the rodeo the day and night before). I wish we had spent much longer here. We were only able to spend 1 hour here after driving 45 minutes to get there. Please know that if you are looking for directions, there are 2 Granite Creek Roads: one is in the Grand Teton National Park, north of Jackson. That is not the one. You need to go to the Granite Creek Road, southeast of Jackson. The dirt road is about 10 miles to the pool, but it is worth it. Not too crowded even the week of the 4th of July. The price is right, too. $4 for kids and I think $8 for adults. Kids ages 8, 13, and 15 ( and 45 and 45) all wish we could have stayed. This is not a huge pool, not a resort pool. If you want a high end pool, this is not it. But, if you want a great, small pool, with beautiful rocks around, knowing it was constructed in 1933 by the CCC with average temps from the spring of 95 in summer and 114 in winter, this is the pool for you. We would go back and wish we did not have to leave when we did. Bring a cooler with lunch and beverages."
257,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2014 , Friends,"Madison, WI ","Beautiful, soothing, fun!","Went years ago (1990's) by snowmobile and had an amazing day. As seasoned riders, the 10 mile trip in was a piece of cake. Changing into swimsuits in the dead of January was chilly, but oh-so-worth-it. Spent a good long time in the pool, taking photos sitting in swimsuits in snowbanks, laughing and relaxing with 10 friends and family members. Was concerned about getting chilled on the trek to change back to snowmobile clothes and on our ride out, but the warmth of the water stayed with us and kept us super comfy. Would highly recommend taking this trip to anyone."
258,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2014 , Family,"Wabash, IN ",Great Natural Wonder,"Sure it's a long slow drive (11 miles) and the road isn't exactly in the best condition (dirt - sometimes muddy with potholes) but that's what makes this place great. These so called ""detractors"" add to the serenity by keeping those that aren't able to handle these ""natural conditions"" away. Thus the hot springs are less crowded and keep their simplistic appeal. You can't really get any better than this: a constructed tub built into the side of a mountain with a flowing river below, and a waterfall nearby. As you sit in the pool and look up you can see snow capped peaks and hear rushing water. This place is serene. There is a fee and minimal bathroom facilities (pit toilet)    A note on the road: our group drove two 15 passenger mini-buses down the road without problem. Others on here put to much into the ""danger"" and ""hazard"" of the road. While the road was muddy when we visited, an experienced driver will have no problem making the drive."
259,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2014 , Family,"Flower Mound, TX ",June snow,"Great drive and scenery, although the road was very muddy due to the rain and snow.

It was a little cold getting changed into bathing suits, note it is just a small room with benches and no privacy. Once you change into your swim suit you have to walk down a couple stairs and right into the water. Women bring a hair tie so you don't have a wet head when you get out. This is a must do on your trip."

271,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2013 , Family, ,Big heated pool,I wouldn't make the trip just for the springs. Basically it is a big heated pool. The surrounding area however is beautiful. Make a day of it and checkout some of the trails and adjacent falls.
272,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2013 , Solo,"Konstanz, Germany ",Worth the trouble to get to,"Granite Hot Springs is a classic western hot spring with exceptionally good water (very low sulfur) in a very natural environment with beautiful views. Getting there in the summer requires driving about 10 miles on a dusty, washboardy dirt road that turns a lot of people off. But that's why it's good; it's a relatively uncrowded attraction, and, hey, if you're in a rental car, what do you care, anyway? In the winter it can be accessed by snowmobile (rent by the day if you know how or go on a guided trip) or treat yourself to a dog sled trip for an unforgettable experience. The ""amenities"" are basic: a concrete pool with a deck, ""rustic"" changing rooms, a few picnic tables and national park style toilets. Note that the pool is completely drained and refilled each night, so it's clean, even if there happened to have been a childrens' birthday party the day before. The price is right, $6 per adult as of this writing. Bring a picnic, do a soak, enjoy your snack, do another soak, hit the road. 2-3 hours plus driving time makes this a leisurely day trip with time to do something else before dinner in town."
273,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2013 , Family,"Gaithersburg, MD ",so warm,"Travel here was part of the package offered by Spotted Horse Ranch. The day we went there it was pretty hot, but our group had the place to ourselves. The water was so warm and inviting. We stayed for about an hour and that was enough. My kids had a blast. I suspect the time to go is in the winter. We didn't use the locker room, so I can't say if it was clean. I also have no idea how much the entrance fee was, since it was included in our package."
274,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Oct 2013 , Couples,"Saint Charles, MO ",Wow!,You SO need to go here! There is about a 10 mile drive down a dirt road but it is worth the drive!

We went at 10:00 when it opened so it was not crowded. This was one of the best things we did on our trip!
275,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Oct 2013 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",This is the only review you'll ever need...,"This is the only review you'll ever need. So let me give you the low down. If you do only one relaxing thing in Jackson, go to Granite Hot Springs. Nearly every negative comment on here (although there were only a few) was patently wrong. This place was the highlight of a great trip we took in October 2013. Relaxing. Beautiful. Completely worth the drive.    Now let's debunk the myths. First off, the road to the springs. The dirt road leading you to this relaxing paradise is clearly marked on the 191. Don't believe that it's not or that this place is hard to find. There is a large, carved, wooden sign pointing you in the right direction. Simply hop in the 89 South from Jackson, and then about 12 miles later, take the 191 south for another 10 miles or so until you see the sign on the left-hand side.    Second myth. The road and the drive. Once on the road, you will realize that with the exception of a few 10 meter stretches, the road comfortably fits two vehicles, one going in either direction. Don't believe anything else anyone tells you. There are NO treacherous turns. Not a single one. And you do NOT need four-wheel drive to get up and down this road. Anyone telling you that is sipping some bizarre kool-aid. Yes, it is an eleven-mile dirt road. Yes, it is very bumpy. Yes, there are potholes. But I drove it today completely dry on the way to the springs and in the middle of a rainstorm on the way back. In. My. Four cylinder. Two-wheel drive. 1998. Honda. Civic. Yes, it was bumpy. But completely doable and completely worth it.    Third myth. The springs themselves. The pool is cement and was made by the civil corps of engineers in the 30's. But the spring itself feeding the pool is totally legit. You sit in the pool and on the upper end, the hot water comes into the pool from the mountain. Then it spills out the lower end and down the river. The pool merely collects the hot water so that people can relax in it. And yes, it is extremely relaxing. We stayed probably 2 1/2 hours with my two year old and had a blast. You're in the middle of the woods, next to a beautiful river, and when I went, on October 2nd, we were at times, the only people in the spring. I cannot vouch for the rest of the year. During our stay, it was misty, and drizzled a bit, making the surrounding forest absolutely beautiful (See attached photograph)    I would recommend calling ahead to see if it is open when you wish to go. The number is 1-307-734-7400. Normal season runs May 20 to Oct 31. See this site for more details: http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/btnf/recreation/wateractivities/recarea/?recid=71639&actid=82    Go. Take an afternoon or morning and do it. Don't listen to the haters. Is it a hot spring like those in Iceland with the pristine cyan water next to a resort made out of ice? No. Is it totally worth your time as a worthy activity in Jackson, Wyoming? Oh yeah. Can you buy lunch in Jackson for six bucks? Nope. But you can relax in a natural spring in the woods."
276,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Sep 2013 , Couples,"Evergreen, CO ",Worth the drive to get there...,"We've been going to Jackson Hole every summer for 27 years and Granite Hot Springs has been on my husbands bucket list that long. It is an effort to get to, but worth the drive. It's about 10 miles south out of town down the Hoback and another 10 miles down a 4WD dirt road in National Forest. It's is absolutely gorgeous all the way there. About a mile before the springs is a stunning waterfall. The spring itself is a concrete pool built by the CCC. As far as hot springs go it is pretty clean. The water is clean and pure, coming right out of the mountain. The day we were there it obviously had not been emptied and scrubbed the night before as it usually is, but it wasn't bad. The temperature is perfect...just like a jacuzzi. You will be hard-pressed to find a natural hot spring in such a beautiful setting. We plan to make a trip back in the winter and snowmobile in."

280,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2013,not available, ,Magical,This was one of the highlights of our trip out west. You truly feel like you are in the middle of the wilderness because you are. The trip there is an experience in itself. We had a fpur wheel drive but we saw cars that seemed to be doing just fine. The views while soaking in the spring are magnificent. It is almost a spiritual experience being so far off the beaten path soaking in the warmth of the natural spring. We highly recommend it! It was the experience of a lifetime. Very clean too!
281,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2013 , Family,"Freeland, MI ",Beautiful Views in the summer,"Caution; Best if you have a truck, very hard on a car, (unless it is a rental), really a 1 lane gravel road with many sharp curves, use caution. Hard to find with word directions, approximately 1 hour south of Jackson. Here is the GPS Coordinates. N.43º16.976' W110º32.048' These coordinates take you to the entrance of the 10 mile road off of the main paved road. A nice adventure trip down a gravel, bumpy road for 10 miles. The view of the Hoback River is awesome the entire way as the road is elevated. there are spots you can pull off, and enjoy the river. Many people trying for the big catch. Near the end of the 10 miles is a few private homes; a Club/resort; trail heads for hiking; a huge water fall; campground (rustic) and the Hot springs. Currently it costs $6.00 for all day to enter the HotSprings, there is a changing room. Out door John's provided. Take your lunch, and enjoy the 93º water in the summer or 104º in the winter when you can get a dog sled ride or the popular snowmobile ride. There is a pole barn advertising Dog Sled rides at the beginning of the 10 miles. The HotSprings is nothing special, but is a change of pace. The pool like area, is dumped nightly into the Hoback River then it fills up with fresh warm water nightly. While I was hiking; we saw some bear scat.. Be cautious. Hiking appropriate for families. There is lots of camping available near the Hotsprings in the forest campground. Stay up to 16 days."
282,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2013 , Friends,"Orem, UT ",Always a Hit,"Every time we come to Jackson we make a trip to the Hot Springs. Not so much for the hot springs, but mainly for all the different hiking trails, beautiful wildflowers and the opportunity to see wildlife. Great place."
283,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Aug 2013 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Fun for family and NOT CROWDED!,"This was a great side trip for our family. It does require a 10 mile or so jaunt down a dirt road, but the road is smooth and a regular car should have no trouble navigating the terrain. We did read some reviews that said you would need a 4 wheel drive to make it happen, but that is absolutely NOT TRUE! We were so glad we took the chance and went anyway. The pool was warm, clean and very pleasant. When we arrived there were only maybe 5 other people there. There were never more than 10 or so. It was relaxing and nice to get away from the crowds in Jackson that are everywhere else for a while. I highly recommend it. I wish I had brought one of those cheap ring floats to use while there. That would have made it even more relaxing. Our family has teenagers but there were also families there with younger kids. There is no lifeguard, so it would be good for any age as long as they can swim well."
284,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2013,not available,"Ogden, UT ",Lovely mountain escape and unique experience!,"10 miles up a dirt road on a very scenic and beautiful valley is nothing to complain about, especially once you reach your destination!    We heard it was going to rain on that day of our vacation, so we thought a soak in a warm springs sounded just right! How incredible it was to sit high in the mountains with rain falling and soaking in a muscle relaxing warm pool.    My mother in law was unhappy with the moss on the bottom of the pool and the forest debris floating around. I hardly noticed and I'm not quite sure what she was expecting in the heart of the forest of a natural hot spring. It's not a 5 star hotel swimming pool. It's a natural spring with natural aspects. But if your expectation is forest free, this may not be the place for you.    If you're not afraid of a little nature, one of the most beautiful scenic atmospheres, and a delicious temperature for soaking after a hike, then don't miss this spot!!! We will hit it again for sure!"
285,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2013,not available,"Houston, TX ",Enjoyable and a good value.,Don't use apple maps/Siri to find because she takes you to the total wrong place. Use the written directions. It is down about 12 miles off the main highway and 10 miles down a gravel road but to us worth it. Not many people at all. Was warm (93 degrees) and they have a place to change. Nothing fancy so bring water and food.
286,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2013 , Family,"Monroe, Louisiana, United States ",Family vacation,Nice drive down a gravel road. The hot springs pool was nice. Enjoyed a nice relaxing day with the family.
287,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2013 , Friends,"Red Rock, Arizona ",Beautiful Drive,"Wow, what a pleasant drive to come upon a magnificent water fall. Then just above are the pools where you can experience a swim fresh fed from the hot springs. It was a wonderful experience."
288,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2013 , Friends,"Moodus, CT ",Relax!,This hot spring is like a huge hot pool! It is way off the beaten bath but well worth the drive. It takes about 45 minutes fromJackson to get to the hot spring on a very long dirt road! Its cheap at $6 a person for the whole day! As well as the veiw is super.
289,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Feb 2013 , Family,chapel hill ,The wintertime snowmobile trip is fantastic!,"I took a wintertime snowmobile trip to Granite Hot springs several years ago and it was fantastic. The guide took us to a meadow where we could really let loose and enjoy snowmobiling the powder, then onward a few miles through spectacular scenery to the hot springs in a gorgeous setting. The springs themselves tumble over rocks making one part of the pool hotter than the rest. Then the company cooked up a steak, potato and salad dinner...just right to energize us for the ride back in the afternoon with the afternoon sun making the mountains really gorgeous. I made a slide show of the trip at http://jacksonholejournal.net/sleds. Click on the small arrow to see for yourself what fun it is."
290,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2013 , Family,"Brookfield, VT ",Beautiful ride - disappointing hot spring.,"The ride from the main road is a bit lengthy on a dusty dirt road however it is very beautiful. The pool however is very disappointing. It is $6 to get into the warm water. There is one corner that 3 adults can fit into where the water actually streams into where it is very hot. If you have a few travelers who plant themselves in that spot, you will have difficulties in getting in close enough for you or your family members to really experience hot water steaming out of the mountains into the pool. The pool is very slimy where the hot water runs through and there is lots of stuff floating in the man made pool. They allow floats in the pool, this made the pool crowded and took away from the screen natural setting."
291,Granite_Hot_Springs2,May 2013 , Friends,"Sarasota, FL ",granite falls is a treasure,"Granite falls is unbelievable. Snow covered mountains and you sitting in a very comfortable water. I live in florida near warm mineral springs, north port, fl, not even comparable to the beauty of wyoming. Mountains, water, good friends, the road is beautiful, the river from granite falls is spectacular and we saw elk, moose, bear, big horn sheep, everything you would want to see on the dirt road to the pool. I agree, there are not many places like this left, it has a few necessities, changing house and someone full time on site to pay, answer questions and take care of area. Nice time for all. Highly reccomend."
292,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jul 2013 , Solo,"Parrish, FL ",Looooooooong drive,"Is it worth it or not??? Here is my verdict... First of all, it's a long dirt drive (I mean seriously loooooong). The view along the way is amazing. The swimming pool is very small. No shower area. It needs a lot of patience if you plan to go here..... 3/5 for me."
293,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2013 , Family,"Branson, Missouri ","The Thing Thant "" Makes It "" Is The Setting!","There are not many places like this left. I went there as a kid, and my kids went with us and now we take the grandchildren! The hot water runs out of the mountain and the setting is beautiful. You do have to drive ten miles up the dirt road(yes), but there will be others there!"
294,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2013 , Family,"Venice, FL ",OK if you're not accustomed to water activities elsewhere.,"Look closely at the pictures. It is a natural spring coming out of the mountain which would be really cool if it wasn't damned up into a really tacky man-made swimming pool, although not sure how else they could have done it. It is small. It seemed a bit creepy with middle aged men lounging at the opposite end of the pool anticipating the disrobing of swimmers, yuck. We didn't go in. Instead chose to play in Granite Falls a few hundred yards away which was gorgeous, fun and no fee. Your GPS will not get you there. Call the phone number for a long recorded message with precise directions. It's about an hour driving time from Jackson. Scenic."
295,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jun 2013 , Family,"Oklahoma City, OK ","Not easy to find, but worth it",This is not a difficult drive on the gravel/dirt road in the summer. It does have lots of twists and turns. The pool is about 92 degrees in the summer (warmer in the winter). There are no concessions or anything so you'll want to bring your own snacks and drinks (no alcohol is allowed). It's odd to have to get out of the pool to cool off. There are changing rooms but the bathrooms are down the hill from the pool. This was a great little adventure! I think admission was $6 for adults and $4 for kids (don't remember the ages).
296,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Mar 2013 , Couples,"Show Low, AZ ",Beautiful and relaxing,"We snowmobiled into the the hot springs and had a wonderful time. It was a beautiful trip in and we enjoyed some time at the nearby waterfall. The hot spring was clean and very relaxing, and the views of the snow covered mountains was spectacular."
297,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Mar 2013 , Couples,"Asheboro, NC ",Granite Hot Springs/Dogsledding Adventure,"We arrived at the Hot Spring by way of Dogsled. It was a wonderful trip!!! My feet were cold so the hot springs felt ""really"" hot when I first went in but it soon felt great. It snowed the entire time making it so much more fun. I wish there had of been more privacy in the dressing area. There were several folks in the room and I had to stand next to the door. Every time someone came in or out you had to be careful that no one on the outside saw you getting undressed. Overall, it was one of our favorite activities of the vacation."
298,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Mar 2013 , Friends,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Great experience with snow coming down,"The hot springs was great. I remembered to pack my bathing suit and towel, but forgot a pair of sandales or some other footwear to walk from the changing room to the hot springs pool. There was so much wet snow coming down when I went, and my feet felt really cold walking to/from the changing room to the hot springs, but my body was so warm from the hot soak, I didn't really mind afterwards. It was great!!!"
299,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Mar 2013 , Friends,"Atlanta, GA ",112 Degrees (F),"For snow fanatics, try Granite Hot Springs. If it's your first snowmobile trip, try a guided tour first for the basics. If you have experience on a snowmobile, are good with driving a truck, and trailering a boat, then you'll do fine with hauling snowmobiles out to the springs. Jackson Hole Adventure Rentals (JHAR) in Jackson, WY provides a great setup. Allow about 30-40 minutes from JHAR to arrive at the launch to Granite Hot Springs. From JHAR, head south about 11 miles on Hwy 189 to Hoback Junction (3-way roundabout) and then head east again about 11 miles to Granite. Turn into the single lane drive, park, and launch your snowmobiles. Follow the trail approximately 6 miles north to the springs. Be sure to enjoy the falls just before you reach the springs.    For a dip in the springs, wear your swimming suit under your clothes; take a bath robe, towel, and some cash in small bills to pay the fee to enter the springs. The springs are generally 112 degrees (F) in the winter (93 in summer). For information about this national park amenity, check the U.S. Forestry Service - Granite Hot Springs website or call at 1-307-734-7400 to verify the springs are open and the fee amount.    While on the trail, watch for cross-country skiers, dog sleds, and other snowmobilers. Remember not all snowmobiles are suitable for off-trail fun. If you have only a trail worthy ride, you may ride off trail near the launch site (parking lot) at the head of the trail and again near Granite Falls. Digging out a snowmobile is no fun and extremely difficult. Get help if you get stuck – be safe – have a great time."
300,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Mar 2013 , Couples,"West Palm Beach, FL ",good soak,"After snowmobiling in the morning it was a great place to soak. You can also ski to this area. The birds are around, and the snow piles up under the picnic tables making it difficult to sit to eat."
301,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Feb 2013 , Family,"Windham, NH ",Great Spot to Visit,"We visited Granite Hot Springs via snowmobile which was really fun. It is about 20 miles roundtrip. It is an amazing hot spring which feels great after the ride. It provides a changing room and a friendly overseer named ""Willis"" and his more than friendly dog ""Claire"". Many folks travel out via dog sled as well which is another option. Worth the visit."
302,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Feb 2013,not available,"Salt Lake City, Utah, USA ",Delightful after snowmobiling,"We took a guided snowmobile tour to this site. We made sure we followed the advice of other TripAdvisor users and brought bath robes and water shoes to wear to and from the changing rooms. We also wore our swimming suits under our clothes on our way up so we had quick changing time. The spring was lovely and clean, and the caretaker was very interesting. Take a plastic bag to carry your wet suit back in. Be careful going down the slick stairs from the changing room - my boyfriend fell. The hot spring and the sights were simply beautiful."
303,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Dec 2012 , Family,"Austin, TX ",Secret spot,"Snowmobile or hike(summer) up to these hot springs. Secluded and natural. The little wooden dressing rooms are just enough to change, scoot down to the rocky edge of the pool, enjoy the view and the warmth. Must see, won't forget this special treat."
304,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2013 , Family,"Grand Haven, MI ",Fantastic winter stop,We visited this as part of the Iditarod Dogsledding and had a great time in the Hot Springs. Very nice and warm water set amongst the snowy mountain. You can only get their via snowmobile or dogsled so make sure to plan a trip. An absolute fantastic part of the trip.
305,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2013 , Couples,"Annville, PA ",WOW,"This was a lot of fun - after dog sledding for a couple hours, this was a great break before a picnic lunch in the snow under the trees. Even the cold trip from/to the changing rooms wasn't as bad as expected. Beautiful scenery!"
306,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2013 , Friends,"Casper, WY ",Warmth in the Cold,This was an amazing snowmobile ride in to the thermal pools. It was very relaxing after such cold temperatures in the morning. Bathrooms are a slight walk away from the changing room which is pretty cold and crowded but worth the experience. I would love to take our boys there during the cold winter.
307,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Jan 2013 , Couples,"Reva, VA ",Once in a lifetime!!!,This was great. A little cold in Jan but at least we can say we did it...I don't think I would do it again...
308,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Dec 2012,not available,"Jackson, Wyoming, United States ",Winter wonderland,"Winter is the best time to go in my opinion. You ride a snowmobile in on a groomed trail and then at the end you get to soak in the natural hot spring. There are many options on getting out there in the winter. You can go on a guided tour, rent your own snowmobiles, or if your lucky enough to own one thats the best way! Guided tours offer lunch, the guid will cook your lunch as you gt to play in the hot pools. If your lookng for a good company to take a giuded tour with I highly reccomend Jackson Hole Snowmobile Tours. Friendly service, reasonable pricing and great fun people!"
309,Granite_Hot_Springs2,Dec 2012 , Family,"Barnstaple, UK ",Wonderful springs!,"We visited the springs with the Scenic Safari snowmobile tour company, which involved a 20 mile round trip by snowmobile to the springs. The springs themselves are excellent - a large pool has been created which provides plenty of room. The water is surprisingly hot at the point at which it enters the pool. The views from the pool are stunning - towering mountains covered with snow. The only drawback was the changing area which is far too small for the number of people that visit. We got there reasonably early; by the time we had finished in the pool we found our clothes buried under several other people's. A good tip in winter is to bring flip-flops; you have to emerge from the changing room and go down some snowy wooden steps to get to the pool!"
