0,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2021,not available,"Argyle, TX, ",Nice Lake - Enjoy It in Summer,"The scenery was beautiful, but the lake level was way down when we visited in September. I'm hoping for a good snow melt to replenish the water and hope to return in the summer months to enjoy it."
1,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2021,not available,"Fishers, IN ","Amazing view and crisp, crystal clear water","We spent a couple hours at the lake taking a swim on our first day at the Grand Tetons. The water was crystal clear but very chilly. A great idea on a very warm day but we could only last about 15 minutes before we had to get out and warm up before going back in again. The ""beach"" we went to was next to a boat launch and was all river rock (smooth stones). The lake bottom was the same. We took our water shoes, which I would highly recommend."
2,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"Charlotte, NC, ",Pretty Rocks,"The beach area here is a pretty good one. While I'd prefer String Lake for a lake day of swimming, we did ok here. The rocks around the beach are all brightly colored and beautiful (albeit a lot of algae build on them). Our kids had a lot of fun catching and releasing tadpoles and froglets (Mid-July), that gathered near the shore. The views of the mountains from the lakeshore are pretty incredible and unimpeded, so it makes for some great photography too."
3,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Unbelievable,"Huge lake in Grand Teton National Park with plenty of spots to pull off the road or stop at picnic areas, lodges, etc. No matter where you stop along this lake, you are guaranteed some of the most incredible and breath-taking views of your entire life. The pictures I have attached to this review are taken from the Jackson Lake Visitor Center and Jackson Lake Lodge."
4,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2021 , Family,"Denison, TX ",Beautiful water!,We stopped at the Jackson lake dam & it was a pretty neat place to check out. We walked a few small trails around the dam area & they were all very easy. We also walked over the dam while the flood gates were open & it was pretty cool!!
5,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2020,not available,"Chesapeake Beach, MD, ",The Best View is Being ON the Water,Jackson Lake is clear and provided a stunning mirror for the Tetons. We could not resist the desire to be on the water so we went to the Colter Bay Village Marina and got in line about 1 1/2 hours before the rental shop opened so we could go kayaking. Note that once you are out on the lake the wind can really pick up and make for quite an adventure.
6,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2021,not available,"Virginia Beach, VA, ",Magnificent lake to Behold !!!,"Awesome and generous Lake with pristine mountains w snow caps and green vegetation all over. While you are there, check out the Jackson Dam as well. Its a stunner for sure."

10,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2020,not available,"Lakeside, CA ",Great spot for a picnic lunch,"We visited Grand Teton in September expecting it to be less crowded; boy were we in for a surprise! Much of the park was crawling with tourists in lines of cars that was comparable to my experience in Yosemite on the 4th of July! Anyway, Jackson Lake was a nice peaceful respite from the crowds. It seems few people stop there so we had a picnic area all to ourselves! Very nice."
11,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Plant City, FL, ",Beautiful blue water with great mountain views,"We liked seeing the dam, the boats on the lake, and the views of the mountain range and glaciers. Serene place, and nice to just sit, relax and enjoy the views"

19,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2020,not available,"Palo Alto, CA ","Beautiful to look at from the shore, more beautiful in the water","Jackson Lake is so beautiful and much less crowded than Jenny Lake. We visited Jackson Lake on July 8th when we learned that kayaks and canoes were not available at Jenny Lake. We rented 1 double kayak and 1 canoe for an hour for $55 and went out onto the lake. It was a beautiful sunny day, though the wind picked up after 20 minutes and we had to paddle quite a bit into the headwind. However, the view of the Grand Tetons from the lake cannot be matched. My husband and son were in the canoe and took the opportunity to do some fishing. My daughter and I were in the kayak and thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and serenity of the Lake."

28,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2019,not available,"Gatesville, TX, ",Large lake surrounded by fantastic scenery,"During our 3 day Grand Teton National Park visit there were many times we explored around Lake jackson. This lake is quite large so it encroaches into Grand Teton from several directions. Saw Jackson Lake from Jackson Lake Dam, Coulter Bay, Signal Mountain Lodge (especially during lunch at the Trapper Grill), Chapel of the Sacred Heart area, and the northern end of the 42 mile park road. Regardless of where you are near the lake the views are spectacular."

36,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Fernandina Beach, FL ",TRAILS AROUND WITH MANY PHOTO OPS,Great for morning walks with mountains as a backdrop and the rolling meadows. You most likely will find some elk roaming around We saw a mother and 3 small ones. You need to be patient as they dart out from trees into a clearing and maybe hear a noise that scares them back.
37,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Harrisville, NH ",Interesting place,Stopped at the dam. Took a short walk on both sides of the road. Interesting views of the working of the dam. Spectacular Views of the Tetons.
38,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Beutiful Lake,We were in Yellowstone earlier in the week but I think this ranked in the top 3 things we did on our 8 day vacation. We rented a boat from Colter Bay. The views from the boat were amazing. It was very quiet time of day and it felt like we were the only people out there with the spectacular mountains rising from the water. I would defiantly do it again!
39,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Largest Lake and Mt. Moran,This largest lake of the Tetons provides great views and photos. Photos are best earlier in the day as the sun is behind and not nearly as good late in the day. Animals are also likely early in the day. We saw a massive bull elk right next to the road.

47,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2019,not available,"Atlanta, GA, ",Incredibly stunning!,"Such incredible beauty & splendor!

49,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Klamath Falls, OR ",Beautiful but crowded,"This whole Teton area is gorgeous, but the town of Jackson itself is just too ""citified"" and crowded - not for those seeking solitude, but good for those liking a more varied social setting with lots of amenities."

56,Jackson_Lake,May 2019 , Friends,"Crowley, TX, ",The Views & Sights Are Endless,Simply an amazing lake that is large vertically and has stunning views of the Tetons.

57,Jackson_Lake,May 2019 , Couples,"London, UK ",Stunningly beautiful,"Even half covered in ice, Jackson Lake is stunningly beautiful. Strongly recommend. But consider taking bear spray for peace of mind."
58,Jackson_Lake,May 2019 , Couples,"Mesa, AZ, ",Vacation,This was a pretty cool lake lots to see beautiful blue still a lot of ice on everything it is early in the season we were happy to visit these destinations without a lot of people around
59,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"United States, ",beautiful with the Teton range backdrop,"I think Jaskson lake is more or less similar to other lakes, but it has the Teton range as it's backdrop, so making it much much more beautiful than the usual lake, so I think the credit should be given to the Teton mountain range instead of to the lake. So I gave 3 stars to the lake, but if for the Teton mountain range, it wroth 4 stars. (if more snow /ice on it, may worth even 5 stars)  It seems that there is boat tour you can join to experience the lake and the environment more."
60,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Jaipur, India ",Nice scenic view of this grand lake,"we only stopped here for half an hour to enjoy the view and click pictures. With the background of high mountains and large blue lake, this makes for one of the best places to click pictures."
61,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Florence, KY ",Great Lake View,Our tour guide brought us here for a picnic lunch. We ate at one of the tables along the beach and looked out over the lake at the mountains. It was a great view. The water is blue unlike what we see back east. One person was swimming in it briefly but it is very cold. I would not advise for most.
62,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Ferndale, WA ",RVing Humm?,RVing in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is challenging. Specifically purchasing a shorter 24' RV to travel easier around Parks the length is not the only problem. The first come first serve campgrounds are absolutely crazy. All campers continually drive around and around until they can dart into a spot being vacated. Being there off season this must be a zoo during the summer. If there is a solution Parks should publish a guide specifically for RV camping options. In the mean time it will be awhile before I want to go back.
63,Jackson_Lake,Oct 2018 , Friends,"Hawkins, TX ",Worth the walk,My friend and I took the hike around Jenny Lake and the views of the mountains reflecting in the water were awesome! Easy hike along the shore and well worth it. Another Teton Treasure!

67,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",Donâ€™t miss this!!,"Sure itâ€™s difficult to chose from all the possible places the Yellowstone and Teton environs offer - you will be so glad you spent some time at Jackson Lake. Several lodges offer top-shelf services as well as simple access to unforgettable scenic trails with views that just inspire. Friendly staff provide everything from tasty world class cuisine and espresso to clean bathrooms with EVERYThing in between. You can be pampered or rough it - but only minutes from remote trails with stunning views, or kayaks, or equine companionship.    Very walkable trails along waters edge or long treks - opportunities for every age and preference...but so MUCH beauty!"
68,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"St Helens, UK ",I only give this lake an average score as there are other smaller lakes in the area that offer more,The best way to appreciate this large lake is to do walks on it's shores or go for a sail on it if you are that way inclined. I did not do a sail but did the short 2 mile Lake shore trail in a figure 8 loop after doing the first part with a Ranger who did a talk about bears & being bear aware & how to use a bear spray which was very interesting.
69,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,Fort Atkinson ,"Classic Teton views, maybe third after Jenny and Colter.","If you have the time see all of the main views in GT, from Colter Bay, from Jackson and from Jenny. The postcard views are more likely from Jenny, and maybe Colter, but that comparison should not denigrate Jackson. All are beautiful, but hopefully this will help you set priorities if you time is limited."
70,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Orlando, FL ","MOST spectacular view, ever!","Spent a day fishing on Jackson Lake early July. Rented a boat out of the Cutler Bay Marina. The Tetons are known for their picturesque vistas but none of them compare with the views from Jackson Lake. Even though we only went a few miles up the lake, the view kept changing and we were amazed with dropped jaws the entire time.  Didn't catch anything but it was not a wasted afternoon by a long shot."
71,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Hawthorne, CA ",Beautiful location.,we had a wonderful experience at this lake. We camped 3 nights here and rented a small boat to cruise around the lake with. There are beaches around it that are perfect for families to enjoy. we brought our Golden Retriever and Maltipoo and they wouldn't get out of the water when the kids were playing!
72,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Henderson, NV, ",WOW!!,"Been here six times and it never gets old. Jackson Lake is one of those lakes when you drive by you want to rubber neck, looks like glass with the Teton Mtns in the distance. It takes your breath away. There are turnouts to get that awesome picture. Boat rentals, swimming, hiking, biking or just enjoy the view!!"

He took our two grown sons and grandson on a half day trip. He's a fishing pro and knows Jackson Lake like his front yard. They all came back with big grins and bags of 8 large lake trout, which Damian had cleaned. The Peaks Restaurant at Signal Mountain, just uphill from the marina, cooked them expertly for dinner that evening for our family of 12. What a great experience all the way around!"
92,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2018,not available,"Los Angeles, CA ",Majestic Mountains,"Jackson Lake is in Tetons National Park. On a Ranger Talk that we went to at Jenny Lake, I learned about the geology that formed Jenny Lake. We hiked up to Inspiration Point (aptly named) with a group, passing the water that was roaring down from the snowy peaks. We stayed in the Park in a cabin at the Jackson Lake Lodge, eating dinner there twice (once in the Mural Room and another evening at the bar- outside) both with unobstructed views of the lake and Gand Tetons. The food was good. On the way back from Jenny Lake we stopped for lunch at Signal Lake. It was so good, we returned the next day for both lunch and dinner. It's not as glitzy as Jackson Lake Lodge, but had great food, reasonably priced, and great service."

Our friends and us spend the day at the rocky beach here soaking up some sun and pristine waters. Some of us enjoyed canoeing to the different islands, while others just enjoyed the beautiful views of the Tetons while taking a dip in the cool lake itself. There is nothing that I can complain about here. There was plenty of parking, the lake area has activities and rentals to help you enjoy this place, as well as boat cruises. If you don't get a chance to get in the lake, you can always have a picnic or just pull-off at one of the overlooks and see for yourself how beautiful and serene this place is."

115,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2017,not available,"Manosque, France ",Disappointing if you don't spend enough time and entrance fee from parks,"Grand Teton, just south of Yellowstone, is a great place to watch wildlife. At least this is what the books are telling you. We spend approx. the whole day in the park but did not see any wildlife. The more weather conditions were very poor and the views were impeded. We spend time near Colter bay, Leigh lake, Jenny lake and along the snake river. My advise would be take your time and wait wildlife to show up. About entrance fees it possible to purchase tickets for Yellowstone and Grand Teton combined. If you plan to visit a whole bunch of parks purchase the annual pass for 80 $ US. It is valid in all NP and it is valid 1 year. Regarding this pass my conclusion is that the NPS website is giving very misleading information. I don't know why they call it an annual pass, but when I was preparing my road trip at no moment I could have imagined that a year pass is valid for ALL parks during 1 year. This what the site is saying quote"
116,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2017 , Family,"Placida, FL ",Great view of the mountains,The view from the Visitor's Center and the nearby overlook were wonderful.

The covered boat was quite comfortable with a pilot and a narrator. There were approximately 35 people on board. Essentially this was about a 90 minute ride around a beautiful lake with the two guides talking about the history of the area and the flora and fauna of the surrounding area. This was a pleasant and educational experience.  Recommended.

143,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Jackson, WY ",Great kayak lake!,"If your looking for great kayaking in Grand Teton Natl Park, this is your pick! You may depart at the normal boat launch then follow the. land on your left. Pass up the first turn but take either the second or third opening. BEWARE of getting in the open water as winds can come up quickly and flip you into the very cold water and you might develop hyperthermia quickly. Paddle quietly and you will suddenly be in the presence of eagles, geese, beavers and some beautiful deer or elk, or maybe some bear.  Have a great time!"

I wish I would have known how beautiful the Tetons really are - I would have skipped about half of the grand loop of Yellowstone and come here sooner. As it is, my husband and I stopped here on our way out of the park and rented a canoe from the Colter Bay Marina. Be patient if you rent the canoe - when we got there they were all rented and there's no waiting list, you have to stay there at the desk to wait for the next available - kind of a inefficient system but"

If I lived near Jackson Lake, I would be out here every week."

Fished 1PM - 4PM one Friday afternoon with our guide Ron. Purchased WY fish license in the Colter Bay marina shop 30 mins before our excursion. They provide everything else you need from gear & tackle standpoint. Ron also had cooler w/ ice on-board for drinks (tip: I should've brought a few beers from nearby mini-grocery; maria shop on the water doesn't sell any).    The boat is set up for fishing deep water lakes with attached, heavy duty sinkers to reach +80 ft depths. We also put lines out at 20-30 ft dept & along surface. Trolled his fav spots using cockpit fish finder. Despite fishing at less than ideal time of day we ended up catching a dozen lake trout.    Ron was great, very laid-back, told fun stories, my dad & I really enjoyed visiting with him. We lucked into beautiful day so views of lake were really spectacular. Even if we hadn't caught fish we would've enjoyed the boat ride with Ron.    This type of Guided lake experience is ideal for those who enjoy to fish but even more so just enjoy being outdoors. There are only two fishing guides available through Jackson Lake Lodge so book early."

Canoes and kayaks are available at Colter Bay marina for rent. There are also motor boats but I prefer non-motorized methods. The area you can paddle is covers a nice section of the lake. We saw osprey fishing. After getting back to the dock we heard bears were swimming not too far from where we were. Luckily we didn't come across them. It's a nice way to experience nature and a slightly different perspective on the mountains. Rentals are a minimum of 2 hours.

We stayed two nights at Jackson Lake Lodge. It makes a great base for visiting Yellowstone by doing the west-side one day and the east-side the second. Additionally, it is a stunning place to stay with a great restaurant. When we stay here, we always get rooms in the Lodge with the Lakeside views.

Our trip was during fire season and you could see fires on the hillsides. Be sure to check with the rangers before you go as they close parts of the road from Colter Bay to Flagg Ranch at times due to flare-ups. At least they did when we visited.    These are to-die-for views, no visit to the park is really complete without getting a good view of this spectacular place.    This is bear country so always be prepared. Bear spray is suggested.

The teens and children were fascinated in playing with them. Adults, not so much."
188,Jackson_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,"Gahanna, OH, ",Nice lake,Seemed like a nice lake but kind of boring maybe it's because we were there in October and everything was closed up but it was completely dead only one other care on the whole area that we could see and they were just looking for a bathroom.
189,Jackson_Lake,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Oakdale, CA ",Impressive Lake,If you take the 42-mile Scenic Loop you will pass Jackson Lake. It was beautiful!! We only stopped to take in the scenery but it was worth it. :)
190,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,New Jersey ,Wow!,"A beautiful lake at the base of the Grand Tetons that offers boating, swimming (brrr), fishing and just chilling out."
191,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Richmond, VA, ",A Really Big Lake!,"If you look at a map of Grand Teton National Park, you'll see how dominant the lake is to the Park. It is 15 miles long, and 7 miles, at its widest. Three of the Park's lodging options are on the lake. And, with the Teton Mountain Range in the background, .....beautiful views."
192,Jackson_Lake,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Leland, NC ",Scenic,The mountains were beautiful as they reflected on the lake. I can only imagine how they would look if the lake had been smooth!
193,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,SF ,So grand and peaceful,Peaceful and serene. Reflection of Tetons off the lake is postcard perfect. Great place to admire nature. Not to miss!
194,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Lafayette, IN, ",Glacial Lake with Mountain Reflections,Does it get much better than this? The lake becomes the mirror for the mountains. This is a rich view of the Teton's. I would suggest taking 30 minutes or so and visit the Lodge at Jackson Lake. There is a lovely bar looking out over the lake with indoor and outdoor seating. We loved doing this.
195,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"United States, ",Beautiful Lake,The lake is very beautiful. But we did not see many birds. Maybe that day there was fire next to the lake.
196,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,Wilmington ,"Wow, This is Some Lake!",This lake is huge! And if you drive around the area you'll be seeing a lot of it because it seems to be everywhere. It is beautiful surrounded by beautiful scenery. The roads are quite good and easy to traverse with lots of places to pull off.
197,Jackson_Lake,Nov 2015 , Couples,"Buenos Aires, Argentina ",Cool Lake,"Very nice view, great experience, everything went well there. Love the place will come back again!!!"
198,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Burbank, WA ",Wonderful Fishing and beauty all around,My family has been coming to Jackson Lake to fish and camp in Gros Ventre campground for 30 plus years. We've never had a bad trip. The fishing ranges from good to great. And it's hard to beat fishing at the base of Mount Moran and taking in the scenery while trolling for Lake Trout. Simply the best!
199,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Draper, UT ",Amazing View,"What a beautiful lake, and a amazing view of the Tetons. Crystal clear, Brilliant blue in color. Love this lake"
200,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2016 , Friends,"San Jose, CA ",Very pretty,"If visiting the Grand Tetons, this is a ""must see"". Very pretty. Try to go off season if possible. Even in September, lookouts were crowded."
201,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2016,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",Beautiful,This is a really beautiful lake. And it's right along the highway. It's a great place to stop for some great pictures. There are a lot of water birds if you have a scope to see them.

203,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Canton, OH ",National Park #2,"What a drive south from Yellowstone into Grand Teton, beautiful and more than enough scenic stops along the way for pictures. The Tetons off to the right are so majestic and awe inspiring as they just go on and on....America the beautiful!"
204,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Mims, FL, ",another fine combination of mountain peaks and water.,This is larger than Jenny Lake which everyone visits but also has magnificent snow capped mountains in August.
205,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Taylorsville, NC ",Beautiful views.,This is a wonderful spot to take a picture of the park. It is a gorgeous lake with the Tetons as a backdrop.
206,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Chicago, IL, ",Perfectly framed by the Teton mountain range!,On several lookouts right off the scenic loop as well as viewing decks of the lodges the lake is massive and fits right in with the Tetons.
207,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016,not available,"Jonesborough, TN ",Most Beautiful Lake!,"This may be the most beautiful lake I've ever seen or been on. (It competes with my local Watauga Lake which is in the mountains of TN.) The Teton mountains surrounding it are gorgeous. We hiked all around this lake and the views never grew old. Because of the beauty of this lake and other spots throughout GTNP, we ended up spending lots more time in this national park instead of Yellowstone (and I thought it would be the other way around!). If you get a chance, then take a scenic cruise or rent a boat at Colter Bay Marina so you can enjoy its beauty up close."
208,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Sun Prairie, WI ",Gorgeous Lake to View,"Cold mountain lake created by a dam. This large lake can be dangerous for small craft, canoes and the like as we saw numerous storms move in created large choppy waves on the lake that had been calm 5 minutes earlier. Not sure that I would rent a tin row boat with 10 hp motor even if you keep it close to shore it is not a boat to be on this body of water with. There are swim beaches and plenty of places to put a canoe or SUP in at Colter Bay Village. Fishing for Lake Trout seems to be the only success I have seen and heard of on this lake."
209,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,tennessee ,Such a Nice Lake in Front of Some Awsome Mountains!,Jackson Lake is at the foot of the Teton Mountains. It is so lovely-the lake and the mountains together. There are several places to pull over and take in the awesome view! Jackson Lodge is by the lake. I understand there are elk and moose in the area. We saw elk.
210,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Antioch, CA ",This is a fairly large lake behind a dam,The lake provides good views of the Teton mountains behind it. The water is released into the Snake River in a measured way for the use of Idaho farmers downstream. There is boating.
211,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Hastings, UK, ",Beautiful,"We drove up from Jenny lake  We were quite late getting to the lake, and the sun was going down we got some lovely photographs. It was really peaceful, however we felt that probably during the daytime it would be very busy and you may find it difficult to find a parking space  The loop is one way from the North. Worth the short diversion"
212,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Berkeley, CA ",A swimming lake at the feet of the Grand Teton.,"You could not buy a better place to sit or swim with the grandeur of the Grand Teton sitting virtually at the lake's edge. The air is clean, the water is clear, the stars pop at night and the mountains are as powerful as when the Sioux camped here."
213,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Phoenix, AZ ",Crystal Clear Lake,"The water is beautiful, so clear!! It also was not too cold to get in, my boys had a great time swimming in the lake."
214,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Cold Spring, MN ",This is a Beautiful Lake,This beautiful lake has many areas that you can't stop and enjoy the view. It's great to have the mountains as a backdrop. We really enjoyed the leeks marina area.
215,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016 , Friends,"JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping, Sweden ",Truly awesome,"This beautiful lake was truly awesome. Just hiking at it's shore, boating on it or just sitting at one of the many locations surrounding it looking at it. Take your pick. I loved all of it!"
216,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Las Vegas, NV ",Side trip,"We drove up to this point into Grand Teton National Park and it was stunning to say the least, but I wish we had alloted for more time as this park was more impressive to me than Yellowstone National Park. Maybe it was the glaciers in the backdrop of this gorgeous lake that reminded us of our trip last year to Glacier National Park which still remains our favorite park to this point.    If you don't have much time to explore, at least drive into the park and reach the Jackson Lake overlook and you will not be disappointed. We will definitely return to this park to see the entire scenic loop.    Highly recommended."
217,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples, ,Favorite of my trip!,This is a must see for anyone who is going to visit the Grand Tetons! The view is breathtaking and a memory one will never forget!
218,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",Beautiful lake,Rented a boat from signal mountain lodge for the whole family to see the lake and get views of the mountains. Really impressive lake and water is really clear
219,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Brunswick, GA ",Unbelievable experience.,"Drove through Yellowstone Park from the North entrance near Gardiner, MT to the South entrance into Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. We were sure we had seen the most beautiful scenery available during our trip through Yellowstone but, boy, we were wrong. The Grand Tetons across Jackson Lake knocked our socks off. I had seen pictures before but they do not do justice to it. I seems we saw a better view every quarter mile. We had to finally decide we had to stop taking pictures because it would have taken us hours to sort them out. I highly recommend that you use a panoramic exposure if you have that option. It is the closest you will come to getting it all in. If this is not on your Bucket List you are cheating yourself of a magnificent event. The Swiss Alps have nothing on it."
220,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Leawood, KS ",Best view ever,"Dawn or sunset, the view of the mountains from the east side of the lake (Jackson Lake Lodge side) can't be beat . . . anywhere. There were no clouds at sunset on our trip this year, so that time of day wasn't gorgeous, but the dawn the following day was spectacular . . . changing colors moment by moment."
221,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Avila Beach, CA ",If you are limited on time - take the breakfast cruise.,"We enjoyed our short visit to Jackson Lake. Traveling as a family of 13, we opted for the Breakfast Cruise as the way to cover the most area in a short time. Highly recommended."
222,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016,not available,"Wilson, NC ",Absolutely stunning area!!!,We hiked to Inspiration Point - everyone should take time to do this as it was amazing. The ferry and General Store as well as The Transformation Chapel should be on everyone's list of have to do's. The only problem was the Jenny Lake remodeling so parking was a little hard to find but not impossible.
223,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Salento, Colombia ",Don't go with Colter Bay Scenic boat tour!!!,"While the lake itself is absolutely beautiful, just wanted to put word out there to not book with Colter Bay marina (part of Grand Teton Lodge). My family made a reservation way in advance and the company refused to honor it because the group sales office had not communicated to the marina. Horrible service. Didn't even apologize for their gargantuan mistake."
224,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Solon, OH ",A day at the lake,"I can't say a day was enough, but we drove most of the way around the lake, and it is beautiful. The area is a bit remote, so either bring your own food or be prepared to do some serious looking."
225,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Philadelphia, PA ",Nice Cruise,The cruise service on Jackson Lake offers a short but pleasant ride across the lake to a point where you may hike up the mountain to Inspiration Point. If you're interested in climbing the peak which is about 500 feet above the dock this is a worthwhile trip to take. Otherwise it's just a nice interesting way to see the lake.
226,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",Rent A Boat!,"We were planning to rent kayaks but it was cheaper for us to rent a motor boat so we did that instead. What a beautiful view of the mountains!    We saw osprey and lots of birds.    There weren't very many people on the lake so we had a nice peaceful day.    Our boys were interested driving the boat so since we practically had the lake to ourselves, we got to give them their first lesson in boating!    Bring lots of sunscreen - we forgot to reapply and got a bit burned"
227,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016,not available,Tennessee ,Beautiful Lake,"We stayed right on the lake at Signal Mountain Lodge. It didn't matter the time of day, the views were amazing. We even went canoeing and swimming there."
228,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Cedar Rapids, IA ",Words can't express the experience...,"Stayed a week in the area in our RV and it was painful to have to leave... Everything we love to do was available and affordable. Nothing like it anywhere that's kept so pristine with such natural beauty. We took bike rides in the woods that have such a unique aroma that I just dream about it.  Hiking was very picturesque, and then taking a swim afterwards just has to be the most amazing way to see the shoreline..."
229,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2016 , Friends,"Fremont, CA ",Very huge Lake with multiple beautiful view points,"If you are visiting for the first time and coming from south towards Yellowstone you pass through Grand Teton and this is a part of 42-mile scenic drive. Even though there are many other beautiful lakes, Jackson lake has its own charm and beautiful, especially during sunset due to easy accessibility and visibility. Yellowstone lake is more beautiful."
230,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Houston, TX ",A must do stop to view the mountains,"We stayed in Signal Mountain Lodge, and stopped by this lake several time just to view the mountains. Highly recommended. Also one of best viewing areas is the Jackson Lake Dam."
231,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Magna, Utah, United States ",Beautiful mountain lake,"Due to the unique structure of the Teton Mountains (i.e. one tectonic plate thrust up while the other slide down) Jackson Lake is snuggled up against the sheer rock face of the Tetons (none of the normal foothills usually accompanying mountains). At its deepest, Jackson Lake is over 450 feet deep. Several moraines (hills created when glacial material is deposited at the leading edge of a glacier) can be seen in and around the lake. This is a unique and beautiful area."
232,Jackson_Lake,May 2016,not available,"Huntsville, AL, ",Stunning views,Jackson Lake is a perfect view point for pictures with the still water and mountains in the back making it perfect to stop.

234,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Phoenix, AZ ",Enjoy the hikes and take the boat tour,We spent 2 days in the Grand Tetons and could have done more. We did the evenings in Jackson Lake Lodge area and and rest of time hiking and auto touring around the park. We did the boat tour from Colter Bay after a morning of hiking out to Taggart Lake. It was very informative and offered beautiful views of the Teton range. The boat is enclosed but allowed you to go on deck although quite chilly even at 2pm in late June.
235,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Jackson, NJ ",Wherever You Are on the Lake You are in Heaven,"The views on Jackson Lake and around the lake are spectacular and not to be missed. Walk, drive, and boat on Jackson Lake provide a chance to see the Tetons and fall in love."
236,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Guangzhou (å¹¿å·žå¸‚, ä¸­å›½) ","huge lake, amazing view","It's worth to rent a boat to explore Jackson Lake. It is so huge, we started from Signal mountain lodge port, heading to west and the north, we took great pictures of the montains in the river."
237,Jackson_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,"Market Drayton, UK, ",Beautiful views over the lake to the mountains.,I have looked at the other reviews and to be honest I just agree with all those that describe the lake and the reflection of the mountains and the sky as amazing. You can just sit and stare and never get bored. Lots to do in the area but we just loved taking in the vista and the wonderful fresh air.
238,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Centennial, CO ",Beatiful,"The reflection of the Tetons in the lake in the early morning is absolutely fantastic. Water is cold of course, but we saw people frolicking in the water nonetheless. Nice hikes around."
239,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Prairie du Sac, WI ",One of a kind mountain setting,"The Teton Mountains are most inspiring, rising over 4,000 feet from the floor of the Jackson Hole Valley. This location, however, puts the large Jackson Lake in front of the mountains, their reflections magnified off the water. Add to this the large range of wildlife in the area and you find it is a destination that can't be missed. The vantage is especially beautiful from the Jackson Lake Lodge with the large wall of windows beautifully framing the lake and mountains. We saw elk, moose, fox and heard rumors of bears in the area."
240,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Canberra, Australia ",spectacular,One of the best views looking out over the lake with the mountains in the background. The colour of the water is a sensational blue/green.
241,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples, ,Beautiful lake & mountains = perfection!,"Traveling to the Tetons, we look fowarded to seeing the mountains. But Jackson Lake was just as nice. Picnic areas available also, to view the scenery while you take time for refreshment!"

244,Jackson_Lake,May 2016 , Friends,"San Francisco, CA ",Stop here at sunset,"The background for sunset is picture perfect. You get mt. Moran and the grand Tetons reflect off the lake waters for a glorious sunset. There are picnic benches, so would be a good place no matter what time of the day it is.  The water is calm and very zen-mode like. Perfect place to relax and unwind with nature."
245,Jackson_Lake,May 2016 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Lovely lake with a beautiful mountain backdrop,"Jackson Lake is deep and cold - great for boating and wading, but chilly for swimming. Take a few minutes and skip some of the beautiful rocks. Pelicans frequently hang out by the damn."

247,Jackson_Lake,May 2016 , Family,Wisconsin ,Excellent View of the Tetons,"This is the largest lake in the Grand Tetons National Park.

248,Jackson_Lake,May 2016 , Friends,"Glasgow, UK, ",Awesome views,"After travelling thru Yellowstone you would imagine that you couldn't see better views. Then you hit Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake.

249,Jackson_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,"Melbourne, Australia, ",Stunning,Having spent the prior days in Yellowstone we were surprised by the remarkable beauty of the lake  Some of the scenery near the southern entrance to the park is simply breathtaking
250,Jackson_Lake,Apr 2016 , Family,"Yakima, WA ",Serene field of snow in early April,Visiting here in early April provided my family with very little interference from other travelers.

251,Jackson_Lake,May 2015,not available,"Alabaster, AL ",Gorgeous lake,Pack a picnic and stop at one of the many picnic areas overlooking Jackson Lake with a marvelous view of the Tetons. You cannot get much more serene than a quiet view of this lake.
252,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Kansas City, MO ",Almost as pretty...,"So this really, really scenic lake has the distinct disadvantage of being 30 minutes away from the stupendously pretty Jenny Lake. Jackson Lake is good for boating and has nice (rocky) beach options for picnics. Definitely plan time at Jackson Lake during your visit."

Certainly, I would not even try if the person to whom I was speaking had never been. We drove through on a frosty, cold October morning. The sun was bright, the sky was clear and blue, the clouds were in little wisps and the ground cover was pinks, yellows, browns and all was beautiful. Put this on your bucket list now if you have never been."

257,Jackson_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples,"washington state, ","Lovely, especially in fall hue","We stayed at Jackson Lodge and were blessed to view Jackson Lake in her morning, afternoon and evening hues. We hiked the Landmark Trail at Coulter Bay and saw more of this magnificent lake. They had stopped the river cruises by the time we stayed at the Lodge, but we'd readily book that the next time we explore the Park. The Tetons form a fantastic backdrop for the lake and that's fabulous grist for photographers of any stripe. What a gem of the jewel called Grand Teton National Park!"

285,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Monticello, MN ",Wow,It was very beautiful. It was also nice to see how they operated the dam before everything went electric.
286,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Charleston, SC ",Rent a Boat,"The boat rental prices at Signal Mountain Lodge are reasonable. We enjoyed spending some time out on the lake seeing the Tetons up close from different angles. Even if you don't get out on the lake, just viewing the mountains across the water is so beautiful."
287,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family, ,A Lot of Fun,We had a lot of fun on the lake. We rented kayaks and went out on the lake. The pictures we got are better than postcards. We pulled up to some of the islands to explore. We also took a 2 hour fishing trip and caught multiple lake trout. That was a really fun trip.
288,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Arlington, VA ",Beautiful lake against the tetons,Amazing view of the Tetons on a lake that is not crowded with boats. It is a must see for anyone looking for memorable beautiful photographs or just to take it all in. N

290,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Great Neck, NY ",Take the boat trip,Our room over looked the lake and the mountains and we took a boat trip around the lake. It is beautiful and seems very clean and well kept.
291,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Las Vegas, NV ","Rent a boat, get a great view",We rented a boat for a couple of hours and had a great time. The best part is that you get views of the Tetons that you can't get from anywhere else. The boat rental prices are pretty fair.
292,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Louisville, KY ",Beautiful!,"Jackson Lake is a beautiful , blue clear lake at the base of the glorious Grand Teton mountains. The lodge there is really pretty and has a wonderful view of the lake and mountains. Just can't say enough about the beauty of this area of the country."

295,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Kidderminster, UK ",Part of the scenery!,"Not my favourite bit of the Tetons. The view of the mountains is ok, but to me its just a big lake. The dam with the water bursting out of the end of the lake was the best bit. Definitely stop here as you pass."
296,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Gilbert, AZ ",So much fun,The lake was amazing to swim in!!! Loved it so much! great times!!! we will be back next summer!!!!!!!!!!!!
297,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Rockledge, FL ",Wonderful for a Walk or Picnic,"We stopped at the Jackson Dam and walked around there. The lake in general is clear and dramatic against the jagged, rugged mountains. There are plenty of picnic areas and lots of boating. Great place!"
298,Jackson_Lake,Aug 2014 , Family,"Plainfield, IL ",Picturesque quaint and relaxing,"You can't help but enjoy the beauty of the lake. When you take  the Lake cruise you will get a lot of history about the lake, the tribes the different type of settlers that came to the area and  if children are with you they will enjoy it as well. They are very safety conscience with all that are aboard."
299,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Frisco, TX ",Excellent fishing,Booked a guided fishing trip at the Colter Bay Marina. Captain Pat (who is also a part-time chef) guided us to nice catches of lake trout which fed our entire group of 12. He filleted the fish on the boat and even gave us some delicious recipe suggestions for the preparation of the fish later that night.
300,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Jackson Lake,"We found this to be a good place to make arrangements for activities as boating, float trips in this area. You can also make  arrangements at Colter Bay. Jackson Lake Lodge has a grill, lounge, nice dining area with a great view of the Tetons. It can feel however very congested with the crowds here."
301,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Liberty Hill, TX ",it is Very Nice,"Clear water with the Teton as a back drop. Try the boat ride or breakfast on the island, both are pretty cool."
302,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,Mint Hill ,Be sure to go see the Jackson Dam.,"What a feat of engineering. Take a few minutes, whether you are an engineer or not, and go experience what has been accomplished by thought, calculation and determination. Bring your camera, and possibly hearing protection. We were there after a rain and the percussion was pounding!"
303,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"South Hamilton, MA ",Family Vacation,Jackson Lake and Jackson Lake Lodge is an absolutely beautiful location to visit and dine in the Grand Tetons. Spectacular views and very well maintained.
304,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"San Diego, CA ",Stunning Views and Amazing Rock Beach,"We stopped here quickly for some photos. The lodge was packed, but we just kept driving down to the shoreline. It was pretty empty down there. There was a long rock beach where you could walk the shoreline as far as my eyes could see. The rocks were all perfectly round from the waves of Jackson Lake. The view of the mountain was great from this beach. I recommend stopping there and taking a stroll."
305,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015,not available,"Glendale, New York ",Fantastic,"Jackson Lake Lodge was beautiful place for the whole family. The view of the Tetons from the Libby is spectacular. My cottage was very nice, clean. Although no AC it was very comfortable. Service was very good."
306,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Grosse Pointe, Michigan ","Mural Room, The best meal of our entire trip","We chose to eat in the Mural Room, shortly after our entry into the Park, as we drove south from Yellowstone. Jackson Lake Lodge is a gorgeous spot, nestled on the shore of the Lake, with large picture windows and comfortably chic western decor. My husband had the duck, with a delicious coconut couscous, and I had trout, generous enough to share, with polenta and unusual spinach.  By all means, if you are looking for a nice souvenir of your visit, the shopping here us the best in both of the National Parks."
307,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Friends,boston ,Beautiful!,"We mostly just viewed this lake while driving to Yellowstone National Park. Beautiful spot. Large, sparkling lake."
308,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Family,"Plano, TX ",Best lake in America!,warm water in July and an excellent organic pizza joint to feed the health conscious. Could't be happier with a place for the family
309,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Fabulous!!!,"This is a great outdoor recreation area. So much to do for families, singles, couples etc.  And many lodging options."
310,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Santa Fe, NM ",Stunning,Jackson Lake is huge. It is so beautiful when you look across it with the Tetons as a backdrop. There are several locations where you can swim and it looks like there are plenty of boat docks.
311,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples, ,Kayak at Signal Mt Lodge,"Absolutely loved the recommendation we received to go kayaking at Signal Mt Lodge on Jackson Lake. View was breathtaking. Pretty quiet and nit very busy when we were there in the early afternoon. Boats for rent there also, but was pretty peaceful and serene out on the lake taking in the gorgeous scenery. Would highly recommend!"
312,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Union City, CA ",Beautiful!,"Each day we enjoyed the views from Jackson Lake! The mountain views, wildflowers and lake change with the light and offer so many opportunities to be in nature and savor the seasons. Oxbow was a favorite area nearby to watch for animals. We saw a moose and water fowl. The boat ride on the lake is a treat."
313,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Friends,"Sedona, AZ ",LOVELY CRUISE TO BELOW MT.MORAN,"If you would like to go on the cruises with lunch, you have to book before 8 am the same day so would recommend doing it the day before. I believe the cruise with lunch stops at Elk Island and takes about 2.5 hours; the regular cruise is 1.5 hours. We just took the cruise across the lake. No bathroom facilities on the boat but this is emphasized before we left. Beautiful scenery and we saw a bald eagle and a nest with (big) chicks. Very relaxing and serene."
314,Jackson_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples, ,Perfect mirror for the Tetons,"What a view of the Tetons with lots of amenities including camping sites , restaurants, boat docks and trails."
315,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Edmond, OK ",Rent kayaks at Colter Bay Marina,"We wanted to get on the lake and rented two single-person kayaks for 2 hours from Colter Bay Marina. It was an enjoyable experience and provided a different perspective of the area. One kayak rent was about $18 per hour. I strongly suggest getting to the Marina when it opens (8:00 am) or soon after. Kayaks and canoes are snatched up quickly! When we returned at 10:30 am, there were people waiting for boats to return."
316,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Titusville, ",Jackson Lake Lodge View,"We were driving from West Yellowstone to the 42 mile Scenic Loop of the Tetons and stopped at the Jackson Lodge to view the Lake from the rear of the lodge. There was a lady with a full grown falcon giving a talk and it was quite interesting. The view of the mountains with the lake in front is majestic and worth the stop. There are other great views of the lake along the road, but there is something special about seeing it from the lodge. Hint: Park away from the busy entrance and walk to the lodge entrance, then along the right as a path leads to the viewing area. There are places to sit and enjoy the Lake view. You may elect to lunch at the Lodge."
317,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,Virginia ,Great place to visit,The lake is beautiful and is a beautiful forefront to the amazing Grand Teton Mountains. It is in the Grand Teton National Park and offers many options for visitors.
318,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Indianapolis, IN, ",WHAT A SETTING !!!,"It is hard to think that it could be any better........just a perfect place in nature.    This might well be the gem of the park although the scenery was awesome everywhere. Be sure to make the stop here and also go into the Jackson Lake lodge, go up the stairway and soak in the view through the windows....then go out onto the 'patio or deck' to take in all the beauty."
319,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Tampa, FL ",Great Bike Trail,we rented bikes at Adventure Sports at Moose Junction. The trail is a total of 16 miles! I never thought I could ride that much since I am not professional bike rider...but the trail is very easy to follow and the scenery is just gorgeous. The Grand Tetons are in your background the whole time and once you arrive to Lake Jenny you know it was well worth the ride. Once you return you can go to Dornan's restaurant and sit outside and watch the sunset over the Grand Tetons.. You cannot ask for better ending to a day!
320,Jackson_Lake,May 2015 , Family,"Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, MN ",Most beautiful sight you'll ever see,"Make the stop and check this out. Stop by the Jackson lake lodge, have a beer and a bite and bring your cameras because the view is unbelievable! Don't bother staying at the lodge but I recommend stopping by."
321,Jackson_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Naples, FL ",Amazingly beautiful,Have always wanted to experience the Tetons and finally got the chance. I was not disappointed. Mt Moran is magnificent and doing a water cruise is highly recommended.
