0,String_Lake,Aug 2021,not available,"Durham, NC ",A gem near Jenny lake,"This is a beautiful lake next to Jenny Lake that many people frolic in. There's also a trail that loops around the lake which is one of the easier walks you can take a family on. There are multiple parking lots serving this lake and Jenny lake which tend to fill up quickly during the day, so go early or late to be able to get a parking space."
1,String_Lake,Aug 2021,not available,"Oshkosh, WI ",Get there early,Arrive early in the day to find a parking spot. We hiked the 3.8 mile loop around the lake. The trail on the east side is easy but becomes moderate as you loop around to the west side. The trail also connects to several other trails. Trails are well signed. There is a boat launch and picnic places.
2,String_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"Charlotte, NC, ",Swimmin' Hole!,"I feel like String Lake is one of the better kept secrets of Grand Teton, and it's possibly because it's parking and access is limited, so make sure to arrive early.  The lake is 10ft deep at it's deepest point, so it is absolutely perfect for swimming in crystal clear water that you can see all the way to the bottom.  Do be aware of wildlife in the area, we say a moose, a bear and a snake while here. There are lots of people so no real need to be worried about potential danger, but just be aware and make sure your kids are too.  The beach access here is very limited, so like I said arrive early and claim your spot. Also, make sure to bring a kayak or paddle-board to fully enjoy String. It's a magical lake and one that we could've spent longer at if we had the time. I highly recommend it."
3,String_Lake,Jul 2021,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ","Smaller, Less Crowded Lake","The pro here is that String Lake is much less crowded than Jenny Lake, but the con is that it's also a little less scenic. There are some trails in the area for hiking, and you can access Leigh Lake nearby from those trails. We were already a little hiked-out by this point, so we just walked around the picnic area instead."
4,String_Lake,Jun 2021,not available,"New Jersey, USA ",Yup: much less crowded than Jenny Lake!!,"A less-crowded gem. Beautiful lake in the Tetons, incredible views, easy access, large parking lot. So much more pleasant than Jenny Lake crowds."
5,String_Lake,Sep 2020,not available,"Lakeside, CA ",A less crowded alternative to Jenny lake,Jenny lake was continuously over crowded with no parking available. String lake was a little better and just as nice although there's no boat ride available there.
6,String_Lake,Aug 2020,not available,"Spokane, WA, ",String Lake Put on your hiking boots you will enjoy the hike.,"We found the parking challenging at String Lake, we had to drive round and round and pretty much follow someone as they were leaving. But the challenge was worth the wait. We took the hike around the lake and it was beautiful. There was lots of people enjoying the water of the lake swimming, relaxing on floats and the picnic area was quite nice and a great way to finish off a hike.  Take the time to hike the lake you too will enjoy this hike. FYI it does link up to Jenny Lake Hidden falls trail if you missed that hike, it is beautiful as well. Enjoy and put on your hiking boots."
7,String_Lake,May 2020 , Family, ,Less Crowded than Jenny Lake,"There were very few people on this trail. We hiked Jenny lake first and came back the next day to hike this one. The solitude was great, the views are just as good, not as much wildlife (or it just wasn’t out) and the trails are very similar. Weather was beautiful but still lots of snow near the top to the point where it was tough to see the trail. This entire area is breathtaking."
8,String_Lake,Jul 2020,not available,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Beautiful. Not too crowded (compared to Jenny Lake),Beautiful lake. We enjoyed hiking around it. There were people relaxing on the lake beaches. It was a tranquil place to
9,String_Lake,Jun 2020,not available, ,Early Morning,Started out at 620 AM and we were the only ones on the trail the entire time. Went out to Leigh Lake Sand Beach and back.
10,String_Lake,Oct 2019,not available, ,Amazing views over the lake,"Very nice and amazing natural veiws while on this walk over the lake , don't miss this out and it does worth it."
11,String_Lake,Jul 2019,not available,"Laura, OH ",Do you like to swim in cold water?,"I do! This is beautiful, picturesque swimming hole. There is plenty of shoreline to find your own little beach. Nice place to get away from the crowds and cool off, even when the park is busy."
12,String_Lake,Aug 2019,not available,"Bountiful, UT ",Leeches in String Lake!,"I've always loved String Lake because it is sooooo beautiful. But when we were there at the end of Aug. 2019, for the first time we got in the lake up to our knees because we've noticed other people starting to do this. We got out after an hour only to discover my 6-year-old granddaughter's legs were covered with leeches--one big one and about 25-30 small ones. We were absolutely horrified and panicked as we pulled them off of her. I spoke with a ranger after who was very calm (I was glad) and said we'd ""fed the wildlife"" and the leeches wouldn't harm my granddaughter. I still never want to step foot in String Lake, however, and will hike around its perimeter. Oddly enough, only my granddaughter got the leeches!"
13,String_Lake,Aug 2019 , Family,"The Hague, The Netherlands ",Beatiful lake,It seems that we were really lucky since we arrived and we found a parking spot.  The lake is very popular but it is amazing. It reminded me the photos of the canadian lakes.
14,String_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Nice Swimming/Wading Hole w/difficult Parking,"Very tough paring problem here, which is too bad. it's being loved to death. This is a swimming and recreation hole on a small lake. Fun to walk around. Fun to swim, paddle, etc. Unfortunately everyone else apparently things the same."
15,String_Lake,Jul 2019 , Family,"Lutz, FL ",Beautiful,Parking is horrible but beautiful crystal clear lake with beautiful Mountain views. Very cold but eventually you'll get used to it!
16,String_Lake,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Peoria, IL, ",Easy but beautiful hike,"The great thing about hiking around String Lake is that you can get incredible views just steps from the parking area and can hike as far as you want. We chose to hike out to Leigh Lake, so instead of turning and doing the loop of String Lake, we just hiked one side of it and kept going out to Leigh Lake (about 2 miles RT). I would recommend doing this so you get two alpine lakes instead of one.    String Lake is a gorgeous blue-green color and so clear. Many people were out kayaking, canoeing and SUPing the day we visited. We enjoyed a snack on the shore for awhile just watching everyone enjoy this gorgeous lake and then completed our hike. This was probably the busiest hike we did in GTNP, but it never felt overly-crowded. It was way less crowded, for instance, than any of the hikes we did in Zion NP. The parking does fill up, so I'd plan to come in the morning and maybe enjoy a picnic lunch post-hike."
17,String_Lake,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Laramie, WY ",A Good Beginners Hike,"The String Lake hike was OK for a warm up in the Tetons or if you have small children or less fit hikers along. Its an easy trail, mostly, until you hit some of the inclines on the mountain side. Experienced hikers will probably find this trail too crowded, especially late in the day and compared to other hikes in the Tetons, the views are not as dramatic. If you're time is limited but you like to hike, take some of the more challenging canyon trails."
18,String_Lake,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",Our First Hike in Tetons!,"We hiked String Lake on June 17. There were 8 of us ranging in age from 7 to 70. We hiked a total of 4.25 miles, according to my husband's apple watch. We saw beautiful reflections of the mountains in the lake. It was really scenic. We also saw a marmot. There were a ton of mosquitoes on this trail. Even with mosquito spray, we needed to keep moving.    This trail is also used by horses, which means there is poop all over. Pay attention where your feet are going. We walked through the aftermath of an avalanche with lots of broken trees and packed down snow. That was really cool to see. The total hike took us about 3 hours. This included stops for pictures. There were some spots that were under water on the trail, so we had to go around. Not a big deal, and we really enjoyed this hike."
19,String_Lake,Jun 2019 , Couples,Houston ,"A Favorite Hike - Easy, Beautiful","Really enjoyed this short, easy hike around the lake. Beautiful views of the lake & mountains. Good for kids."
20,String_Lake,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Cary, NC ",Beautiful Views,"String Lake is easily accessed from the parking lot. You can take just a short hike and see some amazing views. The day we visited people were enjoying picnics, canoeing, SUP and kayaks. A very calm and peaceful way to spend a few hours.."
21,String_Lake,Jun 2019 , Family,"Spring Hill, TN ",Great hike with our grandkids,"We hiked the trail around String Lake which is flat so our 7 year old grandson hiked it. Our 4 year old however got carried a lot. It’s a beautiful hike with lots of lakeside views. I recommend it, kids or no kids."
22,String_Lake,Jun 2018,not available, ,Quiet beauty,String Lake is a wonderful small lake at the base of the mountain. It is shallow and warms up a little more than the surrounding lakes and is a great place to soak your feet!
23,String_Lake,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Raynham, MA ",Easy Hike,"We hiked along String Lake in October. It was an easy hike along a quiet and less crowded lake. The water was a beautiful shade of pale green and with the mountains in the background, it made for a calm and peaceful walk. There are picnic tables also and plenty of parking."
24,String_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Sheboygan, WI ",Great Wooded Location with Mountain Views And Water,"String Lake has so much to offer in the Grand Teton National Park, such as hiking trails, picnic areas, wildlife, water activities and mountain views.  On a calm day, there are good photo opportunities for mountain reflections in the lake. Hiking trails are well defined, ample number of tables in the picnic areas and restrooms.  Plenty of parking is available.  A must see location with in the Tetons."
25,String_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"United Kingdom, ",Lovely setting,"Quieter than Jenny Lake but still with stunning views. You can hire a canoe and paddle out and families treat it like a mini beach and sit and play or picnic. There's a walk which we didn't do, content to stand admire the view. Plenty of parking."
26,String_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,Fort Atkinson ,"Pretty setting, but not the Teton and lake view of postcards.","Easy to get to. You can see the lake on a couple of trails, and drive to it on park roads. Picnic area. But there are other lakes in more scenic locations in the park."
27,String_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Juneau, AK ","Great, easy hike",This was our first hike in the Tetons. It's a great hike for families and the scenery is awesome. Hiking this trail early in the morning may be best to avoid crowds.
28,String_Lake,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Shelby, MI ","Quiet hiking trail, lovely lake with picnic and beach area",String Lake is an extremely gentle short hike. There is a possibility of seeing wildlife on the walk. There are tables for picnicking and plenty of space to sit on the beach. Many people used Stand Up Paddleboards on this lake.
29,String_Lake,Sep 2018 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA ",Super pretty view.,"Super pretty view. Nice trail. Paddle boards, canoes and kayaks. Some areas not too deep. The boaters would step out of their boats and wade in the middle of the lake. Very clear lake."
30,String_Lake,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Rochester, NY ",String Lake Hike,"This is a nice flat hike, out and back along the Lake. You can extend the hike on a few other trails that intersect. Be sure to buy the local trail map to maximize your hikes."
31,String_Lake,Aug 2018 , Friends, ,Quiet scenic lake with a good view of the Grand Teton,"This is not as popular as Jenny Lake but less crowd means more peace and quiet for you for enjoying the view and taking pictures. The view of the Grand Teton from String Lake is not the best one, but it does have its charm. With adequate parking you might just want to check it out yourself."
32,String_Lake,Sep 2018 , Family,"Eagle Mountain, UT, ",Beautiful walk,"It’s a great place for an easy hike along the shoreline. We walked up to the neighboring lake. We didn’t have kayak or canoe, but next time we will."
33,String_Lake,Aug 2018,not available,"Leicester, UK ",Amazing,Really scenic lake right at the foot of the mountains. A great place to hike or just to relax by the side of the water. Also looked to be a good place to Canoe or paddle board as it was pretty calm though you have to take your own as there is no where to hire them unlike at Jenny Lake. Parking is fine as long as you get there before 10.30. In my opinion it is better than Jenny Lake.
34,String_Lake,Aug 2018 , Couples,Arizona ,Beautiful Lake with nice views of the Tetons,Beautiful Lake with nice views of the Tetons. Nice short little paddle if you are kayaking or canoeing or paddleboarding etc. We kayaked it and it was very nice. Walked the portage to Leigh lake but portage was not our plan. Dollies would be a good idea for the portage if you don't feel like doing the carry. Lake was very nice. Got on early at about 0830 and there was only 2 kayakers and one paddle boarder on the lake. When we left at about 1230 the place was packed so best to be there early. I didn't feel like 0830 was early but it did the trick.
35,String_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Manchester, UK, ",Lovely Hike round a Beautiful Lake,"We went to Jenny Lake as everyone told us we should but the car park was being rebuilt and it was overrun with coaches so we took the nearby Scenic Drive and stopped at String Lake.  We started walking toward Leigh Lake but then took the trail up and around String Lake. It was really quiet, we hardly met anyone else and the views were great, both up and down the hill.  The track breaks up in some places so you do need sturdy shoes."
36,String_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Hasselt, Belgium ",We did a lovely hike to Leigh Lake and walked alongside String Lake.,We took a short walk to Leigh Lake and walked alongside String Lake. People were swimming and using their canoes on String Lake. The reflection of the Grand Teton Mountains in the lake is perfect. Watch out for musquitos : they are viscious.
37,String_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family, ,A must visit!,"Although a bit cool, since it is a mountain fed lake, it is one of the best swimming and paddling lakes in the area. It does not get much deeper than 5-6 feet in most areas, so great for younger kids. Plethora of ""put-ins"" for wading or paddle boards. Can get pretty busy after 10-11am, so grab a spot early!"
38,String_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Boston, MA ",Great swimming in beautiful setting,"It is an awesome experience to swim and have the GRand Tetons around you. No lifeguards, so watch the kids! Many picnic tables around. An easy walk from the parking lot. Just a real treat to relax and enjoy this lake."
39,String_Lake,Jul 2018 , Family,"Kirbyville, MO ",Gorgeous hike and lake,"This is an easy hike for young kids if you stay around the lake. There are more complicated hikes that you can take beyond String Lake. The water in the lake is crystal clear. It’s gorgeous. There are lots of places to go swimming. The lake is shallow in lots of areas. The water is cold, but it’s nice to stick your legs and feet in after you’ve been hiking. There are lots of camping sites along the lakes through this area. Love this hike."
40,String_Lake,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Mission Viejo, CA ",Very refreshing,"Wanted to take a dip in the lake after completing the hike around Jenny Lake. We had read that it would be better to swim here than in Jenny Lake as it was not as cold. Good thing we took that advice as the water here was not warm. We guessed it to be about 70 degrees (Fahrenheit). Once we finally got the nerve up and submerged, it was great. Very refreshing. Tip: take some beach chairs as the ground is not really that comfortable and there aren’t many places to lay out."
41,String_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,Illinois ,Enjoyable hike,We enjoyed our hike around String Lake. The first half of the hike was close to the lake and the second half was closer to the mountains. The second half was hard--not flat and level like the first but we enjoyed it all.
42,String_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Arley, AL ",Beautiful String Lake!!,"My family, including two young children, had a picnic and hiked around String Lake! It was so peaceful and not nearly as crowded as other lake areas in the Tetons! We had a great time! Our kids wanted to swim, but it was around 60 degrees, so we decided not to."
43,String_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"Madison, WI ",good hike with small kids,"The 3.7 mile string lake trail is perfect for hiking with young kids. Not too many steep inclines or cliffs, with fun bridges to walk over."
44,String_Lake,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Murrells Inlet, SC ",Soothing Sylvan Setting,"A short drive off the loop road brings you to this serene setting at the base of the Grand Tetons. The quiet waters invite the canoe and kayak enthusiast to launch and enjoy the great views. The small picnic area also beckons for a snack stop or to relax with a book. It is in the picnic area that, years ago, I met a grizzly bear who scampered behind me as I sat reading a book, unaware of his presence until other tourists shouted a warning. The bear proceeded up a path, stopping to eat berries alongside the lake, posing for photos with tourist only a few feet away."
45,String_Lake,Jun 2018 , Family,"arlington, va ",Beautiful and Hidden,"Our nephew, a local, took us to String Lake to paddle board and canoe. It was beautiful, empty and a perfect adventure. There was plenty of parking -- which you won't find at many close by locations, and easy water access for water toys. Good fun!"
46,String_Lake,May 2018 , Business,"Jackson, WY, ",Simply splendid!,"But it’s become increasingly popular and well known. Come earlier in the day to beat the crowds. Early season is excellent too but beware the trail is often submerged till mid June or later. If you come in July, the beaches will be utterly thronged. That being said, I love the picnic area and I love the rock for jumping from and the trail to and up along Leigh Lake.  This place is just so accessible and so gorgeous, being snug up against the base of the Mt. Saint John group of peaks.  The hike all the way around the lake is a joy, too."
47,String_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Chicago, IL, ",Perfect mirror reflections,"There are 2 trailheads on String Lake:  1) String Lake trailhead: connects south to Jenny Lake  2) Leigh Lake trailhead: connects north to Leigh Lake and has picnic area  There is a 3.7 mi/6 km loop trail around the lake.    We visited String Lake around 5pm on a Wednesday in August. Unfortunately, it was about to rain, and we didn't want to risk getting stuck in the rain while hiking the String Lake Loop, but we managed to squeeze in the 1.8 mi/2.9 km hike to Leigh Lake. Even on a cloudy day, String Lake looked beautiful and serene. As the shallow lake narrows towards Leigh Lake, it formed perfect mirror reflections of the Teton Range (see photos). Trail condition was good, and it was not crowded. We were lucky enough to see a deer on the trail."
48,String_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Healdsburg, CA ",Wow! What a find.,"Stumbled upon this lake and wow was it a find. Although we visited in September the beach at this lake was packed out with young families enjoying the lake.    It was low key, laid back and very nice. A nice hike adjacent to the lake was a treat too.    If you want a relaxed day at the beach, go here."
49,String_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Boone, NC ",serene.,"A ranger recommended this hike, and it was well worth it! Not too hard, the lake itself was so calm and peaceful, and the hikers we encountered were respectful of how peaceful this place was."
50,String_Lake,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Naperville, IL ",Good Trail!,"Trail around String Lake was the best one we hiked. We are in our 50s - not in great shape, so finding a good hiking trail within our abilities made the trip to the Tetons. Great view of the lake - easy to follow trail."
51,String_Lake,Sep 2017 , Solo,"Moscow, ID ",scenic loop trail,"The loop trail around this lake is very scenic and not strenuous. There are good views of the mountains and, when you get to the west side, there are good views out to the east. The aspens on the west side were at peak color when i walked the loop -- very beautiful. Also, as it was late in the season, there were fewer people. It's an easy walk that takes about 2 hours, if you take your time."
52,String_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Kenosha, WI ","It's great, but choose wisely!","String Lake is fabulous! It's small; it's mostly shallow (just inches deep, in some places!), which means it can actually warm up some in the summer; it's got drop-dead gorgeous views of the Tetons; it's easily accessible by car, which means you can get your kayak or canoe or stand-up paddleboard in easily; it's got a nice hiking trail around it; and, we've almost always seen wildlife while there.    But those are also the drawbacks of String Lake. Of all the lakes in the Tetons, you can drive up to two: Jackson Lake, and String Lake. That makes this a very popular spot. The fact that it's shallow and can actually warm to tolerable temps makes this a popular swimming hole for families with small kids, for teenagers wanting to romp around, and for others. The trailhead here leads to trails south to Jenny Lake, north to Leigh Lake, and to several nearby canyon trails. In other words, it can get very crowded, very quickly. If you've come to the Tetons to get away from crowds, well, String Lake may or may not be the place.    We come here almost every year, because it's so easy to put in a kayak. But the key is either to do so early (parking gets tight pretty quickly), or to put in and then kayak north and portage to Leigh Lake, which is bigger and has the advantage of being accessible only by hiking and/or portaging.    But if you go early, you can be rewarded. We chose String Lake on August 21, 2017, the day of the total eclipse. Strangely, very, very few other people did, so we had String Lake virtually to ourselves!    When you put in at 7:00 am, almost every lake is very calm. That morning, String Lake was like a mirror. We saw ducks, herons, an eagle; elk and deer; and, of course, the eclipse.    In the past, we've seen a bear along the trail -- indeed, it actually swam across the lake, and right at the spot where the vast majority of people were!    So, String Lake offers you a variety of choices. If you want solitude, get there early and get away from the parking lot and the main put-in spots for the lake. If you want to swim or splash, stay close to those spots. Either way, the scenery is undeniably stunning.    I cannot guarantee you'll see bears, or eagles, or herons, or elk, or deer at String Lake. It's a pretty good bet you'll see ducks. But you will find something you like. Enjoy!"
53,String_Lake,Aug 2017 , Family,"Kansas City, KS ","Crystal clear lakes, incredible mountain view!","We actually backpacked way back to a camp site we had reserved months before, past String and Leigh lakes. All the lakes are absolutely stunning - but the crowds around String Lake in particular is ridiculous. We had to park our car overnight along the main road because the big parking lot was overflowing. Leigh lake was also very busy, but the further you hiked in, the less congested it became, and well worth it. All camp sites have a bear box to keep your food in. We did not encounter any bears, just a marmot and a very curious deer. A trip of a lifetime!"
54,String_Lake,Jul 2017 , Friends,"Northampton, UK ","A gorgeous, easy walk","Still rather jet-lagged, we chose this as our first hike in Grand Teton. The walk is easy and passes through woods, over a pretty river and then rises up to the edge of open meadows. Astonishingly, we saw a grizzly - a good distance away but still extremely impressive. Carry bear spray, just in case!"
55,String_Lake,Aug 2017 , Family,"Leighton Buzzard, UK ",Beautiful,Varied walking along the water and up in the forest. Lots of water activities. Stunning views. Peaceful
56,String_Lake,Aug 2017 , Solo,"Sedgefield, South Africa ",great walk,"There is a easy paved trail. Swimminf, boating, picnicking. Trail goes around half of the lake. Wet lands at some of lake edge. Can be crowded near parking lots."
57,String_Lake,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Charlotte, NC ",Tranquil and beautiful hike,"I love the Grand Tetons - even more than Yellowstone. We did the four mile hike around String Lake because we didn't have the time to do the 7 mile Jenny Lake hike. It was pretty easy - you're in the shade most of the time but in the back half you gain a bit of elevation. We did the hike around 930-1130 am and the trail was quiet - we were alone most of the time which I really enjoyed. The lake is beautifully clear, and I recommend taking a dip in it. Several families were doing so near the picnic area. You cannot beat the view of those majestic mountains with a clear alpine lake. We also used the picnic area right after our hike - I highly recommend bringing your lunch in a cooler and relaxing after your hike. This hike was one of my favorite experiences of our time in GTNP and YNP."
58,String_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Blacksburg, VA ","Easy, scenic hike and great place to paddle.",We took a short hike along String Lake toward Leigh Lake. I wanted to be on the lake in a kayak. Perhaps I can do this next time. There are several hiking options from this area.
59,String_Lake,Aug 2017 , Family,SETX ,Do It!,"Ok, so after falling in love with Jenny Lake and the alpine-lake feel (mountains with lake and forest), woke up at 530am and took my wife to hike the String Lake loop with a peek at Leigh Lake. Very easy walk - about 4 miles - and part of it is on the side of the mountain, but once you get to the east-side, amazing views of the lake with mountains in the back-drop. This is a easy hike for people not up to strenuous summit climbs or steep hikes. We saw beautiful vistas and some deer.    We took the kids back to have a picnic as the String Lake picnic area is amazing.    If you want a great walk/hike, love alpine lakes, bring some food and hike it and eat at the picnic areas along the lake."
60,String_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Frankfort, Kentucky ",Just go already,"Clear to the bottom, a wonderful little excursion. Even better if you have a paddle craft for sunrise but also nice to hike around."
61,String_Lake,Jul 2017 , Couples, ,Great Short Hike,"String Lake Loop Trail is a 3.7 mile easy to moderate hike around String Lake, with 325 feet rise in elevation on the back side of lake."
62,String_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Round Rock, TX ",Easy and very picturesque,Suggest this hike for everyone. Lots of photo opportunities. Take bug spray. Saw many families with small kids who were enjoying the hike. There is one large elevation gain but it is very do able for anyone. Everyone in our group from age 14 to 65 enjoyed this and said they would suggest everyone go on this hike. You can also swim in this lake and it was shallow and very clear.
63,String_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Stockholm, Sweden ","Without s doubt, my favorite picinic spot on Earth","What a fabulous place. Notnonly can you sit and enjoy nature while you eat your picnic lunch, you can then follow it up with a walk through the woods to Jenny lake and back and then top it all off with a dip in the crystal clear waters of String Lake with the majestic Tetons watching ocer you. You would be hard tasked to find a more beautiful spot anywhere in the world."
64,String_Lake,Jul 2017 , Family,"Columbus, OH ",A Favorite place to picnic and hike!,We love hiking around this Lake after a picnic at the tables near the trailhead! Beautiful views and very easy walk. We like to go onto Leigh Lake and return the same route or the other side of String lake. One of our favorite easy hikes.
65,String_Lake,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Phoenix, AZ ",Nice Trail - Tough Bugs!,Hiking around String Lake looked like a nice options since the Hidden Falls Trail was inaccessible due to construction at the South End of Jenny Lake. The terrain was easy but I was totally unprepared for the swarms of biting insects. I still have one bite that is itching two weeks later. If you attempt this hike in June be fully prepared for the bugs.
66,String_Lake,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Orem, UT ",String Lake Loop Hike,"After days of bad weather, we were super excited to hike this loop trail. It starts out as more of a walk along the lake but after crossing the bridge it begins to climb just a bit. Not a hard hike by any means but it was pretty wet from all the rain. There were several places you cross runoff from the mountains. This hike is good for bird watching and other wildlife viewing. The lake is beautiful! If I remember right it was a 3 mile loop. Will go back for sure!"
67,String_Lake,Jun 2017 , Family,"Canton, GA ",Nice Hike around String Lake,"This trail was recommended to us by a ranger. He suggested it sot that we would not get stuck in all the construction traffic around Jenny Lake. It is listed as an easy hike and for the most part, it is . You go suprisingly high up and over the lake on this trail. You have the lake on one side and the mountians on the other. When we went in June there were parts of the trail that were flooded. We did have to walk around several areas to get back on the trail. If you are standing in front of the lake, we started walking to the left. Most people seemed to come from walking from the right of the lake because they passed us coming from that direction. I think you might have less uphill coming from that direction. We probably saw 10 people on the entire hike. We also saw a marmot basking in the sun. There were areas of this walk that you were not in any shade so be sure to bring some water. The lake seems very popular. There were people all around playing in the lake, picnicking and so forth. The water was so clear!"
68,String_Lake,May 2017 , Family,"Seal Beach, CA ","Great lakeside stroll, picnic area","The lakeside trail has picturesque, close-up views of the Teton mountains. An easy, even trail to walk. The picnic areas offer a great opportunity to enjoy the outdoors, but the day we visited (end of May) there were lots of users."
69,String_Lake,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Washington DC, DC ","Great hike, pretty views","We did the mild to moderate nearly 4 mile hike around String Lake. The hike was great - trails were well maintained, though there were still some snow patches in parts (particularly on the northwest side of the lake. Overall the views were great and hiking manageable (some elevation gain, but minimal). Would recommend if you're looking for a shorter, easier hike around a beautiful lake!"
70,String_Lake,May 2017 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Beautiful hike,Some difficult parts on the backside of the lake but overall a very doable hike for most people. We were still in snow and actually lost the trail for a bit but no big deal as long as you are woods knowledgeable.
71,String_Lake,May 2017 , Couples,New York ,Scenic and right at your feet!,String Lake trail offers spectacular views of the lake and the mountains. This is an easy trail right at the lake's edge in many spots. Highly recommend a stop at String Lake for a hike.
72,String_Lake,Aug 2016,not available,"Midland, MI ",Beautiful resting spot,We did a number of backpack hikes and found this lake an easy walk with beautiful scenery. Pack a lunch and enjoy the quiet if you have the time.
73,String_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Sioux City, IA ",Beautiful hike around the lake,"This is a wonderful hike around beautiful String Lake. It is about 4 miles roundtrip and I would say only moderately strenuous in a couple of spots. The parking lot was filling up fast as we pulled in. There are a few other trails in the area and on our return, a couple other trails intersected and it wasn't clear which way we should go. Our trail book wasn't helpful and the signage was clear either. We ended up having to ask one of the park staff that was saw nearby."
74,String_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",This is amazingly beautiful!!,"This little lake can be ignored unless you are looking for it. It is easy to find, and the beauty of its mirror-like waters just takes your breath away. It is a very short and easy walk that must be done."
75,String_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Fareham, UK ",Beautiful spot and lovely hike!,Only had an afternoon to spend in Grand Teton park on our way to Yellowstone and wanted to get out of the car and stretch our legs so chose the String Lake trail as its just under 3 miles and designated as easy! It was a perfect spot to spend a couple of hours and get a flavour of this beautiful park! Wished we could have stayed longer.
76,String_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Newark, DE ",Attractive little lake with a nice picnic area,"Brought picnic to enjoy at one of their numerous picnic tables, then let the kids wade in the lake. After a few minutes they asked if they could please come out because the water was so cold! Around the edge of the lake was far more crowded with other visitors than we anticipated."
77,String_Lake,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Gambier, Ohio ",nice easy stroll,This is a beautiful and very easy walk along the lake depending on how much of it you want to do. Recommend for a short afternoon relaxed jaunt.
78,String_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Boston, MA ",Great picnic place,"North of the Jenny Lake, the String Lake (and the Leigh Lake it connects to) is a great place for family time - picnic, kayaking, etc. There is a good sized parking lot at Leigh Lake Trailhead, with many picnic tables, bathroom facilities (with running waters) and close to the ""beach"". There were even people who unloaded the horses there. Since there are not a lot of restaurant options in Grand Teton, you should bring your own food, and String Lake area is probably the best place for picnic and family fun."
79,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Jackson, WY ",Great lake to swim with kids!,"This lake is great to have kids swim as it is very shallow. If you are kayaking, go to the end of the lake to the right then portage to Leigh Lake for a fabulous view and kayak there. String Lake is very crowded."
80,String_Lake,Aug 2016 , Friends,"Huntington Beach, CA ",A bit crowded but fun,"String Lake is a bustling spot. Parking is hard to find and people are everywhere. You can't leave food or items unattended along the shore. So if you don't have someone with them ready to chuck them into a bear box they are better left int he car.    There is a boulder jutting from the middle of the lake. It is an easy swim and great spot for little jumpers. There were a lot of first time rock jumpers and once they jumped they just kept circling around for more.    The lake is pretty shallow and it warmer than the other lakes. There are a lot of paddle boarders, if you have one this is a fun place to do it.    Just prepare for people to be everywhere. We just made a quick stop to dip in and then hike over to Jenny lake and the Canyon."
81,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Chicago, IL, ",Easily accessible!,Plenty of parking and it offers it’s own amazing views of the mountain right behind it. Designated parking for people with boats and horses.
82,String_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family, ,Bring the Kids!,"String Lake is the perfect place to bring the kids in their swim gear and floats. The lake is located between Jenny Lake and Leigh Lake. The scenery is stunning, the water is clean and cold and clear. While the parking is limited in the busy season and the beach area (rocks) can be crowded with other families, this is still a GREAT place to let the kids splash in the shallow water or venture a little further with paddle boards, floats, etc. The lake here is calm water and narrow, so while it is always important to be vigilant against water accidents, it is a far more relaxing place to let the kids try out than other areas (with deeper water or more of a current). The water is also glacier fed, and so is very pure and clean and gorgeous."
83,String_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Fernandina Beach, FL ",Beautiful hike around this lake,"We hiked the approximately 4 mile loop around this lake. The views were beautiful, and the lake water is so clear! Lots of people were swimming in the lake too, but it was a little too cold for us Floridians."
84,String_Lake,Aug 2016 , Family,"Sun Prairie, WI ",Gorgeous Shallow Mountain Lake,"This is a small lake between Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake that does not allow any motorized boats. The lake in early August was no deeper than 8 feet in a limited amount of spots. Rocky and sandy beaches give access to shallow easy sloping shores to the warmest water you will find in GTNP (not warm but not freezing either). The lake is perfect for a swim, SUP, iSUP, kayaks, canoes etc. It is bring your own everything here, no rentals, no food, no drinks etc. There is a picnic area with tables and there are bear boxes for food storage. Don't be discouraged by the lack of parking as many people use this as a base for hiking and camping the GTs, the lake is busy, but not too busy to enjoy. The lake is crystal clear and unfortunately the only fish other than minnows we saw were carp."
85,String_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family, ,"Gorgeous, scenic lake - small and accessible",Loves this lake - the hike around it was nice. enjoyed that it was smaller than Jenny Lake. I found it very beautiful with lots of easy access for wading/swimming. Wished I had a paddle board to take out on it.
86,String_Lake,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Great for families,This is a very beautiful shallow spot that is great for getting in the water and for family fun. It was crowded with lots of families and picnickers when we visited. Very family friendly.
87,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Jackson, WY ",Great place for kiddos to swim and play!,This lake is great for the kids but is also a great kayak start for those heading to Leigh Lake. It will take a short portage to get there but well worth the effort.
88,String_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Racine, WI ",Trailhead is deceiving!,"When you park in the string lake parking lot there is a sign at the trailhead right next to the parking lot that points to the right and says Leigh lake. This is also the way to string lake. If you go left there is a trailhead for string lake picnic area which is 3.3 miles, this takes you around for a view above the lake and is a long walk for those thinking you're going to go to the lake. Save yourself time and go right following the Leigh lake signs to get right to string lake. We took the trail to the left and ended up going straight instead of around and ended up at the other side of Jenny Lake which was beautiful with waterfalls and a tiny little beach all to ourselves, but not where we initially intended to go!"
89,String_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,"Littleton, CO ",Scenic Lake,We made a quick hike around the with the kids and had a good time. We saw lots of squirrels and chipmunks on the hike which made the kids happy. The hike is very easy as it is flat. There are also many places to take pictures from. We saw people canoeing and kayaking on the lake which seemed to be a popular activity given the number of people on the lake.
90,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Solon, OH ",Floating on the String!,"Since we had umpteen kids in our group, of course we bought our own rafts, hooked them all together and had a great float trip on the String. Yes, the river/lake is snow melt, so, no, it wasn't particularly warm, but the time spent was great family time and only cost us rafts at the local grocery store."
91,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,Indiana ,Beautiful Short Hike,"We decided to take an easy trail after a day of longer, steeper hikes. We were at the lake very early in the morning -- maybe by 8:00 or earlier, and we didn't see another soul until we were ready to leave. We took the trail counter-clockwise to enjoy the views of the mountains reflected in the lake. The only downside: mosquito colonies. We made it about a third of the way around when the mosquitoes and flies descended. We decided to turn around because they weren't as bad where we had been. For some reason, once we were farther from the lake and in more of the trees, they were much worse. Still, it was a beautiful way to spend some time in the morning quiet."
92,String_Lake,Jul 2016 , Family,North Carolina ,Perfect place to Stand Up Paddle or Kayak,"We rented some Stand Up Paddleboards and everyone said this was the place to go. Have to agree with them. It never seemed more than 4 feet deep and you can see to the bottom the whole time. Unbelievable to SUP with the mountains as your backdrop. Easy place to park and unload and then plenty of space to get on the water. If you want to learn or even get out for a quick workout, check out String Lake."
93,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Arlington, VA ",The place to go for crowds and Mosquitos,Don't get me wrong....this is a beautiful lake....but this is NOT where you want to be if you can't handle Mosquitos (hoards of them everywhere) and crowds. I would guess this is where tourists go who don't have the energy to go on more of the longer hikes in the area? We had no problem at all with crowds or mosquitoes at the Laurance Rockerfeller Preserve and all the hiking there....but we could not even enjoy our picnic lunch here by String Lake due to the mosquitoes. We got out of here as fast as we could.
94,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Sandy, UT ",Great place to kayak,"Stunning views of the Tetons, beautiful clear water. Love this lake it was great fun with our tandem kayak"
95,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Guangzhou (广州市, 中国) ","clean water, quiet place","the water fo string lake is crystale, the best place of water sports and BBQ in Teton Park. We walked along the river bank and crossed the bridge of Leigh. only few people around there."
96,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Family,"Savage, MN ","Pretty lake & view, busiest trail we hiked",It was scenic and very flat but there we so many people at 10am that it became not enjoyable. There were a bunch of canoes and kayaks in the lake making lots of noise too. If you do this park in Leigh parking and walk up from there for a better chance at solitude.
97,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Centennial, CO ",nice,"All the lakes are nice in the park. This is not as popular as other lakes or hikes, but is pretty convenient."
98,String_Lake,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Fort Myers, FL ",beautiful lake,the lower trail from the parking lot is easy and has great views of the colorful lake. if you choose to take the high/far side of the trail around the lake expect some heavy uphill walking and to get out in the deep woods.
99,String_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,North Carolina ,Beautiful!,"Park at the String Lake Trailhead and go clockwise around trail. Everyone else is going counter-clockwise, but we loved our views and the trail going the opposite way. Look at our view!  Easy trail."
100,String_Lake,May 2016 , Couples,"Salt Lake City, UT ",Good hike,"The hike around String Lake is about four miles. Even if you are not interested in completing the entire hike, take a walk on the easier parts around the lake. You should be able to see some elk or other wildlife."
101,String_Lake,Sep 2015 , Family,"Preston, ID ",Mixed feelings,"String Lake was not that impressive: however, there is a hike from the same starting point that takes you to the north end of Jenny Lake that was breathtaking."
102,String_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Columbus, MT ",Excellent Hike Easy Rating,An Excellent hike with an easy rating. Beauty you can relax with. Only at one end of the trail does it become confusing as many trails converge and cross by the String Lake Picnic Area.
103,String_Lake,Sep 2015 , Family,"Utah, ",Serene lake,"Pretty little lake, nice to just walk the trail near the lake or walk in the lake or have a picnic along the shore. Get there early if you want to stake out a good spot for yourself. Good lake to kayak on. (:"
104,String_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Philadelphia, PA ",Great Hike,"There is a great trail that starts at this parking lot and takes you across Jenny Lake. You can get to Hidden Falls and Cascade Canyon from this trial also, which I found preferable to taking the boat across Jenny Lake."
105,String_Lake,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Atlanta, Georgia, ",Nice Hike for two hours,"The String Lake trail is well marked and has varied elevation all with beautiful views across the Teton valley, the lake and mountain sides. The trailhead has old but functional toilet facilities. The trail is not handicapped accessible. Water sports are permitted on the lake and swimming etc. is at your own risk. The trail is shared by hikers and horseback riders who have the right of way."
106,String_Lake,Sep 2015 , Business,"Jackson, WY, ",Peaceful,"Avoid the July crowds by arriving early, or come in September. It has the shortest yet most lovely Teton park trail imaginable!  Swim out to the big rock in August and jump off of it!  But do secure your food please. Careless people kill bears."
107,String_Lake,Aug 2015 , Friends,"New Lenox, IL ",Little gem of a lake!,"One of the workers in the visitors center of Jenny Lake said this was her favorite lake, so we decided to check it out. We got in our car and followed the signs to get to the picnic area of String Lake. We then walked out to the trail area and walked along the lake a few hundred feet both ways. We found it to be absolutely spectacular and pristine with crystal clear water. My absolute favorite lake in the Grand Tetons! It was picture postcard perfect."
108,String_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Park City, UT ",SUP & Kayak with kids,"We had an amazing day at String Lake. There is a rock in the middle to jump off of. There is a big patch of lily pads. Bears were spotted the day before but we didn't see them. The lake is very shallow, maybe 6 ft, so the kids could SUP & kayak without worry. One of our favorite places during our stay. Don't forget to register your SUP with the ranger."
109,String_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,St. Albans ,kayaking on String Lake and then over to Leigh Lake,"We rented Kayaks from Dornan's. They were able to secure our kayaks to our car. We started at String Lake which was perfect for families. Kids were able to get out and swim. We even saw a bear from the Lake. Elk were also seen walking across this Lake as it is shallow. Following String Lake, we took the 150 portage over to Leigh Lake. This was a bit of work transporting 2 double kayaks over but definitely worth it. Leigh Lake was beautiful as well. Must kayak to the Paintbrush Canyon as well....spectacular!!"
110,String_Lake,Aug 2015,not available,"Venice, Italy ","Great family hike String Lake, Jenny Lake, Inspiration Point","Avoid the Jenny Lake crowds and drive to String Lake trailhead and hike from there up to Inspiration Point. This was the highlight of our trip to the Tetons. This hike can be as easy or hard as you want it to be. There are some spots of uneven ground (its a hike mind you) and we hiked after it rained and hiked back in the rain (remember to heed the warnings and pack your rain gear). If you want an easy 3 mile hike with beautiful scenery then just hike to the Jenny Lake boat dock, we hiked approximately 6.5 miles"
111,String_Lake,Aug 2015 , Family,"Washington DC, DC ",Great spot to take a break with the kids,"After a long morning of hiking, String Lake is a great place to cool off and relax. A popular swimming area, the water is ""warmer"" because the lake is shallow. Get there early in the day or early afternoon, because on a hot day the parking lot is packed!"
112,String_Lake,Jul 2015,not available,"Saint Martinville, LA ",Great easy hike along the water.,"Loved this hike along String Lake and Leigh Lake. We ended up going about seven miles but it was flat and easy with beautiful views of the lakes and the mountains. We started pretty early, which was a good idea, as it really gets crowded later in the day."
113,String_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Colorado Springs, CO ",String Lake,This was an easy hike. It is also popular. Get there early. Many folks were putting in there water gear to enjoy the day. Nice area for a picnic after the hike.
114,String_Lake,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Chevy Chase, MD ",Most fun...,"Jenny Lake was so crowded so we went north. What a surprise! The String Lake and Leigh Lake areas, just immediately north of Jenny Lake, have beaches to cool your feet and gentle hiking trails with good views of the lake. There were many families with canoes and swiming gears, chairs, food and drinks. The water was shallow, clean, and calm. One nice man invited us to sit in their chairs, because he saw the two of us eating our takeout lunch sitting on the ground. We did not bring our swimsuit or any other gears. But we enjoyed taking off our shoes after a hike (3.8 mile around the east side of the lake) and soaked our feet and legs in shallow water. We enjoyed a very relaxing day there."
115,String_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"San Jose, CA, ",Beach fun,"We were lucky enough to find a parking spot at Leigh Lake trailhead at about 1pm in June- String Lake trailhead parking was completely full. From there, we walked about a mile along the eastern shoreline of String Lake until we reached the bridge, took a quick peek at Leigh Lake, and then walked back. The mile was mostly flat and dirt-packed with a few ups and downs- very easy.    Both lakes are pretty, but String Lake is a very popular and busy spot! There’s a picnic area near the parking lot, and as we walked along the lake we saw that each open area of shoreline had a small group camped out with blankets, chairs, umbrellas, etc. There were kayakers and paddle boarders on the lake, plus a few brave and chilly swimmers. It looked like a great way to spend the day.    But if you have time for only one lake hike, I would recommend Taggart Lake over String Lake and Leigh Lake."
116,String_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Annapolis, MD ",Gorgeous place to swim or kayak,"This was my favorite spot in Grand Teton! The mountain views were amazing and the kids were able to swim in the cool, shallow water. Lots of families were there with kayaks, paddle boards and rafts."
117,String_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Austin, TX ",Nice moderate hike around lake,"Pleasant walk through many fields of wildflowers. Some ups and downs and lots of people, but that's because there are many places to wade into the water and/or do some paddling. Water is VERY inviting! Nice picnic area near the lake, but hard to find an unused or shady table."
118,String_Lake,Jun 2015 , Family,"Evanston, WY ",Second Time Back,"The first time I came here was with my fiancé and it was breathtaking. So peaceful and beautiful! This most recent time was just as beautiful but it was busier with tourists, naturally. If you want to visit and don't mind staying out of the water, go in the off season or even winter. First time visit was in the winter and i was blown away. But it sure looked like everyone with kids was having a great time. Awesome place to picnic and/or swim! Bring the bug spray for sure! And if you swim just remember, it IS a glacier lake..."
119,String_Lake,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Tel Aviv, Israel ",A nice fairly easy hiking trail in the park,"There is a loop around this very nice lake in the park. The east side has a lot of small rocks in the trail and ascends a bit, as well as moves away from the lake. The west side is flat and goes along the lake shore. The lake itself is quite nice and there is a good view of it (as well as of Leigh Lake just to the north) at the upper end. figure about 2 1/2 to 3 hours."
