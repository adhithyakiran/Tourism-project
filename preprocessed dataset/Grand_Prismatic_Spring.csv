0,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2021,not available, ,A must see!,See this from ground level and up above! It was the largest spring we saw on in Yellowstone. Small parking lot so get there early. There is a place to turn off before the spring where you can hike above spring so you will have an elevated view of the spring. I recommend taking the hike. We didn't because we didn't have enough time before sunset. We walked around the boardwalk which was awesome.
1,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,United States ,The Icon of Hot Springs,"I've seen photos and video, but I definitely wanted Grand Prismatic in-person when I visited Yellowstone. I recommend viewing at ground level on the boardwalks but then doing the short hike up to the overlook. The view is definitely best from the overlook. It's truly a natural wonder and sort of the icon of hot springs."
2,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2021,not available,Illinois ,Spectacular!,Wow! I absolutely loved the Grand Prismatic Spring. I just wish I would have found the trail that went to the overlook! Yellowstone possesses the most unique and beautiful sights I have ever seen. We spent one day touring from the West entrance to the South entrance. I'm looking forward to a return visit to see more!
3,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2021,not available,"Argyle, TX, ",Beautiful Hot Spring,"Grand Prismatic earns my vote as the most beautiful active hot spring in Yellowstone. Take a walk around it in Midway Geyser Basin, then drive to the overlook trail which also leads to Fairy Falls. It is well worth the short hike to view the wonderful colors and geothermal activity."
4,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021 , Family,"Elk Grove, CA ",A must see,"The Grand Prismatic is a must see in Yellowstone! I would really recommend doing the .6 mile hike to the overlook if you are able, as it is spectacular from above. If you’re entering Yellowstone from the West Entrance I would recommend you go to the Grand Prismatic first, then do the overlook, and then head to Old Faithful. It will be busier at Old Faithful later in the day, but that area is built to hold crowds. The Grand Prismatic area has a smaller parking lot and doesn’t absorb the crowds as well."
5,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2021,not available,"Slidell, LA ",Grand Prismatic Spring,We were here after it had snowed and the trail to the springs was very slippery. Fell a couple of times. And by the time we got to where the spring was could not see the beauty of it because of the steam from being so cold outside. But I'm sure it is beautiful.
6,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Point Lookout, MO ",Gorgeous especially from the overlook,"Going down to the spring and walking the boardwalk is a must, but I think the hike up to the overlook was great and the view was amazing. Continue to the falls on the hike for an awesome set of pictures"
7,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2021 , Solo,"Tallahassee, FL, ",Beautiful Spring But Crowded,I visited Grand Prismatic Spring around noon. The place was slammed and I had to wait in line for about 30 min to get a parking spot in the lot. The views of the spring from the boardwalk are good with gorgeous colors visible through the rising steam. The best views are from the Fairy Falls Trail which is accessible from a different trailhead. Next time I intend to do that trail. It’s a great spring and worth seeing.
8,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2021,not available,"Palm Desert, CA ",Worth the hike!,"I never would have left Yellowstone Park without seeing Grand Prismatic Spring. It was well worth the hike just to capture a picture with those beautiful colors. You could settle for the walk on the boardwalk, but the hike offers such a better view."
9,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2021,not available,"Durham, NC ",A must see,The Grand Prismatic spring is truly the most scenic pool we saw in the park. There is a trail that loops along it in the basin and another viewpoint on a hillside further away.
10,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2021,not available,"Tyler, TX ",Must see,This was one of the highlights of the trip. We did the hike to the overlook and this had awesome views. We continued on the Fairy falls and to imperial which is definitely worth the hike.
11,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Moncks Corner, SC ",Beautiful feature,It was a foggy morning when we went but trust me- you can hike it! There was an 80 something year old woman on the overlook and she handled it like a boss- you can too!! It had snowed the night before so it was very slippery but worth it.
12,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2021,not available, ,"If you can't hike, don't bother","If you cannot hike to the overlook, don't bother. You are at the same level as the spring, and you cannot really see it like in the pictures. There is a very slippery 4 foot Trex boardwalk around the spring, with NO GUARDRAILS!! You are surrounded by scalding hot water and bacteria, and no rails!! People were scaring us half to death by letting their little kids go to the edge!"
13,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2021,not available, ,Grand Prismatic Spring,"After hiking the .8 mile trail from the parking lot we were treated to one of the most amazing sights you will ever see. Take your time on the way up and enjoy, its everything you see in the pictures and more. We walked the boardwalk at 7am and there was a good amount on steam on a 40 degree morning. We made the climb mid afternoon and were not disappointed. Stunning"
14,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2021,not available,"Fort Worth, TX ",Undescribable,"This is one of those places that you see pictures of and wonder if someone photoshopped the colors. Trust me, they didn't. It is even more extraordinary in person! Be sure to walk to the overlook on top of the hill to get the best view!"
15,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2021 , Family,"Des Moines, IA ",A must see from above,"Our family‘s favorite geyser in Yellowstone! If able take the hike to the overlook to really see the spectacular colors. There are plenty of places to stop on the way up, take your time. Like with everything in Yellowstone go at your leisure and your own pace."
16,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2021,not available,"Maumee, OH ",Beautiful!!,"First, this is just a beautiful sit from above! From the ground, it is average. So to get the full affect, you need to take the small paved hike to the top. Second, parking is sparse, so get there early to beat the crowds."
17,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2021,not available,"Oshkosh, WI ",A beautiful sight,We biked to a point where you could take a short uphill walk to an overlook. You can also walk to the overlook from a parking lot. The view from the overlook is much better than the one from ground level.
18,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2021,not available,"Hackettstown, NJ ",Make sure to see at ground level and from above. Stunning!,"If you are doing the lower loop from West Yellowstone in the summer GET UP EARLY! We went through the gates around 6:30 AM and were rewarded with sunrise views over the river as we entered the park. After a few other stops we arrived at Grand Prismatic around 9:00. The parking was crowded but we were still able to get a spot. First we walked the boardwalk path along the outer rim which was impressive but if you want to see it in all its colorful, beautiful glory you must get back in your car and drive a little further down the road to the overlook trailhead. It is a very short walk to the overlook. This view is spectacular. After that you can continue on to view a waterfall or go back to your car."
19,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Cincinnati, OH ",MUST DO - plan wisely.,"For the most part, the best way to beat the crowd in Yellowstone is to get to your point of interest early in the morning. However, for Grand Prismatic, would suggest rolling the dice and do late afternoon - perhaps early evening. If you go in the morning, their still may be a fog hangover, and the lack of sun will diminish the experience. We went around 4:30, and will unable to get into parking lot, it was a short walk. This place is glorious - nothing else like it on the planet. It has a tie-dye effect of colors wiith organge, red, yellows through out - maginficant."
20,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Sacramento, CA ",simply outstanding,we just did the overlook and it was mind blowing. Best time to see would be during mid day as the steam gets intense during cold temperature
21,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,"Burnsville, MN ",Go to the overlook at Fairy Falls just south of the actual sprints,"Go to the fairy falls trailhead and take a short hike (just under a mile) to the overlook. This gives you the full view of the spring from up above. You can see all of the colors (especially the blues in the center) much better from up here, rather than standing on the boardwalk around the spring at ground level."
22,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"San Antonio, TX ",Amazing - must see!,Highlight of Yellowstone - don't miss this area. If you can get parking (we did!) then there isn't a ton of walking like a lot of the other areas. This is easy to walk around and see the amazing beauty.
23,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available, ,Great view of the spring,"Definitely worth the hike to the overlook on the Fairy Falls Trail. Several people told us it was too steamy to see the spring up close, so we skipped it completely at the next stop, but really enjoyed seeing it from the overlook."
24,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Sandown, NH, ",Hike to the Overlook,"Parking at the spring itself on this day stretched down the road and was backing up traffic. Go to Fairy Falls Trail head instead, the parking was better as were the views from the top. Nice hike and views on this hot summer evening."
25,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Denver, CO ",Huge and Colorful,The trail out was a little longer than expected but the view is amazing. Definitely the largest and most colorful geyser in the park. The viewpoint is worth taking the trail out versus the parking lot at the bottom. Parking a bit more limited.
26,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ",One of the best views,"This spring is particularly large and colorful. You can see it up close on the walkways, or you can hike a little ways up to the overlook for an aerial view. it is very impressive because of the colors."
27,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2021 , Couples,"Mooresville, NC ",Amazing!,"Really enjoyed the geysers. Due to the sleet, ice and snow it was difficult to see the colors of the geyser. The overlook would have helped but it was closed due to the sleet that day.    Don't miss this stop!"
28,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Concord, NC ",Highlight of the park,Take water! It is a little walk yo get there but so worth it. The colors are unlike anything I’ve seen in nature. We took some beautiful pictures.
29,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021 , Family,"Apple Valley, CA, ",Amazing!!!,Absolutely amazing what’s happening to these springs as they are changing every day. Beautiful colors throughout the different springs. No matter where your at you’re going to get an amazing picture. Definitely 💯 recommend this to everyone.
30,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,"Arlington, VA, ",Stunning Views,"The Grand Prismatic Spring was the rally point where I was to link up with my family. While people will know what you are talking about when you say “The Grand Prismatic Spring”, it is also known as the “Midway Geyser Basin” and you’ll find it faster on the map that way. This place, like much of the park, has limited designated parking spaces. I made two passes by the “Spring” before finding a place to park alongside the road and walk back a mile or so to meet my family. Like much of the park, there is limited cellular service. So, keep that in mind when trying to link up with your party. There was a raised one-way walkway around the “Spring”. There are many spectacular views of brilliant orange colors in the water features, with deep blues in the centers and steam coming off the surface of the water that stimulate the senses. Side note: There were two outhouses in the parking area for the springs."
31,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,Michigan ,Take the Hike to the Overlook,"If you want a good photo of the Grand Prismatic Spring, don't park at the Grand Prismatic Spring because you'll be too close to it. To get the photo you want, you'll have to park about 1-2 miles down the road and then follow Fairy Falls hiking signs, which will take you to the overlook of the Grand Prismatic Spring. And, if it's foggy out, just forget it because you won't see much of anything."
32,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021 , Family,"Denison, TX ",Beautiful!!! Must see!!,"There were a lot of people when we arrived, but that didn’t stop us from thoroughly enjoying the area! Beautiful geysers & the colors are amazing. To see it from above, there is a trail that leads up above from a different area. We stayed down below & still enjoyed them!"
33,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Mount Laurel, NJ ",Must see from platform .,This was a place I had to see . The platform to the spring was a hike I would recommend going to the bathroom first before hiking around here no bathroom at the fairy falls parking lot . I loved the view from up top . We could get into the parking lot was told to go to fairy falls lot and walk up to platform . Great advise go to fairy falls lot to see the springs
34,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,"Cleveland, OH ",Did the overlook,Trail to overlook and at the top were pretty busy. I think you must try it. Great view and pictures to be had.
35,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021 , Family,"Las Vegas, Nevada, USA ",Grand Prismatic Spring & Excelsior Geyser Crater are national treasures,"This area at the midway geyser basin is the most unique place that I visited. Being close to them feels unreal and I appreciate the blue colors of Excelsior and the orange and brown colors of GPS. It's a privilege to visit this place. Although the parking areas needs to be expanded more than double of its current size, the wait to park is much worth it."
36,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,"Honolulu, HI, ",Fog was surround the area so no good viewing,I was really excited about visiting the Grand Prismatic Spring but the morning that we arrived fog covered the whole area and viewing the spring and other natural formations were obscured.
37,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2020,not available,"Chesapeake Beach, MD, ",Fairy Falls Trail and Overlook is a Great Option for Viewing all of Grand Prismatic,Note that parking is hectic at Grand Prismatic. We found that carefully parking along the road and walking to the entry and boardwalk was the best option. To view Grand Prismatic in its entirety go down the road (in the direction of Old Faithful Lodging) and park at the Fairy Falls Overlook Trail. Expect to hike for a bit (about 20 minutes depending upon your pace.) The trail splits and you need to go to the left which will take you above for a great view. We also found that the pics we took in the early evening were better than early morning.
38,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,"Birch Run, MI, ",One of the highlights,"Beautiful colors, easily accessible, well worth your time to visit the Grand Prismatic Spring while in Yellowstone National Park. I can't wait to go back."
39,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,North Carolina ,worth it!,Take the trail head to Fairy Falls just far enough to visit the spring's overlook! It took about ten extra minutes and was well worth it!
40,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2021,not available,"Porto Alegre, RS ",Colorful Hot Springs,"Nice walk around hot springs leading up to the Grand Prismatic Spring. Beautiful hues, but a little difficult to see the whole picture due to the angle of the boardwalk. Lots of people when we were there. Parking an issue."
41,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021 , Friends,"Houston, TX ",Screen saver come to life,"We arrived at the Grand prismatic spring parking area at around 1pm... it was packed. Once we managed to find a spot we proceeded up the Fairy Falls trail which was wide and well traveled. There was an overlook trail which had a pretty steep incline, but was fairly short. Once at the overlook many people were courteously waiting turns to take selfies and high resolution photos of the natural wonder. We came down the other side of the trail and continued on. We reached the turn off for Fairy Falls 1.6 miles... pretty far we decided to go and added an additional 5k to our already long hike... the pay off was okay... a bit of a wipsy waterfall... got back to the car exhausted having walked over 5 miles..."
42,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,New Mexico ,"Great view from above, if you can, take the hike","The main site walk to the spring is underwhelming. Although you see much of the discharge water running off, and you can walk ground level around the spring to get a sense of the size, even tall people cannot see the beauty of the colors. To see the beauty of the colors - the prismatic part - like the pic here - you need to park at the alternate access points and hike or bike in. There are two, Fairy Falls for a hike in - about a mile with a hike UP much of the way, or the bike way up road which will still end with a hike in. The bike path is about 2.5 miles. Having now done both, I wouldn't bother with the main access. Time wasted in my opinion"
43,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,"Santa Monica, CA ",Very impressive and memorable,"This hot spring is famous as the largest in the United States and the third largest in the world. Best to come early and probably no later than 9 AM. After that, there is quite a backlog in terms of traffic trying to get into the parking lot or at a nearby parking spaces. There are no stairs so you can bring a stroller on the complete loop by each spring and without any problems. The spring itself is piping hot and all of the steam can obscure the bubbly water below."
44,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021 , Family,"Pearland, TX ",Gorgeous colors!,Gorgeous colors and beautiful!! So amazing to see that many colors in one thermal element. Take the overlook trail going to Fairy Falls. Much better view. Summer 2021 = tons of tourists!!
45,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available, ,Beautiful Colors,Walking around the spring was amazing. It is great to get a scale for how large and how blue the water is. A must is to take the short hike up the Fairy Falls trail to see the views of the Spring. That is the only way to really see the overview of the entire spring and the brightness of the colors.
46,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,"Virginia Beach, VA, ",The place to see the Prisms !!,Go check this place out and see the prisms and the magnificent colors and see the steam come from the water. Go up to Ferry Falls and look out at the vantage point that it offers. The camera shots are amazing. One of the most pretty spots on the earth.
47,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021 , Family,"Doylestown, PA, ",From another planet!,"One of the most popular places in the park, and for good reason, another attraction you will want to get here early for. You can drive down to the Ferry Falls trail and hike a short hike to the overlook and view this spring from above (highly recommended) or you can just head to the Midway basin for a ground level view. Neither will disappoint!"
48,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021,not available,"York, PA ",Absolutely beautiful on a sunny day,You must try to go on a sunny day. Our day was very windy but sunny & the colors were stunning. You need to be careful walking on the boardwalk but it seemed to be safe. It is a longer walk that what I expected but totally worth it. The parking is horrendous. We had to wait in line the whole way from the road to the parking lot to get a spot. Some were parking on the road & walking down. There are 3 beautiful springs to see at this area & a very pretty river also. I definitely recommend making this a priority to see.
49,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021 , Couples,"Moreno Valley, CA ",Awesome Big Colorful Spring !,"The biggest, most colorful Spring is worth seeing ! But be warned as sometimes depending on the weather conditions it put off a lot of Steam that blocks your viewing."
50,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2021 , Couples,Florida ,Take Fairy Falls Trail to the Grand Prismatic Spring Overlook,"The Grand Prismatic Spring is majestic and awe inspiring, the trail to the overlook is worth the wait and of course locating parking is worth any inconveniences experienced. The overlook platform is often filled with visitors trying to get that perfect photo. The weather also plays a role in determining if the Grand Prismatic Spring photos are crisp and clear or fuzzy. There is also a point on the trail before the overlook, where you can see most of the Grand Prasmatic Spring, yet the best view is from the overlook."
51,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2021 , Family,"Sneads Ferry, NC ",Take the overlook hike!,Save your time and pass the parking lot! Take the fairy falls hike and follow the overlook path! It’s a steep incline but I promise it’s quick and so worth it! You can see it soooo much better from an upper vantage point.
52,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Apr 2021,not available,"Riverside, CA, ",Breathtaking Color,"We visited here twice during our trip in late April. Our first visit was on a windy and stormy day and it was hard to see the colors, but our second visit on a sunny and calm day allowed us to see all the brilliant colors and intriguing textures. Try and hike the entire boardwalk or the longer hike above. Unforgettable in the right weather and lighting."
53,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2021,not available,"The Woodlands, TX, ",Another Must See,Beautiful in the cool morning mist. Enjoyed walking around and viewing up close but you could see most of the area from a distance.
54,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2021,not available,"Vallejo, CA, ",Must Visit,"A little bit of a hike to take in all that Prismatic has to offer, but we'll worth it. Pretty amazing to see steam sprouting every, and all of the different colors. Plenty of photo opportunities."
55,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2021 , Family, ,Stunning,"Absolutely beautiful! We hiked the trail to the overlook and the view from above was amazing, 1000 times better than in the boardwalk."
56,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2021,not available,"Pierre, SD ",Weather made it bad,"When we went in late May, the trail leading to the top was closed and the day was rainy. Could see the steam and the outside and that was about it. Was super excited but turned out to be an ok as the weather didn't cooperate."
57,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2021,not available, ,Trail to view from above was closed,"This was a disappointment, because being at the same level as the spring it was not possible to see the colors. It was a cool morning so much steam/fog, so we really didn't see the spring. But the surrounding springs gave a good idea of what it would have looked like."
58,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2021,not available, ,I'm Sure It Was Beautiful,"Couldn't wait to get to see this. It was a cold, rainy day and when we walked up to the top of the ramp to view it, all we could see was steam and the outlying orange parts. Will have to go back and try again some day."
59,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020 , Solo,"Anchorage, AK ",See the best viewpoint by leaving the boardwalk!,Don’t just stay on the boardwalk! Go further down the road to the Fairy Falls trailhead and see the amazing Grand Prismatic from above to really get the best perspective. It’s a moderate trek and the reward is fabulous!
60,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Hike to the top,"Somehow in my previous 3 trips, I had never been here. On this trip, we hiked the lower trail next to the spring and realized that was not the best view. We could see people on a trail up above. We went back the next day and found the upper trail and it was well worth the hike for the amazing views of Grand Prismatic Spring."
61,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2020,not available,"Seattle, WA ",The Big One,"This is the granddaddy of the springs. The rainbow colored giant spring was beautiful to behold. So much that we came back for a second look on the last day of the trip, and encountered a snowstorm, and thus got to experience the sights (or lack thereof) another way."
62,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2020 , Family,"Chanhassen, MN, ",Fairly Falls Trailhead for Best View,The Grand Prismatic is visually stunning and although the close up views are good you really should take the Fairy Falls trailhead to the overlook for the best view. In addition the FF trailhead parking is far less congested and in my opinion just a better experience of the spring. The trail is an easy walk with just a small portion of the trail being moderately challenging.
63,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA ","Stunning, otherworldly, colorful","Hands down, this is one of the most unique things you will ever see in your life.    There’s more than one colorful bubbling spring on the trail around here and they’re all pretty big.    The biggest one has every color of the rainbow.    There are two different ways to see Grand Prismatic Spring:    1) There’s an overlook that gives you a view from above to get the best look at all the colors.    2) There’s a handicap accessible walkway that gets you up close and personal.    I recommend doing both, if you have the time.    The parking lots for Grand Prismatic Spring are a lot smaller than some of the other attractions at Yellowstone, so be mindful of that if you come here on a busy day. You could get stuck either having to park farther down the road and walk or sit in a long line of cars waiting for parking spots to open up. It’s still very much worth the time and effort to see this place."
64,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020,not available,"Maple Grove, MN, ",The overlook is the must see viewpoint for Grand Prismatic Spring,"While the view is good from the Midway Geyser Basin boardwalks, the best view is from the overlook on the Fairy Falls trail. It is still a crowded path, even on a cold day in September, but the view from above is much better. Because of the temperature, the steam from the geyser wasn't the best for pictures, but no matter what the view and perspective is much better from the overlook. The hike up to the overlook is relatively easy and the path mostly very wide. Because the overlook is relatively new, I found the descriptions of the location of the trailhead to be somewhat confusing. Just know that it is the Fairy Falls trailhead."
65,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020,not available,"Valparaiso, IN, ",Very beautiful spot,I don't know where people go to get these overhead views of the spring. We only found the trail that goes along the surface. You don't get the best view of the colors but it is still very cool and pretty.
66,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2020 , Couples,Georgia ,Avoid this area when snowing or icy.,"First off: this place is drop-dead beautiful. The springs are lovely - when you can see them. We saw the edges of all of them, due to it being a bad-weather day. The steam hung right on top of Grand Prismatic and we couldn’t see much of it. Which we’re fine with: the Park Service can’t control the weather. 😂    Having said that: we thought it would be cool to see the hot springs in a snowstorm. And it was - until the boardwalk iced over and no one could walk without slipping. The parts made from wood were fine; the parts made from plastic decking turned iced over within minutes. My husband and I slipped and slid, along with several other people, on the small boardwalk on top of boiling hot springs. A walk that should have taken 5 minutes took almost 20, while the wind picked up and the snow was driving down. We survived, yes, but it was most unpleasant.    Bottom line: avoid the boardwalk area if it’s cold enough for precipitation to freeze.    We look forward to returning on a sunny day to see the spring!"
67,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2020,not available, ,Enjoyable,Grand Prismatic Spring and surrounding area was so neat. It was very cold while we were there so all the springs were blowing off massive amounts of steam! Nice safe visit.
68,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2020 , Family,"Sellersburg, IN ",Just ok,"We specifically went to see this area twice in one day...needless to say neither time yielded a good shot. We went early and with the cold, there was so much steam coming off, you could barely see it . We went back later in the day and although slightly better, the view didn't improve much. From above it may be awesome, but ground level...just ok."
69,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020,not available,"Bothell, WA ",More Than Must-See!,"This is one of the most beautiful sites you'll see in Yellowstone Park or, for that matter, anywhere in the USA. The colors of the spring along with the lovely forested backdrop (with river and mountains in the background) bring just about ever color in the artist's palette into your eyes.    Easily reached from the main road, the spring is part of a series of sites that you'll see while walking the boardwalk. Beginning with the runoff into the river from the spring and geyser you will then encounter the highly colored (due to thermobacteria) spring itself. Continuing on you'll pass Opal Spring before returning back to the parking lot.    One logistical item of note (and it's common to a lot of Yellowstone's developed attractions) is that this place has a lot of visitors but there will probably be a line at the smallish toilet facility. Plan your caffeine intake accordingly.    There's a photographer in West Yellowstone who sells postcards of the aerial view of this spring to shoppers. If you can't climb up to the viewpoint, go to the shop and buy a postcard. It'll brighten up any room in your house."
70,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020,not available,"Coldwater, OH ",Do the hike to view from above,"Walking the boardwalk is great, but be sure to do the shorter portion of the fairy trail to the Grand Prismatic Spring Overlook.  Seeing it from above is so much better. It’s amazing."
71,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Carlsbad, CA, ",Yellowstone HIGHLIGHT!,We loved Grand Prismatic Spring so much that we went twice! We stopped at the Fairy Falls trailhead to the GSM overlook on our first day and then stopped at GSM on day 2 after visiting the Upper Geyser Basin. The spring is so large and beautiful! It’s fascinating to walk around the boardwalk and see it and the Excelsior Geyser Crater closeup. It’s one of many Yellowstone highlights that I will always treasure. I’d love to return to see it in winter!

But, unless you have a drone or some fantastic camera equipment, you're NEVER gonna get that Nat Geo shot. (ever.) And that's okay.

83,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020,not available,"Troutville, Virginia, United States ",Must see from observation point,"Observation point is not on any maps and a little difficult to find. Go to Fairy Falls hike. The beauty of the spring is not visible from the ground when walking the boardwalk, esp. as steam blows in your face. Beautiful from up top. Not easy climb but not long and well worth it."
84,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020,not available,"Houston, TX, ",Make sure you see Grand Prismatic from Midway Geyser Basin AND the Overlook,"Grand Prismatic is the LARGEST hot spring in the US. There are 2 ways to see Grand Prismatic Spring. The easier option is by walking the board walk at Midway Geyser Basin. The second is by parking at the Fairy Falls Parking Lot and walking the 1.6 miles round trip to the Grand Prismatic Overlook. We did both on Thursday, 9/3 and I would recommend both because when you see the Grand Prismatic up close, you don't really see the colors and perspective you would at the Overlook. The Overlook hike is DEFINITELY worth your time and energy.    The key to going to the Overlook is not to visit in the morning because the steam coming from the Grand Prismatic does NOT make for good photos. Go in the afternoon after the steam burns off. Yes, it may be hot and the trail has little shade. If the Fairy Falls small lot is full, there is another overflow parking lot.    We actually visited the Overlook twice (once at around 8 am and again at 3 pm). You can see in my photos how you will not be able to get a good picture early in the morning. The 1.6 miles round trip took us around an hour to walk."
85,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Chadds Ford, PA ",A Must See,These pools were so cool! There was a bison right in the parking area which was an unexpected treat. We were there at sunset so everything was very surreal. The contrasting winds that were cold and hot was so weird but very cool.

89,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Seattle, WA ",Cool and steamy in the morning,We tried to go around 11am yesterday but parking was insane. We arrived there around 7am this morning and it was a great experience. We watched the sun rise over the hill and shared the attraction with maybe another 10 cars. The walkways were a bit damp so watch your step. The vents were very steamy so we couldn't see the same colors you see in photos but still worth the visit.
90,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2020,not available,"Seattle, WA ",Sunny is WAY more beautiful than cloudy,"The outlook is no longer a secret. It was crowded around 10am in Mid-Aug. The pool was still steamy and it was a cloudy morning. We continued hiking to Fairy Falls and then on our way back went up to the outlook as it was sunnier and hot, around noon. You can see the difference in my photos!    So the best time is on a sunny day with clear skies and warm temperatures. Of course, that is when others are there as well. It was crowded with no social distances and no masks. So keep that risk in mind.    ps. Fairy Falls can be skipped. It's fine to stretch your legs but it was busy and the trail was boring. To be fair, I'm spoiled by lots of more beautiful falls in PNW though. Instead, Grand Teton's hidden falls are prettier."
91,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2020 , Couples,"Pittsburg, CA ",The intense colors are too beautiful. Have to go!,Remember to only go if the air temperature is at least high 60s and sunny. Lower temperature the steam will pretty much cover the colors. When air temperature is higher than 72 there won’t be any steam. The walk up to the overlook is 15 mins for me. I walked pretty fast and the uphill is minimal.

The trail is soft pack and has a elevation gain of 135 feet maxing at 7,077 above sea level. I know most people say it’s a easy hike but I’m a big guy and after walking/hiking all around Yellowstone all day it can cause a sweat. Bring water.    Also, it’s a mad house for the spring parking and fairy falls between noon and 6pm in peak season. I’ve read that it is covered with steam in the mornings and that you should view it on a clear day with the temp over 70 degrees for the best color. Definitely a sight to see. Enjoy."

95,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2020,not available,"York, ME, ",Gem of Yellowstone!,We saw it a couple of different ways. By parking near the Grand Prismatic Spring there are boardwalks up close to it. To fully appreciate it park over by the trailhead to Fairy Falls and there is a short hike up to a stunning viewpoint. That is the most common picture of it that you see.
96,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2020,not available,"Denver, CO ",Breathtaking,So beyond gorgeous! Be sure to park a mile down the road and take another route up the back side and you can get even better views of it rather than the main parking lot.    The colors are so vibrant and breathtaking!

We decided to view it from the overlook that is accessed from the road into the Fairy Falls trail. We arrived early, probably around 8:00am, and there was still a lot of steam coming off the spring, so we decided to hike to Fairy Falls first. We made our way back to Grand Prismatic around 10:15. There was still a small amount of steam but the coloring was stunning. It is a bit of an incline to get to the overlook, but totally worth it. It was just starting to get crowded as we were leaving"
100,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2019,not available,"Henderson, KY ",Amazing thing to see - probably better to see in the summer.,"Obviously an amazing thing to see! HOWEVER, we went in early October, and it was so cold, the hot springs created a LARGE amount of steam, so we had to work hard to see everything. It was majestic, it was awe inspiring, etc. Would definitely do again. Though October is late in the season, it was also not crowded at all!! So that was nice."

102,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2020,not available,"Los Altos, CA ",A Surreal Experience,"A trip to Yellowstone cannot be completely without a visit to the Grand Prismatic Spring. A short .5 mile boardwalk surrounds the spring and other pools. It can be quite busy, but I recommend going when the light is still up to get the full experience of colors. The brilliance of the multitude of colors is absolutely incredible and unearthly. There is a larger pool near it that boasts a brilliant blue and then there are two smaller pools with extravagant colors. I recommend finding parking in the parking lot for it is closest, but you may also park on the side of the road if needed. This walk is wheelchair and handicap accessible and is very very easy."
103,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2020 , Friends,"Chicago, IL ",Nature's wonder,"Breathtaking place in Yellowstone National Park. Place where nature amazes your mind with rainbow colors and sizes of the springs.  This place like a magnet that attracts people's crowd. It is one of the nature's wonder, a must see place on earth.  If you want to see it close and personal be prepared to wait a quiet long line , especially in a high season, July, August.  People are taking a lot of photos of this spring and this is the reason for long line.  The only downside (Imho) you see it very close and at the same level / plane so you can't embrace the whole thing from a close distance.  The one tip that I received from a park ranger is to approach it from a bit different direction.  She recommended to park at Fairy Falls trail parking and take a short walk, hike to an elevated viewing deck from which you can see the whole Grand Prismatic Spring. At that viewing point you can absorb the size of this wonder.  In any case, I would recommend to view it from above and close and personal.  Also, remember that parking near Grand Prismatic spring is very limited and if you want to park there you need to come early but if parking if full then you can park along the road. There are plenty of space.  Enjoy the views !!"

110,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2020,not available,"Orlando, FL ",Take the Hike to the Overlook,"Fortunately a national park ranger told us about the Fairy Falls Trail that provides an incredible, worth-it view of Grand Prismatic Spring from the trail's overlook. We could see people below walking up to the spring on the boardwalk trail, but to have the view from above was truly Grand! The Spring is gorgeous, colorful, crystal, worth remembering. There is parking at the Fairy Falls Trailhead. You'll walk a paved path and will be on the same path at that point as others who may be going on to the lower level boardwalk. Perhaps at .2 or .3 miles you'll see a dirt path that heads to your left. That's the trail to the overlook. The elevation is not daunting by any means. At the overlook there's a nice wood platform with plenty of room for viewing. If in the Yellowstone NP in the future, we would definitely do this trail again. On our walk back to the parking lot, we were rewarded with seeing several bison in back of the parking area that we stood and watched for a while.."
111,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020 , Family,"Pulaski, TN ",Beautiful and Amazing,"This is a spot to see. Parking can be a problem. I do wish we we did the Fairy Falls to get the full view. Don't get me wrong up close is amazing, the pictures I see are amazing from the overlook. If I could do it again I would would do the Fairy Falls instead."
112,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020 , Family,"East Brunswick, NJ ",Unbelievable!,We got to admire it from the Fairy fall trail and the observation area. Very difficult to wrap your mind around it. What an amazing sight!!! The Old Faithful got nothing on this!
113,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020 , Family,"Highland, UT ",My Eyes Couldn’t Believe It! Amazing!,If you are going to Yellowstone then you must see the Grand Prismatic! My eyes could barely believe it. I suggest doing it both ways. We first went to the boardwalk. We saw the Excelsior Geyser as well on the boardwalk. With the line on the boardwalk we took about 45 minutes. I wanted to see the aerial view so we went again— this time with the hike. You go past the boardwalk and park near the signs for fairy falls. I timed it for you. It is .78 hike up to the lookout. It took us 17 minutes to get up to the top and 15 minutes to get down. So overall it is faster to see the aerial view and very beautiful. However you cannot see the Excelsior Geyser. But if you can only do one...take the aerial trail.
114,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020,not available,"West Fargo, ND ",Take the trail from Fairy Falls parking,Best to see this from the overlook! Go to the Fairy Falls parking lot and hike about 0.6 miles (parking lot is just south of Pristmatic Springs parking lot which is always busy). The view of the spring is gorgeous from above. See the spring up close if your okay with waiting forever for parking.
115,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020,not available, ,Worth the Wait,"Even though we were on ground level with the spring and the steam was blowing our way, I still thoroughly enjoyed Grand Prismatic Spring. It would be best to have both the view from the ground AND find the overlook, but we didn't have time for both. The parking lot was very crowded and we had to wait for a spot to open up, but I guess I am a sucker for geothermal features such as this one because to me, it was worth the wait. Just don't know where in the country you can see something of this magnitude! I highly recommend it and it's nice because you get to see some other features on the way to the Grand Prismatic Spring."
116,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020,not available,"Naperville, IL ",So stunning!,We did the hike up the hill to view the springs from atop and then also completed the hike at eye-level. Both were stunning views and well worth the effort!

As you see the hot spring at ground level you pass the Excelsior, a dormant geyser, but very lovely big, and bubbly-hot. Apparently it has spurted steam 300 feet, but is not predictable."
121,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020 , Couples,"Meridian, ID, ",Brilliant colors,"One of the 1st places you'll stop as you make the loop around Yellowstone and absolutely can't be missed. Between the amazing colors and the steam rising off the top of the water, it's great for photo Ops if you can get there before the crowds do. Make sure you get a picture standing on top up the benches throughout the walkway so you can see the full spectrum of colors in the water."
122,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2020,not available,"Watsonville, CA ",best to see when it is warm,Do not go there when it is very cold because all you see is steam.

We loved all  of the colors and characteristics of the landscape and the soil. It took us a while to get a parking space at our first visit. So second visit we parked along the road and walked over ( recommended). It was warm around the Spring and very “steamy” feeling. We also went to the overlook ( like 1 mile driving distance) on the way to Fairy Fall trail and the GP Spring view was better. We saw a leach and a very skinny snake in the pond ( the one with the broken cable hanging).  Tip: we saw tons of bisons when drove from Yellowstone West to GP Spring. What a scene when they crossed the street!

However, there was a long line to get into the parking lot area, which requires patience. We waited about 15 minutes for a parking space on a non crowded day, so it wasn’t too bad. If you only have one day with limited time & the line is really big, you might skip this one. The view from the boardwalk is not the same as the many photos of a giant colorful pool. You really can only see it from a side view, which is still great but similar to some of the other beautiful pools in the area. You mostly see the bright yellow & brown colors with the blue off in the distance under lots of steam. If you want to see the pool from the top view, you need to walk up hill about a mile to the viewing point. I did not have the time or the energy to make the hike, but it was still very enjoyable from where we saw it. The waterfalls flowing from the pools into the river at the entryway & the other smaller springs in the area were all extremely beautiful & colorful. There is a short walk required to view the spring, but not too strenuous. We were there for about 40 minutes in order to see everything & take lots of photos."

There are many others throughout the park and they even offer a small theater presentation about hot springs and geysers if you want to learn more. If you visit and want to see an aerial view you should stop by the nearby parking lot which has a trail that takes you to see the spring from above via the Fairy Falls trail. This gives you some better perspective of the entire spring and the surrounding areas.

Excelsior Geyser is so blue and jaw droppingly large but Grand Prismatic, the largest hot spring, is the real crowd pleaser. The center is a deep blue shading to blue green and yellow at the edges. The runoff channels are picture perfect--yellow, orange. The colors are caused by the heat loving organisms like bacteria and algae and the color is determined by the temperature of the water. I have only seen this feature from the boardwalk but there is a hill that can be climbed by more adventurous people than I am for a view from above which I can only imagine is stunning. I never tire of this basin no matter how many times I visit. Please refrain from graffiting in the bacteria mats accessible from the boardwalk--just take a photo so others can enjoy."
147,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019,not available,Ohio ,One of my favorites!!!,"Located between Old Faithful and Madison is an .8 mile boardwalk takes you up close and personal to the Grand Prismatic Spring and other geyser attractions!    Fairy Falls Trail, a 1 mile hike to an incredible overlook of the Grand Prismatic Spring, best view!!! If you’re headed from Old Faithful back towards Madison, it is about mid-way on the left. Parking for the main attraction to hike the boardwalk it pretty easy to find. If you want to hike the trail to the overlook, parking for that can be a little more difficult to find. It is also no the left about a mile before the main viewing area. Don't forget the bear spray just in case!"

However, note that when the weather is cold, you can hardly see the spring pool for the steaming riding off it with such a vast difference in temperature between the water an the air above it. First time we approached it, from the boardwalk, w hardly so the pring, it was like being inside an over enthusiastic Turkish bath. Two days later, when it was warmer, we took the hike to the upper viewpoint - and this, as it turned out, is an absolute must: now we were looking down on the - clear! - spring and it was just simply breathtaking."

You definelty want to plan depending on season and weather. We went early in the morning and there were very few people. The issue was that since it was just above freezing in the high 30's low 40's there was a lot of steam coming off the spring. As a result it was really only available to view close up. You definetly want to check the weather and the conditions when coming you might have to deal with crowds if you want to get the perfect shot.

155,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2019,not available,"Omaha, NE ",Many faces—must do!,"We enjoyed the benefit of visiting the Grand Prismatic Spring on two separate days, each with different weather conditions. Both visits were amazing. On one visit, the air was cold, and a fog settled over the site, giving us an otherworldly perspective. On the other day, the temperature was warmer and the day clear, giving us a broad perspective. The walkway around the area is easy (TIP: heed the signs, stay on the walkway, and don’t reach into and destroy the algae). The colors/sights range from the stark to the startling. This attraction gets crowded (even in the late-season when we visited), so either arrive early or just plan to be patient in parking and with the other visitors on the walkway (TIP: Put this as an early stop on the day’s itinerary). I’d rate this as one of the must-do stops on a Yellowstone trip. Highly recommended."

We have climbed the hill to the south in the past to get the eagle eye view of the spring but there is a new path to make the climb easier. Unfortunately, we couldn't climb the path last weekend because a bear was eating a carcass on the path. The whole Fairy Falls parking lot and trail was closed all three days we were in the park. Disappointing but understandable - we did not want to encounter a ravenous bear!    On our recent trip we walked the boardwalks, reveling in the colors, the steam, the mist on our faces. It was wintry and cold - perfect to see the steam coming off the spring.    Most people were respectful of staying off the algae mats and other crusts but one lady lost her hat and she walked out to retrieve it. Leave your hat there! Or better yet - don't wear a hat! It's windy there and hats that aren't secure can be victims of a big gust."

161,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available,"Cornelius, NC ",Beautiful but plan your trip accordingly,"The GPS is really something to see but you'll need to plan your visit to get the most out of it. Since we were in Yellowstone during the busy summer time, we went to the overlook early one morning to avoid the crowds. However, due to the cooler morning temperature and the heat from the spring water, there was quite a lot of steam coming off the spring which made it difficult to see (but we were still able to get a pretty decent pic of it). After a hike to Fairy Falls, we decided to go back to the overlook to see if the steam had dissipated only to turn around because it was packed with people.  So, here's what we learned: If you're visiting in the summer, go fairly early in the morning to avoid the crowds on the overlook, as it's quite small and doesn't hold a lot of people. However, be prepared for the view to be somewhat obscured by steam. We didn't get a chance to go back in the evening, but it may be a better option for optimal viewing.  And, while there is also the boardwalk that goes around the GPS and allows you to be up close and personal, the best view is from the overlook.    Note: The hike up to the overlook is a pretty consistent incline so if you - or someone in your party - has physical issues, you'll need to go slow or skip the overlook altogether."
162,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2019,not available,"Clarksville, TN ",Best View is from the Overlook,"It's nice to hike around the Grand Prismatic Hot Springs. On the boardwalk you are immersed in the steam and smells of sulfur. But the best view of the hot spring is at the Overlook. Park at the Fairy Falls trailhead, just south of the main parking lot. There is a bridge over the river. The hike is relatively flat for the first two thirds of the hike. Then turn left up the hill to the overlook. If the elevation is bothering you, just take the hill slowly. At the top you will find a great viewing spot to see the Grand Prismatic. We went first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds. Unfortunately, the weather was rather cool, and as the fog lifted, there was still too much steam coming off the hotspring. Disappointed, we decided to come back in the early evening. Again, we missed the colors of the hot spring as the sun had just gone below the mountains. The third time was the charm for us! The next day we went mid morning on a sunny day. There was a lone bison on the trail that we had to wait on to move off, but the view was spectacular! We saw some very nice colors on the hot spring and you could tell how it got it's name. For someone who hates to hike up hills, and was having difficulty with the elevation, I walked up that hill three times in two days to get the best view. It is totally worth it!"

170,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2019,not available,"Sydney, Australia ",Amazing colours,"Wow just wow. So beautiful. We started off by walking on the boardwalks on the ground up to the spring (not much parking so had to park along the road) and the view from the boardwalk is pretty seeing the colours up close. However like other reviewers have said, it is 100% better seeing it from above at the overlook. The trail for the overlook starts at the Fairy Falls Trail parking lot up the road and once you walk over the bridge and along the dirt track, there is a sign saying to walk left up the trail. A moderate hike for a fit person but depending on what time of day you start, it does get pretty hot (we were there in early September). At the top is a viewing platform and the view overlooking the Grand Prismatic Spring is just gorgeous. You realise how high you are with how small the people look walking on the boardwalk below next to the spring. Well worth the effort of hiking but you'll need sneakers, a hat and definately water. Best time for viewing either at the lookout or down on the boardwalk is not in the morning. That's when all the heavy steam is blocking the view. Unfortunately the best time of the day is in the middle of the day when it's the hottest but you'll have the best views and the best pictures. Time taken to slowly walk to the overlook and back with 15 mins up top took a few hours. Must do in Yellowstone."

The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park is the largest hot spring in the United States, and the third largest in the world.    The best and only way to experience Grand Prismatic’s true appeal, in my opinion, is seeing it from the overlook! The overlook is not marked! You can find the parking lot for this trail near the Fairy Falls Trailhead at Midway Geyser Basin. The hike will take you close to an hour round trip at a moderate pace… but it was absolutely worth the effort.    After you park, head for the trail which begins as you cross an old bridge. You will want to wear sturdy shoes and take some water as the hike includes a 105 foot climb up the hill over about half a mile. As you start the ascent, you will start to see Grand Prismatic Spring beyond the trees. The trees begin to give way the farther up the hill you go. At the end of the trail the trees give way to a clearing and a viewing platform. Head out onto this platform for easily one of the very best views of Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone.    This stunning view is one of the best views you can get to on foot. It gives you a view of the entire spring. The best days to attend are a warm day (to avoid the steam off of the spring) and a clear day so you can see the brilliant colors against a beautiful blue sky."

There are 2 ways to view it. One is from the boardwalk trail but you don't get a very good view of it this way, you are almost at eye level with it. The other and better way is to park at the Fairy Falls Trailhead and walk about 3/4 mile to an observation point. From the point you are treated to amazing views of Grand Prismatic Spring. Weather and sunlight may affect how colorful the spring is. When we visited in June on an overcast day, the colors weren't as brilliant. No matter which way you visit (boardwalk or observation point) be prepared for large crowds, some of them inconsiderate enough to almost push you off the boardwalk. Visiting early or late in the day is the best time to avoid the majority of the crowds."

Find the Fairy Falls trailhead about five miles northwest of Old Faithful. After an easy 1.5 mile hike, you'll reach an overlook that enables you to see the glorious, multi-colored spring from an elevated position.

The iconic pictures of Grand Prismatic Spring have been imbedded in my mind since I was a child having seen this rainbow-like pool in countless magazines and films. Once I crossed the bridge over the river I entered into a steam shrouded world. Sounds of hissing steam, running water and bubbling pools surrounded me. An extensive boardwalk system took me adjacent to and over the springs. Grand Prismatic is the largest and most elaborate. The blowing steam, periodically changing directions cast a curtain-like hide-and-seek with the spring. Signage is informative. Of note, parking is in short supply here as the lot is small. Many people park along the side of the road and walk into the area."

Colours were magic and the water was crystal...highly recommend"
214,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2019,not available,"Johnston, IA ",1.5 Mile Hike to Overlook,"The only way to properly see the colors of the Grand Prismatic Spring is from the overlook. This parking lot is just south of the boardwalk parking. It is crowded also but does seem to be less busy than the boardwalk. Hiking to the overlook requires about a mile to 1.5 mile hike to the overlook area depending on parking. The hike is fairly flat for about the first 3/4 of the hike and then rises rapidly at the end. The walk way is loose gravel/sand, so must have hiking shoes or sneakers. A walking stick would help older hikers. I was able to do this hike with my 7 and 10 year old children. The views were amazing."

It was a bit foggy in the morning but on the way back it was incredibly clear. You can't go wrong and it was a great hike, we went to the waterfall and further along was a geyser (Imperial?) and mudpots."

217,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available, ,Beautiful - but take the time to hike the mountain to see it!,"We loved this and were so glad many people told us to take the hike up the mountain for that's when you can see it best. If you are at the same level as the Grand Prismatic Spring, you don't see it as great. However, be warned. The hike is a rocky trail, not too bad, but steep and we hiked it on a very hot day without water, sun block or hat, which wasn't the smartest thing to do. We thought it didn't look like a long hike, but was unfortunately, mistaken. If you have children, this may not be the best place to bring them for we saw the majority of children complaining about the walk. Overall, this is a must see!"

219,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available,"Las Vegas, NV ",Beautiful colors,Getting in to the parking lot was an experience and we waited about 15 minutes to get a parking spot. It was well worth it for the beautiful colors associated with the spring.
220,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2019 , Family,"Kaysville, UT ",Packed attraction,The parking lot is small and packed but is a definite must on every visit to Yellowstone. The boardwalk will take you to see some of mother nature's greatest handiwork.    The Grand prismatic springs are worth the stop. Some stairs involved and may be difficult for strollers or wheel chairs.
221,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available, ,Superb display of Hydro-Thermal Beauty!,"GRAND PRISMATIC SPRING  At 7270ft altitude, the Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming is the largest hot spring in the United States and the third largest in the world. About 110m in diameter and a 50m in depth, the Spring discharges approximately 2100 liters of hot water (at 70 Degrees Celsius) per minute.    Located in the Midway Geyser Basin, it is famous for its striking coloration matching most of those seen in the rainbow.    This coloration is the outcome of microbial activity in the lake water developing a microbial mat at the rim of the mineral rich water. You will find a stark change of color from green to orange to red depending on the ratio of chlorophyll to carotenoids in the mat as well as the temperature gradient.    The deep blue color of the water in the center of the pool results from the intrinsic blue color of water. The effect is strongest in the center of the spring, because of its sterility and depth."
222,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Magnolia, TX ",Grand Prismatic Spring,Just beautiful! Park at Fairy Falls & hike to the observation area for better views of the spring. The incline is a little steep on the last part of the hike but the view is so much better than walking from the GPS parking lot. It is worth the short hike! Parking is better at Fairy Falls also! The first picture is ground level with the spring. The second picture is from the FF observation area.

225,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available,"Tonawanda, NY ",Don't leave the park without seeing,Perhaps the most stunning feature in the park. The colors are just as you see them. Located in the Mid Geyser basin area the best way to view is from the mountainside taking a short hike from Ferry Falls. You wont see much of it from the boardwalk below but there are other features you won't want to miss
226,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Family,"Newton, MA ",Looks like it does in the pictures!,I wasn’t sure how vivid the colours of the spring would look as it appears in all the Yellowstone literature - but it does look amazing! The colours are bright and stunning - just like the pictures!!
227,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available,Florida ,What a nice assortment of nature!,I enjoyed looking at the tall geyser and the colorful springs. Boardwalks were how one traversed this area. There was a scarcity of parking.
228,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019,not available,"Charlottesville, VA ",Wow!,Grand prismatic is one of the prettiest pool hot springs in the world. Never disappointing. Extremely hard to get a good photo. Excellent boardwalk trails all around the area.
229,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Family,"Chantilly, VA ",Astounding colors in nature’s own lab,"Of all the attractions in YNP, Grand Prismatic Spring located in Midway Basin has a special mystique with so many bright colors, vapors rising from the pool and the bottom of the pool exhibiting ever changing contours of clay and other materials. It is a rare treat that can only be expected here. The boardwalk is moderately inclined, posing little challenge for people with issues. Parking is limited and one may need to wait a while to get a spot. Nature’s laboratory can be one of the seven wonders."
230,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Vancouver, Canada ",Very beautiful,This is the most beautiful place in Yellowstone park amongst all the major view points I went. To see the spring clearly I recommend to go through the fairy falls trail to a view point in the middle of a mountain.
231,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Best, The Netherlands, ",Magnificent!!,"One of the most beautiful areas in Yellowstone National Park! If you can, go to the overlook where my photo’s are taken from. This gives you a far better view of the Grand Prismatic Spring."
232,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019,not available,"Brentwood, UK ",Weather spoilt it!,I bet this is a really great place but our trip in mid May meant we could barely see anything. We did get a great moment when the morning sun broke through and the whole place looked like something out of the Lord of the Rings - the Mordor bit. Time your visit - but really atmospheric.
233,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Couples,"San Francisco, CA ",Impressive spring - Must See,"The iconic Grand Prismatic Spring is a must do activity when in the park. Yes, depending on conditions there can be considerable steam and haze, but give it a try. Most take the boardwalk to view the spring, but you’re likely to get the best view from the overlook on the hike to Fairy Falls. It’s not a long hike and there is obviously a vertical rise, perhaps 100 feet or so. It is the best vantage point from which to view the spring. Park in the Fairy Falls parking lot and take off from there. Early or late in the day will avoid the crowds, if that is to your liking."
234,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available, ,The colors are amazing,"When we visited 3 days ago, the day was such that the colors were quite vibrant It was truly worth the hike/walk to see this phenomenon."
235,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019,not available,"Chicago, IL ",Must see BUT prepare for haze,"Certainly a must see in Yellowstone, the anticipation to see it should be tempered by the realization that there is a very high probability that it will only be partially visible. The feature creates its own steam spinning right off the face of the water, which tends to make getting a mist-free view almost an impossibility at many times. That said, what can be seen is pretty and gives you a sense of how beautiful the feature can be if seen fully. To better appreciate the view, do climb to the overlook as the boardwalk view does not provide a good perspective on the entirety of this large thermal feature."
236,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Family,"Spirit Lake, IA ",Number One thing you must do!,This is by far the number one thing to do in Yellowstone. It’s beautiful but make sure it’s a warmer day! We visited it after a small rain storm and the air temperature had dropped so drastically that all you day was steam not all the beautiful colors.
237,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available,"West Chester, PA ",Wow - Worth Visiting,We viewed this amazing site from the ground and then took the hike up to Fairy falls to see the view from above. Would recommend doing both. Great site for pictures. Easy hike up as well

239,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Family,"The Hague, The Netherlands ",Amazing,It is probably the best spot in Yellowstone. The best view is from the overlook but also from the boardwalks it is amazing. It is very busy and it is very complicated to find a parking spot. But it deserves patience and time to park the car.
240,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available,"Huntingdon, UK, ",Go to the Fairy Falls viewpoint,The Pool is best seen from the viewpoint on the way to Fairy Falls. It’s reasonably steep but doable even if you have poor walking ability. The view is awesome though can easily be obscured by steam from the pool on cold days.
241,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Family,"Nanuet, NY ",Worth watching!,"It is amazing and a must watch when you are at Yellowstone.it is so colorful and beautiful that when you see it,just forget other things!It is a real wonder of the nature!You need at least one to one and half hour to enjoy it."

If there is one place not to miss, this is Grand Prismatic spring, not doubt at all!  Always better when the weather is sunny and the sky is blue.  Always better early in the morning or late in the afternoon to enjoy the fantastic shades of colors and to avoid the huge crowd of people!  Good tip for you: avoid the always crowded parking and find a place to park before or after the parking, you will earn a lot of time, believe me!"
245,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Family,"Minot, ND, ",Uniquely Captivating Springs,The Grand Prismatic Springs is another of Yellowstone National Parks’s must see sites. It is very close tote road so crowds are constant but it is still amazing. It is a mild walk but worth it.
246,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019,not available,"Wentzville, MO ",Gorgeous colors!,"This is the most colorful and beautiful spring in the park. It is definitely worth walking along the boardwalk and experiencing the warm humid air and steam that comes off the spring. And the lovely smell...LOL. But also a must is driving a bit further up the road to the Fairy Falls Trail head and walking to the Grand Prismatic Spring Overlook, you really get a view of the colors. The hike isn't all that hard, but it is up hill to the overlook, I believe it is approx. one mile to the overlook."
247,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available,"Aiken, SC ",This was worth finding.,Parking is limited. There's a path along the river that leads to the bridge across to the boardwalk. There are 4 springs there. They were all pretty.

250,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Couples,"San Antonio, TX ",Take the Fairy Falls Hike,"This can be seen from the shorter boardwalk hike, but it was very steamy both in the morning and late afternoon, so it was hard (impossible) to see the colorful water.  Suck it up and take the much longer trail to the scenic overlook. It’s so worth it!"
251,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available, ,Beautiful and worth the stop,"This is a beautiful geyser and easy walk around to see it. The most challenging park is parking which is limited. If you want to experience the geyser from above, drive a short distance to the Fairy Falls parking and it is a 20 minute easy walk to see the geyser from a different perspective. I would recommend both ground level and the overlook."
252,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Elk Point, Canada ",Gorgeous But a Little Hair Raising,"Definitely one of my 3 “must see” sites in Yellowstone (the other two being Old Faithful and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone).    The scenery around is gorgeous and dipping your feet in the river just outside is so refreshing.    It’s a scene like none other. Huge colourful holes of boiling mineral water that defy description, and gorgeous many-hued streams of water running in every direction.    The beauty also leads to the hazard however. It’s a raised walkway through a death trap. If you have small children you will want an iron grip, good buckles on strollers, and maybe a leash or seven. There is often only a small two inch wooden lip between the edge of the walkway and priceless geological history that also could prove exceptionally hazardous.    Also watch the wind, as it can blow clouds of steam your way, or blow your unprotected headgear out of reach forever."
253,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019,not available, ,Spectacular,One of the most amazing sites of Yellowstone (in my opinion). There are two ways to see this place. The main visitor site is extremely crowded and busy in July. People parked for up to two miles on the highway and walked back to the entrance.
254,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Brockton, MA ",Another Spring,"Not sure how I feel about this spring. The boardwalk is level with the spring and the steam hides quite a bit of the colors. Whether it was the time of day or realizing there was a trail above, but this was not one of my favorites to see."
255,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Family,"Boone, NC ",Totally Awesome 👏,This was an attraction we had at the top of our list to see in Yellowstone. We got to the parking location for it and the only place we found was almost a mile from it along the roadside. Research the best times of day for this one for sure...
256,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019,not available,"Winnipeg, Canada ",Rainbow on Earth,It was about one hour drive from North entrance to the geyser. Expect delays since road is under construction. Two options are available. Take a boardwalk tour around geyser or take a trail and watch it from above. We did both and do not regret.
257,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Burnsville, MN ",View from Fairy Falls Trail,Short easy 1 mile walk (one way) to overlook except for last part which is a switchback climb. The switchback trail is pretty good condition but may be difficult for physically limited or older seniors. TIP: if cloudy or soon dusk pick another day/time as need the sun for the full color affect. We arrived with storm clouds coming over & colors just were not brilliant. Also if rain clouds approaching take rain jacket as long walk back when it is raining & hailing-trust me on that! Fortunately we take our rain gear!
258,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019,not available,"Flower Mound, TX ",Amazing!,"We went with a three year old and a thirteen year old. Obviously with the toddler we couldn’t go up to the overlook, but the view was great from below too. The boardwalk was easy to navigate and you could see some but not all of the color from it. Hold on to your hats though, because we saw many hats fallen in the springs!"
259,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2019 , Family,"Fort Worth, TX ",Go to the overlook,"We went to the overlook first (via the Fairy Falls trail). The colors are so impressive, and it's neat to see it from above. We then went down to the boardwalk, and it was pretty disappointing. There was a lot of steam, which made it difficult to see the colors on the interior."
260,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,Norway ,Just amazing!,"For me, Grand Prismatic Spring was one of the highlights. It was cool to see it at a close range, but even cooler from above. If you’re going there, don’t miss the overlook trail. It’s worth the walk, and it’s not that far from the parking lot. Highly recommended for everyone."
261,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Richardson, TX ",Hike the Overlook to Get the Best View,"From the boardwalk, it is hard to get the perspective of how big the spring is. Also, depending on the weather, steam can make it tough to capture the colors. Avoid these issues by taking the hike to the overlook, which is a part of the Fairy Falls trail area. You get a more bird's eye view of the spring, although the hike itself isn't all that scenic."
262,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Mold, UK ",Amazing,This is an absolute must if you visit Yellowstone.    It does get busy and we had to park some distance way and walk which was no problem to us but might have proved difficult for the elderly or infirm.    The walkways are great but it does get windy so if you are wearing a sun hat beware. We saw so many hats that had blown off heads and were out of reach from the walkway.    Just an amazing experience and the information boards are very helpful too.
263,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Miami, FL ",Amazing,We did the hike to the overlook. The parking was full but we were lucky and only had to wait 5 minutes for someone to come out. The hike is fairly boring alongside a long stretch of road overlooking the basin without any cover. Near the end you come to a fairly steep climb to get to the overlook.  Its definatley worth it to go to the end .
264,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Solo,"Liverpool, UK, ",Grand,Get there early to beat the crowds. Large area of geysers with the Grand Prismatic Spring as the star of the show.
265,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Klein, TX ",Excelsior Geyser Crater,"Excelsior Geyser Crater is alive, bubbling, steaming, and gorgeously glacial blue. It is in the same field as the Grand Prismatic Spring - you will pass it on the boardwalk. Go to this site! You will walk past several colorful pools and actively boiling, bubbling features. (I enjoyed our time here far more than seeing Old Faithful erupt.)"
266,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,SD ,So. Beautiful!,"We LOVED it and it was the biggest highlight for me personally in the park. However, we went around 1pm and it was 85 degrees and the sulfer mist was sauna like on top of that. And lots of people! So if you have small children, maybe consider going in the morning before old faithful bc they were getting warm. Also, my one regret was not hiking the Fairy Falls Trailhead to get the bird's eye view of the spring. It was so gorgeous but I can imagine being up and looking down would have been more epic. This is an absolute must see though in the park!"
267,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Draper, UT, ",Overlook,Parking at noonish was a little tricky. We parked on the road. The “hike “ has a bit of an uphill to it. Not difficult.
268,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"San Jose, CA ",A must-visit place; set aside at least a half-day,There are some places at YNP that are must-see. This is one of those. The mere beauty of this colorful natural phenomenon would leave you with lasting memories.    Do visit both the overlook as well as the boardwalk. They both offer different views.
269,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Elyria, OH ",Very crowded,We were glad no one was pushed off the boardwalk as it was elbow to elbow especially at the spring itself. The fairy falls walk that gives you a birds eye view looked crowded too. Worth a visit but try to pick a non peak time
270,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Bloomington, IN ",One of the highlights of the trip,"Definitely worth a stop. In fact, this was my second visit to Yellowstone after a trip here when I was 7 years old, more than 50 years ago. I had maybe three or four recollections overall of YNP, and Grand Prismatic Springs was one of them. So very memorable. One of the nice features of this stop is the variety, as it includes hot springs, active geysers, mud pots, and other features. Helpful hint: HOLD YOUR KIDDIES' HANDS, and also hold onto your loose clothing. This is the only place within YNP where I saw litter, mostly sunglasses and hats that had fallen off peoples' heads off the boardwalk where they could not be retrieved. Also, don't be that idiot who throws a coin in the springs like it's a wishing well. It's not and you're littering."
271,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Rochester, MN ",A must see!,"IF you don’t have any plans while in Yellowstone you MUST put this spot on your list!!! It’s like nothing you will ever see in your life! The colors are amazing and so beautiful! Take the 3 mile hike to the overlook, it’s breathtaking. Although I’d you prefer you can walk the boardwalk around it, it’s just not as grand."

274,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Laveno-Mombello, Italy ",Overlook point not to be missed,"Whilst the visit of the Grand Prismatic Spring from the boardwalk is amazing, there is an overlook point halfway up the hill which gives an even better perspective. This can be accessed from the next parking lot driving on from the Grand Prismatic Spring in the direction of Old Faithful, though a trail which is easy but unmarked."
275,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Minden, IA ",SO cool.,What a different viewing experience. The colors of the steam and the beautiful colors of the spring are something you won't regret taking the time to see. The walk around the board walk is easy and gives outstanding vantage points to view the spring. Parking can be tough so get there early.
276,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Peoria, IL, ",Amazing! See it from above at Fairy Falls Trail,"Grand Prismatic Spring is what first made me want to visit Yellowstone--that iconic surreal blue and orange pool seen from above. We decided to see it from the overlook that can be reached from the Fairy Falls trailhead. Just drive about 5 minutes north from Old Faithful and you will come to it. Even mid-afternoon on a Monday, we found parking in the lot. If not, there is street parking.    For the best views and to not get the view steamed in, I'd recommend a sunny, warm day, probably in the afternoon. We arrived around 2:30 PM. The walk up is pretty short--it does get a bit steep the last 0.2 miles or so. If you use trekking poles, I'd bring them. But the view from the overlook is breathtaking! It's indescribable. We spent about 10 min up there, just taking it in. If you want that iconic overhead shot, you'll need to hike up to it and not just see it from ground level. One of the best things I did in Yellowstone!"
277,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,Germany ,Out of this world,Best spot for amazing pictures in Yellowstone! You should come here after 10 am and before 5pm to have the best light. I can although recommend the walk to the the spring from above!
278,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019,not available,California ,Array of colors,This is a popular stop so best done early in the day if not will have to park on road and walk in. Walk up on ramps is nice and you and go at your own pace. At a point it become one way traffic which is nice.

It’s the largest hot spring of 300 feet diameter deep blue water spring of 160 degrees Fahrenheit ,steam emanating from it,outside spring colored brown, yellow, golden colour. One can hv closer look from the surrounding board walk nicely built and maintained. But best view of grand prismatic is from the Overlook Point(which is mile away from the basin ), it is really a ‘Grand’ . Worth visiting/seeing/experiencing . Marvellous 👌👍👏👏"
283,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Beautiful,The views are stunning. The trail is easy walking but slick. Can feel the hot steam from the springs. We got there close to sunset so Absoluetly gorgeous
284,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"San Rafael, CA ",Unbelievably scenic,"This geothermal feature just blew me away. Not to be missed. TIP: there are two ways to see this accessed from two different parking lots. The midway basin has a gravel / dirt trail that lets to turn off to an overlook trail where you can see the prismatic from a distance and from elevation. Another parking lot down the road let’s you access the boardwalk to see the feature close up . You definitely want to do the boardwalk trip first , and if you have time then do the overlook. The boardwalk stroll takes about a half hour with picture taking. If you are a photo buff you should use a circular polarizer filter."
285,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",Colors are Wonderful,"We saw the Grand Prismatic Spring from above at the overlook. You can see the whole spring from up there. There was a lot of steam, which hides parts of the colors. It was still amazing to see.    There was a buffalo at the bottom of the trail too."
286,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Brisbane, Australia ",Awe inspiring!,I’ve never seen anything like it anywhere else in the world. Park at the Fairy Falls car park and walk to the overlook. You can continue to Fairy Falls which I highly recommend.
287,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Fenton, MI ",Beautiful colors,"The Midway Geyser Basin offers views of a few amazing sites. The most popular is Grand Prismatic, the third largest got spring in the world (the largest in North America). There is a 5 mile hike from a nearby parking spot that is said to offer the best view from above. If you're not up for the hike the spring is still amazing to see from the board walk. There are other spring of course to see here including one that pours hundreds of gallons of hot water into the nearby river every minute."
288,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,"Moe, Australia ",Natural Beauty at its best,"The Grand Prismatic Spring in the Midway Basin with its amazing colours, as I have mentioned with other reviews these areas remind me of Rotorua in New Zealand."
289,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Sebastopol, CA, ",Best VIEW from Fairy Falls overlook!!!,"Go early! If you're coming from Old Faithful the Fairy Falls parking is before the parking lot for Grand Prismatic. The lot fills up early. Once parked, cross the wooden bridge and it's a .80 mile hike up a slight hill to the wooden deck overlook.  A lot of weather factors come into play on the type of view you'll get. You may or may not have steam coming up off the water. Whatever the conditions the views and colors are unreal. I would still go and walk the board around the spring but you'll be glad you went to the overlook too."
290,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family, ,wow spectacular colours !,the size and colours of this pool make it stand out from the others - plenty of walks around where you can get different perspectives and some stunning photos
291,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Toledo, OH ","Beautiful, especially on a sunny day","One of my favorite parts about this is it is accessible. You can totally take a stroller or a wheelchair - it is all a boardwalk. The colors are beautiful, especially on a sunny day. There is parking but if going in the middle of the day you will likely just have to park on the shoulder. There are no bathrooms at this particular stopping point but I’m sure there are some nearby."
292,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,Gurgaon ,june 2019,"a great site. You must walk the 1.8 mile trek and go up to see its Grand View. Need to walk for 20 mins but it is amazing from the Top. Later you can go to Car park next to it, but the view may not be as good from Boardwalk. MUST SEE."
293,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"New York City, NY ",Limited Parking,"Grand Prismatic Spring is in the west of Old Faithful. They have very limited parking. However, you won’t disappoint to stop by and walk around the loop."
294,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"Dallas, TX ",WOW.,"One of the coolest things I've ever seen. the largest hot spring in the US. In addition to the colors, there's a boiling waterfall that falls into a river and a large crater. Only takes about an hour to visit. Easy trail."

297,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Seattle, WA ",Wow,"Go early!!!!!!!!! This is a spot that you will want to linger at. Best to visit when the crowds are small. Also, the sunrise there is worth whatever inconvenience comes with sleep deprivation."
298,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Friends,"Abilene, TX ",This place gave me chills,"Wow! Grand Prismatic for me in the early morning and staying around a while and watching it’s beauty change with the sun was amazing , this was my favorite !!"

300,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Loveland, CO, ",Spectacular place to see,The grand Prismatic Spring is very unique place. It is a large thermal with many micro bacteria. The heat reflects the beauty with different colors. Best to park at fairy falls and hike up to see the place from the observation place. You can see the complete formation. Then head down to the thermal parking area to walk around the spring. Worth your time spent in this place.
301,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Rome, Italy ",just too beautiful,again the hike up to see an top side view with all the colors is worth the views and I return again every trip
302,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Germantown, MD ",Take the hike behind spring,There is a boardwalk along the Grand Prismatic Spring. But for the picture perfect view there is a small parking lot with some springs just past the GPS. There is a trail which is maybe 1/2 mile with an incline. When you get to the top there is a large deck for the optimum view. Well worth the hike and bring water.
303,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Pecatonica, IL, ",Great hike to the Grand Prismatic!,"There are great boardwalk trails here. Again, try to do this earlier or later in the day when crowds are more manageable. We went to Fairy Falls late one afternoon and did the mile hike (or so) up to the viewpoint to look down on Grand Prismatic Spring. This really shows off the great colors."
304,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Coggeshall, UK ",Lovely colours,We parked in the fairy falls parking lot and walked about three quarters of a mile to the Grand Prismatic Spring overlook. It was a nice walk and offers good views of the Spring
305,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019,not available,"Naperville, IL ",Breathtaking,Beautiful place! Very easily accessible. Wheelchair friendly. A short walk to the Prismatic Spring. The colors and the view is just breathtaking. Be careful of your hats & other loose items especially on a windy day.
306,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Boise, ID ",A must!,A must see! Absolutely breathtaking! Tip: wear a tight fitting hat or leave it in the car. We saw about 6 hats laying in the thermal area.
307,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family, ,Beyond Beautiful,If you park and hike up the hill you can get a great view from higher up. Pictures don’t do justice.
308,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,New Jersey ,Nature at it's best,"This is one of the best places in Yellowstone national park. You must in this place. This is the most colorful hot spring of the all in the park. This is in the middle geyser basin.  Few tips:  The spring trail is wheelchair and stroller accessible.  The trail doesn't is open. So if you are carrying a baby/kid, please be careful.  The trail and the place are mostly humid. So be careful while stepping.  If you are waring any cap/hat, please control it as the place is very windy."
309,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Friends,"London, UK ",Beautiful but be careful when you go,"We visited the Grand Prismatic Spring on a very cold day in May. Although I'm sure it would be lovely, we unfortunately couldn't see the actual spring because of all the steam. I assume it was because the weather was so cold. The picture is all we could see from the board walk. And unfortunately the trail where you can see it from above was closed in mid May. I'd suggest going on a warmer day to be sure you can see it!"
310,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Edgewood, MD ",Not quite like the photos but cool,"Not as stunning as ggv by he online shots in person, and it may change throughout the season. Plank walkway takes you around this and excalibur springs. Small parking area and very crowded. Restrooms available."
311,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Summer visit,The Grand prismatic is one of the most sought after spots for the tourists and is aptly so. The fantastic color combinations is just out of the world. It seems like some painter has done an exclusive work there with his his brushes.Its hard to capture this beautiful thing in the camera. It has to be seen wirh your own eyes to capture it in your mind.
312,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019,not available,"Oklahoma City, OK ",WOW!,Not much parking so get there early. We were lucky enough to get a close up view of a buffalo grazing right alongside the sidewalk of the parking lot. You will have to walk up hill on a boardwalk to get to the springs but it is worth the walk. See the hot water running downhill into the river on your way to the spring. You can feel the heat from the hot springs as you wonder at the color and clarity.
313,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,Duenweg MO ,Absolutely gorgeous,My husband and I took the overlook path to view the spring. It was everything we expected and more. Got to watch a large bear walk across the mud surrounding the spring.
314,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2018 , Family, ,Well built boardwalk that lets you get quite close,"It was great to see the Grand Primastic Spring in person after having seen so many photos online. On the boardwalk you don't get quite as good a view as the aerial photography you've probably seen but it's still quite cool. Depending on the temperature/fog of the day, you may be able to see more color. I was impressed with the well built boardwalk, this is a very accessible attraction for old and young."
315,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Family,"Preston, UK ",Breathtaking,This was one of the highlights of our 3 days in Yellowstone. Make the effort to walk up to the overview vantage point because you will not be disappointed.
316,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Mobile, AL ",Absolutely amazing,This area of springs is located on the west side of the park north of Old Faithful. There is a boardwalk through the area. The springs are colorful and generate heavy smoke. The smoke takes on the color of the spring creating a surreal sight. This is one of the most amazing things is Yellowstone. Do not miss it even though you may have to wait to find a parking place.
317,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Des Moines, IA ",Amazing view from Fairy Falls overlook,"Beautiful colors, amazing nature to see, best seen from up on the Fairy Falls overlook trail, which has very limited parking. We had to park along the road at about 10 AM, and walk 2 miles to the overlook, which was very uphill for the last 1/4 mile. But the view and colors and scene was amazing."
318,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Wow!,What a breathtaking sight! Walk is long and uphill. Too difficult for some elderly travelers. Mosquitoes were very bad near and at the top. But WOW! Well worth it!
319,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2019,not available,"Pittsburgh, PA ",Disappointing,"It is awesome that this is a natural spring but if you are expecting the picturesque colorful spring advertised in photos, that is not what you will see! All I saw was steam and the edge of the water which is pretty but the pictures are very misleading. Still very beautiful though."
320,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Cape Coral, FL ",A beautiful place to visit under the right conditions,"We chose to see the Great Prismatic Spring on a nice, bright day but didn't realize that if you want to see the spring through all the steam it generates, you need to go on a windy day. One person was overheard telling someone else to snap a picture of the poster so you can see what you're missing.    But missing the beauty of the spring was not the end of the day for us. The walk up to the spring is fantastic with other springs, pools and water flows to the river running along side this site. We missed seeing the main attraction but still were very happy we went."
321,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,Maryland ,OUR FAVORITE,"By far, this was the most stunning basin. We read reviews and learned to take the Fairy Falls trail to view this from up high. It's a 20 minute walk with the last part a steep uphill trek but oh, is it worth it! The mosquitoes were terrible that night!! Wear long pants or spray insect spray before doing this. When the sun is shining it's completely different! We got both sunny and cloudy photos and it was cool to document the changes!"
322,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Family,"Atlanta, GA, ",Watch for a clear day & go!,Sadly both days we were at Yellowstone it was cold & the fog created an almost invisible view of the Grand Prismatic Sorinf. We tried at multiple points of the day to see but sadly only could see some colors occasionally poking through. Popular and parking fills up quickly so go early!
323,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,Pennsylvania ,Kind of disappointing,"The day we went we could see very little of the spectacular colors you see in pictures. The steam clouded the view completely, with only occasional hints of the color. The parking line was long and slow, by far the worst we experienced in the park. I'm sure it's great sometimes, but the photos taken by drones on pristine days are kind of misleading, in my opinion."
324,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"Fremont, CA ",Go when it's bright and sunny,"We were there in Yellowstone for three days and we visited this place all three days only to see steam. Day 1 was totally cloudy and all we saw was nothing. Day 2 was worse. While passing this area it was sunny but by the time we parked and ran to the board walk, the sun was hidden in the clouds and the effort went waste. Day 3 was better . We started quite early and got to see some part of the spring which was gorgeous.    Tips:  1.The steam forms the clouds above. Avoid the place when it's cloudy. go early on a sunny day. Try and hike till the overlook. We did not have that in our plan but have heard the view is better there. Have also heard that the view is clear during late August and September, but I am not sure about this.    2 . AVOID TOUR BUSES. Try and go early in the morning or late evening. I had shocking experiences . The tour bus people behave as if the entire place belongs to them. They are in such a hurry that sometimes you feel you will be thrown off the boardwalk. Another sick experience...Day 1 when we had just parked, two men from one of such bus entered the woods in front of the parking and started peeing. All this when there was a toilet just opposite to that place. I was too shocked and embarrassed. Not sure how to deal with such people.  Wouldn't like to generalize...not all people are same... but similar attitude was seen at all major points in Yellowstone.    3. Avoid wearings accessories which are light and can get flown away. One of the days we went was quite windy and there were so many hats and caps which had flown into the spring and spoilt the bacterial mats. That's such a shame."
325,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Lewes, UK ","Wow, what a spectacle","Literally just parked the car and followed other walkers in the area, walk not too difficult but quite long but well worth it. Having seen such springs in New Zealand wasn’t sure I would be that impressed - but this is just huge and so beautiful. Would recommend."
326,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"Denver, CO ",Beautiful from the overlook!,"There is a moderate hike from Fairy Falls trailhead that is SO worth it! It gives the best view of the springs & lets you avoid some of the crowds (still plenty if people, but the boardwalk & main parking below looked way worse!). Our 7 & 9 yr. olds did the hike with no problem. Even saw a bison the trail on the way down. Just a side note, please remember to keep a safe distance from the wildlife - don't be like the people we saw that posed their kids 10 ft. from a bison, please!!"
327,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family, ,GP Spring,"Great- a must see. Make sure you park at Fiery Falls parking lot in order to hike up the hill, not far, in order to see it from above. The other parking lot you can only walk around the outside of it."
328,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Highbridge, UK ",Amazing,"These pools are amazing, the colours are fantastic, but the smell is not so great when it first hits you. Well worth a look though."
329,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"Green Bay, WI ",Awesome but cliudy,"Went to see the spring in a sunny day. There was so much steam coming off of it, it was hard to see...."
330,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Dayton, OH ",Dissapointment,As others have stated this is a key site in Yellowstone which means it gets CROWDED. By the time we made our way to this feature (around noon) cars were backing up and not moving much We were trying to turn left and luckily someone let us in line. Even so we must have waited 30 or more minutes for a parking space. Then we made the truck over the bridge to the boardwalk leading to the grand prismatic. The boardwalk was extremely crowded and some foreign tour bus groups were incredibly rude and aggressive. It was a cold windy day which meant tat steam billowed out from the pools. Bottom line— it was impossible to see what we had endured so much to see. Even so when we pulled out the back up of cars waiting to turn right or left into the parking area was unbelievable. My recommendation: if it very cold don’t bother to go. If you do go make it the first site of the day. We went in June and it snowed the day after our visit(on the first day of summer)
331,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Port Orchard, WA ",A Geothermal Psychedelic Trip,"This is about the coolest thing ever. From the parking lot you will take a long trudge along a boardwalk past many, many geothermal phenomena that are kind of interesting and definitely stinky. The Grand Prismatic is at the top of the hill, and as you approach, you are in for a really overwhelming sort of beauty full unimaginable colors, both within the pool and on the ground, but somehow reflected in the steam that comes of the massive pool. The boardwalk affords a lot of different views of the pool, and many wonderful photo ops, and you will walk away from the pool a changed person. The whole world will look a little bit different, and even better in some ways. Kind of a Sixties thing, if you follow my drift. Best advice is to go early in the day to beat the tour busses. And if you see a tour bus there, go somewhere else nearby and come back when the bus in gone. In my case, the tour bus pulled in as I made my way down from the Grand Prismatic, and as the massive throngs of tourists tramped and jostled their way past me wielding their selfie sticks like swords...well, that's when you need to be ready for a real downer, man."
332,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples, ,Amazing place,This is such an amazing site - lots of Geysers and amazingly beautiful - can be busy with coach tours so time your visit early or later in day
333,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Friends,"Allentown, PA, ",Go when it’s sunny,"If it’s cloudy, wait for another day. And definitely do the hike to the overlook. It isn’t difficult and gives a much better viewpoint."
334,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Colors are amazing,This is something that looks just like the pictures you see. The blues in all of the springs are caribbean blue.
335,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Pretty cool!,The spring is spectacular. I recommend viewing from the Fairy Falls overlook for the best view and less crowds. We tried to view from the deck several times but we were unable to see much besides steam regardless of the time we arrived. Each time we parked on the main road and just walked through the parking lot as the line to park was horrendous. The Fairy Falls entrance is right next to the Grand Prismatic entrance and is only a short (although steep) hike up to view the springs.
336,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,"Pagosa Springs, CO ",Yellowstone 2019,It’s easy to tell when you are at a popular attraction in the park - the crowds are beyond belief. The Spring is one of those attractions. It was like being in a crowded airport escalator - you have to move with the crowd. There are no passing lanes. We got there early in the season and we still suffered the crowds. Having said that - it was worth it. The colors are incredible and I am always impressed with the sheer size of this Spring.
337,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Cuyahoga Falls, OH ",Must-see while in Yellowstone!,"Make sure you go to the upper observation point and also the lower deck to walk to the spring. And I can't stress to you enough - GO EARLY. Or you will not find parking and have to park on the road a mile or more out. We were camping and were up pretty early and at the parking lot for the upper observation point (follow the signs to Fairy Falls, that's where you park). We walked up there, saw the overhead views then came back down, drove up the road to the actual parking area for the spring and by 8am it was almost full. We were ok getting a spot but I can't stress to you enough how quickly it fills up. We drove by once later in the day and couldn't get over how far the line of cars stretched down the road waiting or else parking to trek in.    The spring was amazing though! The colors are beautiful and it's like being on another planet. It was probably my favorite thing in the park!"
338,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",Breathtaking,Every corner you turn in Yellowstone there is something new to see. This is a busy popular area but try to get there early and take a peek.
339,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Berlin, CT ",Colors,The Grand Prismatic Spring is a site to see the natural colors are amazing. It's a bit of a hike but totally worth it.
340,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"Dayton, OH ",Can’t miss,Even though it was crowded with people that can’t stop taking pictures it is well worth the stop to see this beautiful work of art in the park. Easy walk...be patient when the parking lot is full—it’s worth it!
341,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,Arkansas ,BEAUTIFUL,Highly recommend if you are visiting Yellowstone!!! Get there early though because crowds can be overwhelming. This photo was from the Fairy Falls Trail. It is a short walk to an overlook to see the beautiful colors of Grand Prismatic. In my opinion this was a better view than walking the boardwalk around it because you can see all of the colors. Definitely a do not miss if you visit Yellowstone!
342,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Weston super Mare, UK ",beautiful,"The colours are amazing - and more so on a day with clear blue skies, which we were lucky enough to have."
343,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"Spencer, VA ",#1 place not to miss in Yellowstone,"This place is simply amazing and pictures can never do it justice. Put this in your must see list in Yellowstone. I’ll be honest, I had never heard of it before. However, once you see it you will never forget it. Here is my advice: you can see Grand Prismatic Spring two ways the boardwalk or the overlook. We stayed away from the boardwalk because it was too busy. Our family parked at the Fairy Falls Trailhead and walked a little way and a sign on the left said Grand Prismatic Spring Overlook. It is a little hike up a hill but trust me, if I can do this almost anyone else can too. The hike up to the overlook is beautiful but when you get to the top you will be amazed!"
344,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Grand Junction, CO ",Nice basin but to see Grand Prismatic the view is better form Fairy Falls Trail,Grand Prismatic Spring is part of Midway Geyser Basin. It is a very popular area due to this attraction. Many\y folks park on the road and walk in. There is a nice boardwalk with a number of geysers and hot springs to see. Grand Prismatic is of course the star but it is hard to see in total since it is so large and much of is further back than you can see from the boardwalk. Plus there is so much steam your view can be obstructed. It is possible that a better view is from Fairy Falls Trail. The trail head with parking a bit further south toward Old Faithful.
345,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Family,"Charlotte, NC, ",Overlook is the only way to see this.,"We made the mistake of coming to the Midway Basin parking area and walking the boardwalk surrounding the Grand Prismatic, on our first time out. It didn't help that the weather was fairly lousy the way we did it, but with the cold air and the steam, along with cloudy skies, it was really difficult to see anything from the ground level.  The next day we went to the overlook. If you drive just pass the Grand Prismatic parking area, you'll see another parking area marked for ""Fairy Falls."" Park here, and then take a very easy hike up to the Grand Prismatic overlook. It's a little over a mile to get there, but most of it is a flat hike until the very end where you go up hill to get to the overlook. The view from up there is 100 times better than the one at the bottom. Plus, there aren't nearly as many Chinese tour groups."
346,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Friends,"Aiken, SC ",Indescribable,Our party of seven were beyond amazed at the beauty of the Spring. This is a must see when visiting Yellowstone National Park.
347,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Haines City, FL ",Go to the overlook!,"When walking the midway basin, it seems insane! There is so much steam blowing around your glasses are constantly fogging. You’re not sure if you’re hot or cold...it’s crazy. When looking at Grand Prismatic Spring from boardwalk level, it seems interesting and different, but you need to take the hike from Fairy Fall trail to get a birds eye view! That’s when you see what all the pictures show! It’s a good little hike, but well worth it!"
348,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,New York ,Senasational!,What a day! Parked at Fairy Falls trailhead and did the hike to the falls. Easy hike up and down - about two hours round trip- with the most beautiful falls to enjoy. We did take bear spray as there were warnings posted that there had been recent bear activity. On the way there is the best private view of Grand Prismatic Spring as well as a few smaller springs! No crowds and amazing view. Fairy Falls is a special place too- we loved our time there.
349,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Belfast, UK ",Will Never Forget This Experience!!,"Without a doubt one of the most memorable experience of my life, outstanding natural beauty.    Tip :- try to arrive before 10am - after 10am trying to find a parking can be extremely difficult."
350,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,"Fort Lauderdale, FL ",As beautiful live in person as it is in photos,"The climb is tiring if you are not acclimated, but it was worth it. Seeing it on ground level is not that impressive, but viewing from the observation point - WOW! Awesome."
351,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,"Elyria, OH ",Another Amazing Spot,The view changes depending on the weather. We went in early May and had a wonderful time. So much to see.
352,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,"Ventura County, USA ",Too much steam to see Grand Prismatic the day we went.,"In May, the weather is cold and it rains/snows/sleets a lot. So much steam was coming off Grand Prismatic it was not possible to see it and the overlook trail was closed. I've heard it is better to see this in July and August. Everything else at this stop was great to see, though."
353,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Keizer, OR ",Stop and see the spectacle,Incredible array of colors. Easy walk along the boardwalk. Take the time to stop and marvel at this incredible site.
354,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Friends,"Bridgeton, NJ ",Always great to see,The Grand Prismatic is always great to see and is another must see of Yellowstone. I’ve always visits on clearer days but this visit had a lot of the steam blowing into the crowd and obstructing our view. That’s ok.
355,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,"Corona, CA ",Surreal Beauty,Walking around this spring is surreal! The colors are so magnificent that they seem to be dyed! There is an overlook called Fairy Falls trail which will give you a better perspective to see the color blends! The trail is not overwhelming and definitely gives you a more spectacular display of the colors!
356,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Family,"Crossville, TN ",Nature's Hot Tub,"Don't miss the springs. Obviously you can't use them as your hot tub, but the clear and beautiful springs are worth the effort to find parking and to move around the well-placed walkways."
357,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,"Troy, TX ",Too Cold When We Visited,"There is an important fact to consider if visiting this spring and wanting to see the rainbow colors, it has to be warm. We went on a 38 degree morning and the steam was like being in fog. We couldn’t see anything. Never occurred to us. We will catch it next time."
358,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"North Myrtle Beach, SC ",Loved it,This spring was simply beautiful and if I had to chose just one other than old faithful this would be the one.

360,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2019 , Couples,"Philadelphia, PA ",Very colorful,"We came before the other viewing area was open so parking was extremely limited. The pools are very colorful but we knew we needed to see it from above. We asked a Ranger if there was a place to view from above and they said yes, but that trail is closed because Grizzly bears hunt during this time of year around that area.

364,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Apr 2019 , Couples,"Las Vegas, NV ",Could have been a lot better.,"We had the misfortune of showing up at the springs on a very cold day. Being cold wasn't the problem for us. It was the fact that the cold caused the air over the springs to turn to steam a lot more than a hot day would have and we couldn't hardly even see the springs. Even standing on the boardwalks, you couldn't see the springs."

To get the best view you need to park by the Fairy Trail and walk up to the viewing platform. We also parked up at the bottom and walked around it up close. This area is very popular so be prepared to circle the car park a few times for a space to open up. Worth viewing it from both areas, up high and on the ground.    This is absolutely something you must see whilst in YNP, you will never ever see anything else like in your life, just mesmerising."

The answer is NOT Old Faithful, it's the Grand Prismatic Spring. It's an unearthly, beyond beautiful, nebula come to Earth in the Midway Geyser Basin. There is so much to see and do in Yellowstone, you will be overwhelmed and you absolutely will not see everything. Pick and choose wisely due to your interests and time constraints, considering that there will often be construction, animal-jams, traffic, and parking issues. That goes for almost every sight at Yellowstone. That being said, here is a general reminder to behave: Do not leave trails, pay attention to signs, don't approach wildlife, and use your common sense. Just because you see someone else doing it doesn't mean it is okay for you to do it as well. No picture is worth destroying and disrespecting our natural resources for. That being said, be patient when you visit, because it will make your visit more enjoyable. Enjoy the Grand Prismatic Spring!"

This area is well worth finding, it's past the pool and then a turning off to the right I think, worth researching."
374,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jan 2019 , Family,"Fort Collins, CO ","Great, but not what I thought","Loved the boardwalk stroll around Grand Prismatic, but it was not what we expected - seeing the spring from ground level is much different than the photos you see.    Fortunately, the other active features, as well as the river are rewarding and interesting. It was a bit cooler during our visit, so the entire area was very steamy.    If you want any chance at enjoying this spot, you have to come very early, or late in the evening. If you come any time between 8am-5pm, you will be hard pressed to find parking and tripping over crowds on the boardwalk."
375,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Family, ,Best yellow in the world!,"Yellowstone National Park is packed with beautiful locations for you to enjoy and photograph and Grand Prismatic Spring is definitely one of them. The easiest way to see it is to pull off the highway 191 and park at the dedicated parking lot (can be full though, so go early and avoid weekends and holidays if possible). But when you get there do not hurry across that bridge you'll see right near the parking lot, first take a short trail between the river and highway 191 and enjoy those colorful streams of Grand Prismatic Spring flowing into Firehole River on the opposite side, see photo attached (approx. location is 44.527375, -110.835459). Then go across the bridge and you'll find some more fun. Definitely worth bringing your camera, you'll have to walk on wooden trails, just don't fall off when taking selfies :)"

Sincere,  Steve"
377,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Dec 2018 , Family, ,Chilly walk in winter,Visited the park by snow coach off season. The walk was worth it to see the area without a huge group of people. Our guide was informative and knew the area well. I would definitively recommend the effort to visit off season. Photo is of the Opal pool.
378,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"St Helens, UK ",One of the Park's Highlights,The colours make this feature. We viewed it from ground level on the walkway and also from an elevated position on another day from the overlook walk. I strongly recommend both. On the ground level we saw it less clearly due to the amount of steam. The overlook is at quite a distance but the overall view is stupendous.

Words cannot describe!
381,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Lockport, IL ",Incredible Colors,After a while all all the hot springs really started looking a like but this one was real different. The colors were incredible and the walk around the springs was really nice. The only bad part were the crowds. If you are in Yellowstone I would stop by and take the walk.
382,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Columbus, OH, ",View Must be from Overlook,"It's a waste of time to see this from ground level, you must hit the overlook to get a good view of it.

383,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family, ,It is so amazing,"This is one of the amazing attraction of yellowstone that you can’t miss. There are two places you can visit this attraction. One is a walk from the parking lot which is around 10 minutes and it is so wonderful going through the steam arising from the geysers. Wind plays a big role when you are viewing this attraction, if it is windy, you will see more steam blowing horizontally and impacting the visibility. From this spot, it’s great to see but may not be good for taking pictures.    Second place is to view from an elevated place and this is a small hike from other parking lot. When you see this ring from the top, it is awe inspiring, mother nature at best in vibrant colors. This spot is perfect for taking picture and you will have awesome prism in your background. Loved it."
384,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Jackson, WY, ",Astonishing,"However, this time of the year, too early for snowmobiles and too late for cars and buses, it would be a backcountry adventure requiring a permit for camping in the snow to experience. You may find it anticlimactic in the winter as the cold air temperatures make for so much vapor you probably will not see the incredible blue this spring is famous for. Even so, missing out on the crowds of summer, this place takes on an even more unearthly character. It’s utter immensity and silent grandeur makes this an amazing winter destination. You will need snow shoes or cross country skis to make it to the overlook accessed from the Fairy Falls Trailhead but the Midway Geyser Basin Trail is usually trafficked after 16 December by enough people you can walk in their footprints, often 1 meter above the plastic boardwalk as the walk is insulated from the ground temperature.  If you walk here, in winter, you will be among one of the slimmest of Yellowstone visitation demographics. You will be rewarded."

Make this one of your first stops and do both trails - the one that allows you to walk through the springs and the trail that takes you above the springs.

You just can't believe the colors. It's difficult to photograph because from the walkway in front you really can't see everything, and the lighting and view depends on the time of day, cloud cover, air temperature/humidity (steam), etc. Next time we visit I want to take the trail that leads to a higher vantage point behind the Spring. I anticipate great views and pictures."

Once you got to the Spring and walked around the flat wooden walkway, you got to smell all the sulfur scents and feel the heat from the springs! My favorite geothermal activity!"
396,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Cape Town, South Africa ",Amazing,The spring is unbelievably big and is worth it to do the small trail to get to the overlook instead of the boardwalk at the bottom.

397,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Cleveland, OH ","The Hotter it is outside, the better the view!","This is a great place to hike and see. The overlook is awesome. Keep in mind, with the water being so hot, when it is cold or cool out, the steam pretty much obscures the view. It is not a problem as you get to see steam tornadoes going up and such...and occasionally the breeze opens it up...the better time would be when it is warmer outside and the steam would not be as much."
398,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Washington DC, DC ",Arrive early if you expect to park,"Part of the Midway Geyser Basin, this is the largest hot spring is the US. Its vivid yellows, blues and greens are renown throughout the world. Although many people want to see it, there is only limited nearby parking. While we were advised to arrive before 10:30 AM, the lot fills much sooner than that. We failed to park on our first attempt and returned by 9 AM the next day. As the temperature had dropped below freezing, geyser steam encased nearby pine trees in ice and endangered walkers on the raised paths. From ground-level, it was so steamy, we couldn't see the touted colors. As a fallback, we hiked to the Overlook (from the Fairy Falls Trailhead). Oddly, the turnoff is only marked ""Trail"", but just follow the people. By the time we arrived, we well understood why this is so visited. Definitely see it from the Overlook if you have time."
399,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Kansas City, MO, ",Simply stunning!,This is one of the most beautiful thermal sites in the park. We first stopped late one afternoon to walk on the boardwalk surrounding the pool; the steamy vapor didn’t allow for very good photos. Next morning we stopped and walked about 15-20 minutes out on the Fairy Falls Trail and from there we got a great view of the Grand Prismatic Pool and some great photos. Definitely worth the effort!

403,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Los Angeles, CA ",Mysterious and colorful,"We were there in October, when the sky was overcast and cloudy. The deep colors in the spring are dependent on sunlight. Yet, this was still a wonderful experience, walking all the way around the various springs in the area, listening to other people's stories about their experiences in the park.  It's not a difficult walk.  With the heat from the spring and the cold air, there was a magical mist over the springs that would clear as the wind whipped it away, then return to cover the springs protectively."
404,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2018,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",Largest hot spring in the United States,"The Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park is the largest hot spring in the United States and the third largest in the world, after Frying Pan Lake in New Zealand and Boiling Lake in Dominica. Located in the Midway Geyser Basin, it was noted by geologists in the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 and named by them for its striking coloration. Interestingly, its colors match the rainbow dispersion of white light by an optical prism: red, orange, yellow, green and blue. While the Hayden expedition may have named the hot spring, it didn't discover it. The first records of the Grand Prismatic Spring are from early European explorers and surveyors. In 1839, a group of fur trappers from the American Fur Company crossed the Midway Geyser Basin and made note of a ""boiling lake"" with a diameter of 300 feet. In 1870, the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition visited the spring, noting a 50-foot geyser (later named Excelsior) nearby. On the same journey, Washburn named Old Faithful. To be accurate, the Grand Prismatic Spring is 370 feet in diameter and 160 feet deep. It discharges an estimated 560 gallons of 160-degree water per minute."
405,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2018 , Solo,"Columbus, OH ",Fantastic,"We took the overlook trail and viewed from above. It was a very steamy spring that day and had a little bit of an obstructed view. But, the view was amazing, some really great colors in there. Glad that i stopped at the overlook to view the spring."
406,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Buffalo, NY ",It’s Worth the Hassle!,"Without a doubt, the best viewing point to see the Grand Prismatic Spring is from above at the new overlook. But, getting there is another matter!    The parking is insufficient, the signage is horrible, and the last part of the trail is slippery and steep. But if you endure all of that, the view at the top is sublime!    We were coming from Old Faithful, and drove right past the Fairy Trail sign by the time we saw it, and had to turn around. Although we were there in late September, and the crowds in the park were a lot less than in summer, the parking area was still completely jammed. It would have been nice if they would have enlarged the parking for this trail with the new overlook. The lack of enough parking for this area is truly ridiculous.    Once we did finally park, there were no signs directing you to the trail. We figured it out once we watched where people we going. You have to head toward a path to the right of the parking lot. The main trail itself is pretty easy and level, but there are conflicting descriptions on how long it is. The park website says its 1.2 miles roundtrip, but we think it is closer to 2 miles as per other website descriptions. The only sign directing you to the spring simply says “Trail”, and points to a path heading up a hill. Again, we asked people coming from that direction to confirm we were going the right way.    The uphill climb involves walking up a very steep gravelly path that has several switchbacks that get you to the top. We are puzzled why the park put in some nice easy to navigate steps at Inspiration Point, but left this hill as a steep slippery mess. It was tricky going up, but trickier coming down. I hate seeing trails rated as “easy” when they really aren’t. For older individuals or families with children, this part of the trail can be challenging. You can forget strollers or walkers/wheelchairs, it’s not handicap friendly.    For the best viewing, especially in September when it starts getting colder, you’ll want to see the spring no earlier than late morning into the afternoon. If you go too early when it is cold, all you’ll see is fog. We had a gorgeous view from the overlook, and decided it was definitely worth the hassle. It is a superior view compared to the boardwalk at eye level. The blues and oranges of this huge spring really is nature at its finest. Just be prepared to spend a couple hours here between the parking and the trail. Your patience will be rewarded!"
407,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Bowling Green, KY ",Majestic,This is one of the most iconic spots in Yellowstone and a site you will not want to miss. It is best seen by hiking up the trail to the overlook to photograph this beautiful spring. The hike is not difficult and well worth the amazing view. This spring is also worth getting a closer look at by simply using the boardwalk at the basin of the spring and walking around it. Gorgeous!

409,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Chelmsford, UK ",A Little Effort and You See the Postcard,You can see this at ground level but if the steam is in the wrong direction you are going to have limited sight. Best head towards Fairy Falls trail car park and walk the distance to the overlook you can see from the ground level boardwalk. The walk is easy until the turn off up the hill - we saw many people struggling but persevere and your view is superb without any steam. Take time with your photos and you will get close to postcard standard. Looking down to this area just reminds you how volatile the whole area is.
410,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"United Kingdom, ",Stunning,"This is probably the most famous geothermal spring in the park. Often seen as an aerial postcard, you can reach it at ground level by taking the walkway at Biscuit Basin. However depending which way the steam is blowing and the weather generally you will get a very limited view.    Instead drive a mile further on to the Fairy Falls parking (if you can get in) and walk about 3/4 mile following the signs for the observation point and Fairy Falls. Here you have a more distant view, but you can see the spring from a higher elevation and therefore appreciate the size, and colours."

The steam from the springs engulfed us repeatedly and really obscured most most of our photos. For the best photos, I suggest going up above the springs on the newly refurbished Prismatic Springs Overlook. You stay on a boardwalk around the springs. This is imperative since the crust below the boardwalk is thin and you could fall through. The colors are amazing and the sheer size is impressive. This is really more than one spring, and well worth taking the time to visit."

Here one gets close, sees the mineral laden flow as it heads to the stream below, and there is the mood of the mist from the hot water... the walk is uphill but not strenuous and is only perhaps 400 yards, 5 or at slowest, 10 minutes walk.  2) The next parking area to the south is labeled ""Fairy Falls"" but parking here gives trail access to a one mile, 20 minute walk to the Grand Prismatic Spring Overlook, the view here gives an entirely different impression, assigning scale and giving a real view of the never seen anywhere else in nature intense blue tones of color. Awe was my several minutes long silent reaction.    I would suggest that both views are a must for even a one day visit to Yellowstone, right up there with Old Faithful."
428,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"San Francisco, CA ",Beautiful!,Make sure to go to the viewpoint by Fairy Falls trail to really see the spring. Seeing it from ground level is nowhere as impressive!
429,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Damascus, MD ",Highlight of Yellowstone,"TIP: Go to the overlook to see the spring from above. We got the tip to go to the overlook from one of the tour guides, and he was spot on. When you look at it from ground level, you cannot see the beautiful colors. It is a bit of an uphill hike but well worth it. The signs are not very good - - when the trail splits, take the left fork uphill (the right fork goes to the falls)."
430,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Too windy or wrong time of day...,All we saw at the time we went was a bunch of steam! It was late afternoon and we weren't able to see any colors other than some blue.
431,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Tacoma, WA ",Do not miss this,Even if the parking lot is full you'll want to circle around and find a spot because you do not want to miss the Grand Prismatic if you haven't seen it before. I recommend you take the short walk up to the observation point before walking the boardwalk with the crowds. The view is a perfect spot for pictures and a place to really see the colors in the spring. After that go ahead (if you have time) to walk the boardwalk.
432,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples, ,Very pretty,Nice to see from the main area but to really appreciate the colors you have to drive a little further park and do a small hike to see from above
433,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Inverness, UK ",Non existent signage - Beware,"Driving from the South we came upon a large and very full car park and assumed this would be for the Grand Prismatic Spring as no other significant features are listed on the NPS map.    There was no signage but we set off in the direction of lots of people returning. We were surprised it was such a distance but could see folk on Boardwalks ahead so assumed we were nearly there. But no. We could see no way the track we were on was going to link up. Fortunately we met two hikers coming in the opposite direction who told us we were on the Fairy Falls trail. They told us to back track and take the trail we had earlier passed going up the hill which was the overlook trail.    I had ignored that very prominent and substantial path because the Lonely Planet Guide (latest edition) described that as a “faint path”! This well constructed track is actually the way to an excellent viewing platform but the only signage is a marker which says “trail”! As we made our way back to the uphill track we met others who had obviously been under the same misconception.    However, having got to the overlook we were bowled over by the beauty of the view. It is well worth the effort of getting there. We didn’t bother then battling for a parking space at the correct parking lot for the spring as we were happy with what we had seen."

It is as colorful as you see it on all the pictures. It was actually raining when we visited, but we were so amazed to see it. Can‘t imagine how it looks like during better weather. Next time we‘ll do the hike. It seems like you can see the spring from above which is probably even better."
436,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Philadelphia, PA ",rainbow water,you can get a good sense and view down on the boards but you need to take the hike behind it up to the vantage point to get a view of the whole area and better sense of the colors.

This is definitely the way to go. The elevated view is spectacular, and while parking is crazy, the deck itself was not crowded at all, even in the middle of the day."
439,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2017 , Solo,"Leiderdorp, The Netherlands ",Must see geyser basin,"When you're in Paris you must see the Eiffel Tower. In Yellowstone you must see the Grand Prismatic Spring. Both locations require some patience to see and take pictures because of the crowds and many selfie-sticks in the air. They are unique and look amazing. However, if you're interested to observe geyser basins more closely in more quiet environment, there are better places in Yellowstone, like the Biscuit basin for example."
440,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Casa Grande, AZ ",WOW!,"The best way to view this is from the upper trail that is accessed from the next stop south of the spring. It's a little walk, but the view is amazing from the top!"

442,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"York, PA ",Patience may be required but this is beautiful,The route through this geyser basin is a one-way walking route because of the density of tourists taking pictures of the themselves with a wonderfully beautiful spring in the background. (Be patient with the Japanese tourists. They will pass once they get their pictures.)    Also be patient for the steam to blow off and give you a glimpse of an amazing thermal feature. It may not be obvious at first but the colors here are astounding.

It was gorgeous BUT there were sooooo many people and they only have a little sidewalk thing that you walk on so it took forever to get up there and back down. There were a lot of people with little kids that were playing in the thermal water - I don’t know why anyone would bring kids that little up there. But no one listens to the signs, you’re not suppose to touch the water. It also sits pretty flush with the spring so you don’t get to see all the colors- I wish there was a way to see it from above."
447,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"North Andover, MA ",Arrive early—then hike to Observation view!,This pool is a must see in the park. The parking lot is ridiculously mobbed unless you get there super early. Goggle the short hike to the observation trail
448,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,Tennessee ,"Awesome to see, but everybody else thinks so, too","The Grand Prismatic Spring is awesome to see but everyone else thinks so, too. It is crowded and parking is limited. Go early or even around 6 PM our tour guide suggested. Our tour bus did not stop here due to the space and time with the crowds. We drove back on our own later. You have a long ramp to zig and zag along until you reach the top. There are a couple of other springs to see here, too, but the one at the top is the favorite. You can also go to the next stop along the road south of the spring to an overlook (sorry cannot remember the name) where you can stand higher than the springs and get a better view. It also gets crowded. This is just a very popular sight. However, people see it and leave and move on so parking does come open regularly."
449,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Friends,"New York City, NY ",Awesome !!!,One of the best places to bust in YNP  Very short walk from parking lot to Prismatic  There are 2 other pools in the same place .  Usually can be done under 30 min if you find parking as its tough.  There is separate bus parking for tour buses where I saw many cars parked .  Must see place in YNP
450,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Friends, ,Absolutely gorgeous color and breathtaking size,"The yellow, orange and brown colorization of the area surrounding the Grand Prismatic Spring was absolutely gorgeous. The pool itself, however, was too far away from the boardwalk and one can only see a sliver of the pool surface. From the information at the beginning of the boardwalk which showed an aereal view of the pool, it looked fabulous. However, you won't be able to see it at ground level. Still, the colorful area surrounding the pool was huge and awe inspiring."
451,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Bexhill-on-Sea, UK, ",Probably my favourite spot in Yellowstone.,"You have to see this special sight. You can get up close, but I preferred the view from the overlook at the back. You have to park a little further to the south and it is about a mile walk back to the spring."

Only way to view this jaw dropping area,"#2 sites to visit in Yellowstone, 5* a jaw dropper, took many awe inspiring pictures here, and wish I had more time to spend here. Plan to stay at least half a day for this and neighboring paths with more crystal clear blue boiling ponds, a color not captured well on cameras, but viewing with a polarized lens is a game changer. Parking lot was small, was only spot where I had to circle around and wait for a spot to open. Many tour buses come here and crowd the area with groups of 50, planning your time is key to enjoy this spot. Sunrise-10:30am- would be my recommendation of time to visit. After lunch it gets very crowded on 1 way boardwalk. Bacteria mats formed was one of the stellar geological formations, I've never seen anything like it anywhere else. This warm, steamy area smells earthly, not eggy which made the experience even better. The warm steam felt stupendous after a cold rainy day. I could have stayed longer, but the 1 way boardwalk keeps the line moving. It was tight at most times. Boardwalks are in darn good shape, no issues walking up few steps. Yes, there are stairs to see most of this site."
454,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,Kansas ,Spectacular! It hardly seems real.,"What an amazing piece of nature. We visited the spring first thing in the morning (like 7:30) and there were only 3 cars there. Definitely worth getting there early to avoid the crowds. We walked the boardwalk all around the ground level - it's VERY WET with all the steam and mist so be prepared. My shoes were soaked and I was glad I had my rain jacket. It's especially cool to see this from above, which is from the Fairy Falls trail. The trailhead is just down the road to the south - maybe a mile. It's not easy to find so look for cars set back from the road. It's an easy hike up - maybe a mile - and there's a good payoff."

458,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Friends,"Washington DC, DC ",Beautiful and Colorful,"Grand Prismatic Spring is highly recommended! It is so beautiful with vivid colors, and surroundings add to the charisma of GPS.    My friends and I did the trail to GPS overlook. You start the trail from the Fairy Falls Trailhead and go about 0.6 miles until you arrive at a viewing platform. It is an easy hike and the view is totally worth the effort. Arrive early to avoid the crowds since parking is limited. It really gets crowded as the day goes by. You can also do the boardwalk to GPS but if you are short on time, I would recommend the overlook. That's how you realize the actual grandeur of the Prismatic."
459,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2018 , Solo,"Edison, NJ, ",Amazing,"Beautiful and very colorful. The boardwalk is one way, but once you stop here you'll see why. Lots of other visitors stop to take selfies or have the pictures taken. That said, this is still worth the visit."
460,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"London, UK ",Beautiful sight!,This was a real highlight of our trip to Yellowstone. Grand Prismatic Spring was a truly awesome beautiful sight on a sunny day. The colours are amazing. It is best viewed from above - there is a view point about a mile up the Fairy Falls trail. We also went to the ground level boardwalks to see it close up. A must-see in Yellowstone
461,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,Michigan ,Beautiful Spring View from High Vantage Point,"This is a beautiful spring but you must see it from the high vantage point in order to get to really see the overall spring with all the colors.    You can walk up the boardwalk and get right next to the spring, but it is not the view you see on postcards. You must go to the lookout that can be reached by the Fairy Falls hike. It is a bit of a walk, but well worth the view.    If you only have time for one stop to see the Spring, I highly recommend the High view at Fairy Falls."
462,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Honolulu, HI ","Beautiful Place, WAY Too Many People","Grand Prismatic was one of my must sees in Yellowstone (and it should be for you too). The colors are beautiful and Excelsior Geyser right next door is worth a look too.    What killed some of the enjoyment of the area was the crowd. Multiple Chinese tour buses showed up at the same time and it made the viewing area very tight and uncomfortable. Everyone gets so close that I'm surprised no one got accidentally pushed into the hot spring.    While the place is beautiful and worth a stop, it isn't really one of those places you could comfortably hang out just to enjoy its beauty. Too many people... and this was mid-June."

I would say, start on the board walk to get an eye level view then hiking up the trail behind Grand Prismatic to see it from a higher viewpoint. It's simply amazing. One of my favorite views from my time in Yellowstone."
464,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Eau Claire, WI ",A favorite stop!,"After extensive months of Yellowstone research, Grand Prismatic easily made it to the top of my must-see stops and it didn’t disappoint. Even though it was rainy, cold and overcast the views and features were worth it. We took the bike to the overlook and really enjoyed it although we were unable to get the view you see online. Still worth it and we were able to hang with a chipmunk for a bit too. Win in my book!"
465,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Albany, NY ",The colors were so vivid,"We walked around the boardwalk in the morning. In the afternoon, we hiked to the overlook and viewed morning glory from above."
466,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Solo, ,Just amazing,"Gorgeous sight - looks like some kind of Martian landing. I viewed it from the Overlook on the hill by the Fairy Falls trail. (The parking lot was full up, so I parked at a pullover a little bit up the road. The entire thing was about an hour's worth of walking - to the parking lot, down the trail, up the hill - and back again). But it was soooooo worth it."

The walk there after parking, that can take some time as it was busy, is a little bit of a walk. Loose gravel at times or sand as well. If you walk all the way it will take you around on ground level, there’s a raised boardwalk over some areas. The entrance to the observation deck is before you get the surrounding area on the left. Easy to miss if not looking because of the sights to the right. There’s a somewhat steep climb up to the observation area. Do it. Stop along the way if needed. It’s not an overly long climb up, but the view from above is Amazing!!"

He guaranteed we would have a breath taking view and he was right. We were in luck that day since it was beautiful and the spring was smoking its rainbow colored hue. She is majestic and she will leave you in awe. We also went roadside for a different view and it was also sublime. This is definitely a must see in the park. It was definitely a highlight of mine."

478,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Hasselt, Belgium ",Stunning.,This was a stunning place to visit. We saw it from the boardwalk over the vulcanic grounds but it must be even more impressive if you can see it from the viewing point at the end of a trail that leads you to a higher point. We didn't do the trail as we didn't have the time for it. Nevertheless this place is also impressive without walking the trail. Go early or go after 3PM to beat the crowds.

482,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,Michigan ,Hike To overlook,We enjoyed seeing it initially by doing the one mile hike to the overlook so you can see the colors better! Park at Mystic Falls trail parking area and do the easy hike. Later that night at sunset we came back and did the boardwalk at the actual site which was easy no wait parking only then and no crowds. Way better than waiting to park or hiking long ways to get there that we saw during daytime. Staying at OF inn made this an easy option.

484,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"New York City, NY ","Go early morning, and DEFINITELY do Fairy Falls trail for best views!","The Grand Prismatic is probably the most stunning sight in YNP. Its colors, scale, and beauty are one of its kind. Definitely a must see when you’re in Yellowstone. Two tips when you go:    - Do this early morning to avoid long wait times for parking. Cars are parked almost a mile on the side of the road due to lack of parking spots. We got here around 9:30am and managed to find a few spots open in the main lot, so we got lucky. We came back the next day around 4pm, and the traffic was so backed up, we turned around and left - it would’ve taken us a half hour just to find parking.    - Most people miss this, but the best views of the Grand Prismatic are from the Fairy Falls trail. There’s an awesome overlook there with great views for best pics of the spring. The trail is a mile before Grand Prismatic (coming from Old Faithful), park in the lot and start on the trail - less than half a mile down there’s an arrow marked “Trail” to the left. Take that - steep but short.    Hope this helps!"

487,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Snow Camp, NC ",Another amazing place,"This was one of the more amazing places in Yellowstone. 370 foot across, it has many colors and is different in so many ways than other places similar to it. The parking there is a little hard so try to go earlier or later in the day. We ended up parking on the side of the road and walking about 5 minutes, but it was worth it! We could see animal tracks in the water at the edges. Unfortunately, some people completely ignore the signs that say ""DO NOT MAR THE BACTERIAL MAT""..which is the part in the shallow water that makes the different colors. Sad to see where people have taken sticks and ""written"" in it. But, it doesn't deflect from the experience. Great access, easy walking around it, some steps but not bad."
488,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,Salt lake city ,Must see in Yellowstone,"These springs are some of my favorite things in Yellowstone. The colors are great and you can get relatively close compared to most things in the park. The biggest drawback is the crowds, but that should be expected in Yellowstone unless you go backcountry hiking.    These are on the way from West Yellowstone to old faithful. Easy walks around the springs."
489,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"United States, ",gorgeous,"It's the largest hot spring in the United States, and the third largest in the world, why attract me to go to Yellowstone is because of the picture of this spring that I saw from the web, I think it's the most attractive features in the Yellowstone, and it doesn't make me disappointed, it's really huge and beautiful, it's the MUST see point in Yellowstone, if you haven't been to this point, it would be incomplete for the Yellowstone trip. I take both the overlook and a closer look of the spring. You can see the whole picture of the spring if you go up to the overlook, and you can have a closer look, see the details of the pool and the overflow from it, the reflection of the sky on the overflow is also very beautiful, so I think both overlook and closer look are worth to see, esp. you are the first time to go to Yellowstone. But the parking lot may be quite full in peak season, you may need to wait and drive slowly when going into the parking lot, But it takes about 30 min for this site, so people come and go frequently, so you can still find a parking, as the people won't stay here for a very long time, but the cars going to the the way leading to the parking lot may move slowly. Even at 6pm, there are still groups and groups of tour came here in peak season. While for the parking lot in overlook point, as there is no parking space for coach, there won't be groups of tour, and there is an overflow parking lot as well. But you need to walk about 20-30 min up to the overlook point from the parking lot, so it takes about an hour including taking picture in a round trip when going to the overlook point. Anyway, both views are worthwhile to see."
490,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Downers Grove, IL ",Great views of the Basin,"We were driving north from Old Faithful village and were looking at the map to find this area. We saw a sign for “Fairy Falls” right where we thought the Prysmian Basin should be and there was a parking lot with lots of cars.  We hiked for almost a mile and passed many small hot spring basins and finally reached an overlook of the basin. From that vantage point, you could see everything. But we also saw that if we had driven another quarter mile down the road we would have come to the parking lot for the Grand Prysmian Basin proper. From that parking lot, we saw that there are boardwalks that you can walk that brings you right the edge of the basin. Oh well, we’ll know for next time, although the view from our elevated vantage point was awesome. (and the parking lot at the basin was a zoo). A must see stop if you are already at Old Faithful."
491,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Denver, CO ",WOW!!!!!,"Mother Nature created a beautiful sight. I liked this even more than Old Faithful. The colors are phenomenal and the smaller Spring to the right looks so inviting you just want to jump in. DON'T! My husband and I had talked about Yellowstone for a long  time I am so glad this was the year. I recommend spending a few days here. We camped outside the park about 15 miles from Gardiner, Montana at one of the state parks was awesome. If this is on your bucket list …...DO IT!!!!!!"

You'll have to mess with the crowds, so go early in the day (as with everything else in YS.). It's completely worth it."
496,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Edinburgh, UK ",Must-see in Yellowstone but view it from Fairy Falls trail,"This is stunning and you must see it but the parking at the site is mega-busy. The best way to see it is to park at the trailhead for Fairy Falls just beyond it. On the walk to Fairy falls, you go past an overlook of Grans Prismatic which gives wonderful views and in my opinion is better than doing the close-up boardwalk and having the headache of parking."
497,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Friends,"New York City, NY ",So color full,Amazing the colors you see from up close. Took some great shots. I suggest wearing comfortable sneakers as it's a long walk to the top
498,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,Maryland ,One of the musts in Yellowstone,"Yes, you must stop and visit and walk around Grand Prismatic Spring. Maybe even walk up to Fairy Falls behind Grand Prismatic. But because of crowds, plan beforehand and do it early in the morning. You will better enjoy it with an early start."
499,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Libertyville, IL ","Walk the boardwalk, then hike to the overlook","Grand Prismatic is in the Midway Geyser Basin. The parking lot here is pretty small, and gets very congested. We arrived around 9:30, and chose to just park on the road. The only facilities available are a few pit toilets, no water station. The boardwalk was a nice, easy loop. You can see Grand Prismatic from the ground level. The crowds can get large.    After you see it from the ground level, move your car to the Fairy Falls trail head, it is the next stop on the road. We were able to move our car to this lot. No facilities available here. It is a flat hike to the trail head. Make sure you take the trail to the left, marked ""trail."" It does not say this is the way to the overlook. There is a bit of a climb here, but the observation area is certainly worth it!    We did not continue to the Falls. It was getting hot, and the kids were getting crabby. The trail was really dusty and gravelly, I had my Chaco sandals on but would have preferred my gym shoes for this one."
500,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Danville, CA, ",Unbelievably Colorful,The Grand Prismatic Spring was the highlight of our visit to Yellowstone. It can get crowded and parking maybe a challenge. But it's worth a stop. There is a lot of thermal activity near the spring. The spring itself is huge. And the rainbow colors are very vivid.
501,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Brownsville, WI ",Was so amazing,This was an amazing see. It is so big to walk around. We had a windy day so the steam was coming at us. Like taking a steam bath. The colors you can't capture on film it is remarkable. The steam even has different colors. This is a must in Yellowstone. Just hold on to any hats you have.
502,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Palmetto Bay, FL ",One of my favorites!,This was by far one of my favorites! The colors are amazing and it makes you appreciate the wonder that it is!
503,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"San Francisco, CA ",Gorgeous! Must See!,It is one of the most beautiful features of the Yellowstone National Park. You do not need to go with a tour - you can drive down yourself.  The stop for the spring itself is extremely crowded with cars lined up both sides to get in to the parking. Avoid this if you can. You'll anyway not get a good view of the spring from ground level.  Instead STOP AT FAIRY FALLS (one stop before the Grand Prismatic Spring). You will need to walk 15-20 mins (depending upon your fitness level) up the trail (the trail climbs only for 5-10 mins odd rest of the road is flat). There is a platform built to view the spring from there. It is gorgeous. Also not too many people climb here at one time so it isn't very crowded on the platform. Best place to get an almost aerial view of the spring...it is so worth the walk in the hot sun :)
504,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Shelby Township, MI ",Beautiful view from the top,"It is hard to appreciate at ground level, but from the top it is possible to appreciate what a spectacular feature this is.  Pictures are awesome at this site. You may see many in pictures in books, but they do not compare with seeing it yourself from the trail that leads above the spring. It is an amazing bit of nature that will make more in awe of Yellowstone and the beautiful treasures there. This is one of those treasures that you should not miss."
505,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Ogden, UT ",quick trip,This is probably the most beautiful thermal pool in the park. It requires some walking and is frequently windy. I have never done it but you can park about 1/2 mile South of the feature and hike to a higher point and overlook the pool.
506,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Hixson, TN ",Absolutely beautiful!,"We had seen several other thermal features before making it to this one and we were glad that we had saved this one for the last. It was massive! Parking is limited so we had to park along the road and walk a ways. There is a good amount of walking to do at the site along with some stairs. Worth every step. The magnitude and beauty were unmatched. If you only see one in the park, make sure it is this one."
507,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Solo, ,Grand Prismatic Spring,Was my favorite spring at Yellowstone. My favorite images were from this location. I have a timelapse of this one.
508,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Johnston, IA ",Beautiful colors,It's difficult to get a good view of this from the boardwalk at Midway Geyser Basin. Go to the Fairy Falls trailhead south of Midway and hike to the overlook for Grand Prismatic.
509,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family, ,Great place in National Park,"Parking is to small, you will probably have to wait for entry. Views and colors are fantastic!!! This place is amaizing and unique"
510,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,Israel ,fantastic,Better view is from the opposite hill and better in midday then the sun sunshine direct to the pool and less vapor from the pool
511,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Bay City, OR ",Gorgeous place to visit,"Parking it's a little crazy. The best time to go its after late morning, because if it's cold and with the steam you won't see anything.  This place its amaizing, unique and unforgettable ♡ sad that some people they don't respect and are hurting what time (years of growing) and nature is giving to us. The elk foot prints was great to see in the nacteria but people writing their names it's unacceptable.  Tjis place it's a MUST GO, you cam enjoy the trails around."
512,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,Sexsmith ,"Beautiful spot, but...","The grand prismatic spring was very interesting, what we could see of it, but there really needs to be an elevated walkway, or something of the sort, so that one can actually see the beautiful colors of the spring. From the walkway, you can see the outer orange edge, and a hint of green and blue, because you are actually even with the spring."
513,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Lexington, KY ",wait for the rain to pass,"When we arrived a storm was brewing...we waited it out in the car and then had more space on the boardwalk. We did not take the time to hike to the overlook, but we will next time for sure. The river that runs by this spring is a great place for family photos too!"
514,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Libby, MT ",To each his own.........,"The springs look just like the traveler's photos here. I particularly didn't think it was worth fighting through all of the folks taking photos, nor trying to find a small space just to park a motorcycle."
515,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Grand Junction, CO ",Easy walk!,My 80 year old mother was able to do this hike and enjoyed the beautiful colors and gushing hot water!
516,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Jenks, OK ",Gorgeous,This pool is amazing and worth the walk to see it. The colors are hard to believe. Sadly you cannot see it as well from the walkway as you see in photos taken from the cliffs or the air.
517,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Sacramento, CA ",Highlight of our trip!,"This was a highlight of our trip to Yellowstone. There are lots of different hot springs to see in YNP, but the colors here are what make it a standout! Like other reviewers have said, you have to visit early or late in the day or expect it to be crazy busy in the summer months. We visited in July. The parking lot fills up and you have to park along the road and walk a ways to get to the boardwalk. Once it's busy trying to navigate along the boardwalk can be tricky as not everyone follows the same stay to the right concept. The path isn't long so not a big hike to undertake. Definitely a must see but I can't stress enough to go early or late or be prepared to deal with crazy crowds. Also, for an even more beautiful view take the fairy falls trail and hike up to the overlook and view Grand Prismatic from above. It's only about a mile round trip and worth every step. A highlight for sure!!!"
518,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Pleasant Prairie, WI ",Go to the Overlook!,Park at the trailhead for Fairy Falls and walk to the overlook of Grand Prismatic. Worth the short hike - amazing colors.
519,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Hastings, MI ",Astounding,"Such a beautiful place. Traffic is heavy in July but it's a must see and is worth the wait. When photographing, hold your camera high and then even with the springs. You'll get the best photos that way."
520,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018,not available,"Novato, CA ",Busy but a must-see,"Like with many things at Yellowstone (especially during the summer) try to arrive early or late to beat the crowds. Definitely take the fairy falls trail towards the overlook for the best panoramic views as well...this place is popular for a reason, as it’s one of the most unique and spectacular places you’ll find in Yellowstone or Anywhere else for that matter."
521,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Albrightsville, PA ",A must see,"The spring was a “must see” for me. I wasn’t disappointed! Truly magnificent.    Parking is an absolute nightmare. Took over 1 hour to just get in the lot. The second lot to get up to the viewing deck wasn’t any better. I know summer is peak season so I dealt with it.    This stop requires a bit of walking and a little hiking, especially if you go to the viewing deck. Which, I recommend. The view is amazing.    Wear comfortable shoes and bring water."
522,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Cecil, WI ",BEAUTIFUL!,"There were lots of people here including several tour buses but it was so worth it. We had a picnic along the shore of the river below the Grand Prismatic Spring. Parking here was kind of a pain but if you wait 20 minutes you will get a spot in the lot instead of the road (which is what a lot of people do). There are bathrooms by the parking lot. You walk over the bridge and up a hill to the springs. Walk along the board walks that are over the bacteria mats. There is lots of interesting information on the plaques around the boardwalks. The Grand Prismatic is more grand the less clouds there are in the sky, we were lucky to go on a super sunny day which I would definitely recommend."
523,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Winston Salem, NC ","After you see this, go to the overlook on Fairy Falls trail","This is a must see, but at eye level from the boardwalk, you can only see so much. After seeing it up close, drive a little further south and stop at the Fairy Falls trail. Part way to the falls, they have an overlook that let's you look down on Grand Prismatic. From here you can see the full spring and all of the glorious colors. If you only have time to do one, I would see it from the trail overlook. It is spectacular!"
524,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Silver Spring, MD ",Parking is awful but springs are beautiful,Parking is bad - so just plan on that. I wish the parks had more money to better effectively manage the lots. You can park on the road and walk in too. It’s a beautiful place - the largest springs in the park. They are quite steamy so we didn’t get a clear view of them.
525,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Edinburgh, UK ",Awesome,"The colours here as so amazing and just not worth missing  Get here as early as you can as parking is limited, although there is car park so we’re parking on the road leading up to it.  Beware, on the day we visited there was only one toilet and 2 coaches pulled up and were using the facilities at the same time.  Once parked it is about a 15 walk up to the spring. There are several here and you follow the boardwalk over the river and then up 2 slopes to the lakes. You can follow a path round on the boardwalks and there are plenty of warning signs telling you not ta walk on the ground as danger of burns. The colours of the lakes are just amazing and I’ve not seen anything like this anywhere before. Allow an hour here to visit and take photos.  If travelling in from the west and you drive past the parking from the lake about 3 minutes past is another geyser with parking and then a longer walk. As this is the other side of the river you can follow it along and end up higher over looking the grand lake. However it is much longer walk, easily half a mile"
526,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"American Fork, UT ",Surreal experience,"This is our favorite stop in Yellowstone. The colors, textures, steam...so fascinating. Most of the stock photos you see of Grand Prismatic Spring are aerial, so if you want to get a view from above, you can take the Fairy Falls Trail to an observation area. I prefer to walk along the boardwalks to see it up close and personal."
527,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Seattle, WA ",One of the top places to see,"This place is always packed, and most people see it at eye level, The best way is to go to Fairy Falls, take a half mile hike to a overlook where you will see prismatic's real beauty"
528,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Fountain Valley, CA ",Incredible natural pool,"Breathtaking natural pool. All the colors of the rainbow. Key is to park at the Fairy Falls parking lot. Short hike, at the fork take the high road for a great view from above the pool. Path takes you back to the main."
529,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Leuven, Belgium ",This is must see!,"Dont' go Yellowstone without visiting this spring, but do it properly, that is, make sure to go the viewing point on the side (you need to pass the parking at the spring itself and continue the drive till the next parking on your right. You need to walk (one-way) about halve a mile till you see a path going up on your left. The viewpoint at the top provides the view as you see in the books. Simply wonderful, with an incredible variety of colors. The smoke makes it even more a magic place. You should obviously go to the spring itself and have a look, but there you don't get the full view. It is however cool to see how the smoke above the spring mirrors the colours underneath."
530,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Cincinnati, OH ",Parking is difficult,We visited mid afternoon and parking was a challenge. After trying to get in the lot we parked on the side of the road and hiked in. The grand prisim is amazing but the crowd can be a challenge
531,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Starkville, MS ",Exceptional,"If anything I enjoyed this even more than Old Faithful. Coloration is extraordinary, and the different viewing angles really enhance the experience."
532,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Metamora, MI ",We picked a bad day to see - fog.,"Unfortunately when we got there the fog had set in. And it didn't lift. We couldn't see the other side of the basin it was so bad. And be aware there are no guard rails on much of the walkway. So wheelchair access is allowed, but not easy when its packed with people - and that's most of the time. We talked to a couple who had seen the spring on a good day, and they said it was fantastic."
533,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"London, UK ",A wonderful place (from two viewpoints),View from close up at dawn/dusk to see the steam rising OR view from the overlook on a sunny day to see the magnificent contrast to the surrounding area.    Superb!
534,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Monifieth, UK ",Magnificently beautiful,"We did the walk from the Fairy Falls car park trail to the overlook in late June (22nd), it's about 3/4 of a mile with the last 400 yards climbing to the overlook.    We had to wait a little while to get a parking space, the only time we waited to park in our two weeks in the Yellowstone area, but after about quarter of an hour a family got in their car and pulled away – we were in.    The walk to the falls was nice – there’s a couple of thermal pools next to the path, one with a deep blue colour, and ahead of us through the steam we could see the surface of the earth turning blue, we were going in the right direction – it was a little steep as we hiked up to the overlook but nothing too strenuous – and the view from the top – Wow.    The sun was out and the colours of Grand Prismatic were unbelievably vivid – probably the most remarkable sight I’ve ever seen in my life and that’s after knowing in advance what it would look like.    We spent a fair bit of time gazing on the Grand Prismatic’s wonders and taking lots of photographs, none of which do it justice. I’ll definitely go back to see it again at some point in the future – it’s magnificent."
535,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Albany, OR ",Vacation,"Too beautiful to put into words. No picture does this place any justice. If you go to Yellowstone, this is a must."
536,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Portland, OR ",Must view from the overlook!,"Grand Prismatic is SO beautiful. Do yourself a favor though and park at the Fairy Falls parking lot and walk the path up to the overlook. Grand Prismatic must be seen from above to truly be appreciated, IMHO. The walk is maybe a mile round trip? We had our 6 and 9yr old with us and they did just fine. Enjoy!"
537,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Westfield, IN ",Beautiful!,"I wish we had taken the hike up to the observation point for the aerial type view but even from the ground it was amazing! The Midway Geyser Basin has very limited parking and it is nearly impossible to get a spot most of the day. We lucked out and got one in the lot around 10am, but if I were going again I would aim for earlier than that or in the evening. (After 5/6pm it seemed almost all crowded parking lots were virtually empty and you could have boardwalks almost to yourself...even in July!)."
538,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Friends,daytona beach ,"Yes, it is impressive.","No matter what pictures in national geographic you've seen, it's still impressive and worth it. I enjoyed it more than old faithful...    The hike on the board is great.  The hike in the woods on the opposite side is better though it requires a little climbing - you can do this ;)    No, don't put fingers in it!"
539,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Wellesley, MA ",A Yellowstone Standout!,"What makes the Grand Prismatic Spring so spectacular is it's size - it's huge - and the colors are amazing. Adjacent to the Spring is a sister pool, the Excelsior Geyser Crate, which is lesser known, but equally spectacular in color and depth. An easy, relatively short walk around from the parking lot make this site a ""must see"" for everyone!!"
540,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Tampa, FL ",My 2 cents on seeing this beautiful spring.,"WE got there early and scored a good parking space. BUT, it is cool in the morning and the steam from the spring obstructed the view. Plus you cannot appreciate it up close anyway. We left and later hiked up to the observation over the spring around mid day. Big difference!"
541,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Saint Louis, MO ",Most crowded- plan ahead,this was the most crowded site we visited over a 3 day period. We opted to park on the street before the main entrance and took a 5-7 minute walk on a path. Go before 10 or after 6 for less people traffic.
542,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Belchertown, MA ",Surreal beauty,"We stopped at Midway Geyser Basin early in the day to beat the crowds but the cooler air was filled with the steam of the hot pools. You can't get a good view of Grand Prismatic Spring from the boardwalk here because it's level with the ground. Instead, park at the Fairy Falls trailhead and walk about 1/2 mile up the trail. You can take a detour to the left, up the hill, to a lookout that will give you a birds-eye view. Return to the parking lot or continue along the trail to pretty Fairy Falls."
543,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Little Canada, MN ",Beautiful...,Outside of Lamar Valley this was my favorite spot in the park. The rainbow of colors in the myst coming off the spring was amazing. The spring itself also is cystal clear with brilliant blues and oranges.

545,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples, ,Breathtaking....,"This was well worth the short wait for a parking space when we were at Yellowstone in mid-July. Probably the best part of the park (but we only did the lower loop). If you’re going to tour Yellowstone on your own like we did, leave early - like 6 AM - to have fewer crowds and shorter wait times."
546,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"New York City, NY ",Colorful,"The parking lot was full and overflowing so we parked near the turnout to the parking lot. It is a popular attraction, so it is crowded, but it is worth it all to see the beautiful colorful formation of Grand Prismatic Spring. For a even better perspective, we walked the overview off of the Fairy Falls Trail."
547,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Houston, TX, ",The colors are amazing!,"This is one of the most beautiful sights in Yellowstone. The colors are so beautiful, and it was enjoyable to walk around it and view it from various angles."
548,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Manitoba, Canada ",Beautiful,The Grand Prismatic was amazing. The view was excellent and it was very neat to see. The boardwalk should have had guard rails though due to the amount of tourist on the boardwalk at once.
549,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",Green/blue steam - a must see!,"Well worth the effort to go but given the summer traffic, plan for before 9:30ish in the morning and well after 6pm. Parking lots fill quickly and become quite difficult to traverse. We didn't do it, but while the spring is beautiful on the boardwalk, I'm told that the best view is the hike that goes above and behind it."
550,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Austin, TX ",Most magical and one of favorite place,"It’s so magical, beautiful and one of my favorite place in Yellowstone. Don’t miss it. A must. We went to the outlook first and then drove to the take a closer look. The color, the formation, words just cannot explain it. You just have to experience it. According to the ranger, the color around the pool changed according to the weather and temperature of the atmosphere. It’s brown and green now but it’s turquoise last August which she had never seen before. Go and enjoy it."
551,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,Stamford ,Interesting to see but terrible parking,I think I would have liked this more if we didn't wait more than an hour for parking. There was a bison jam just before the turnoff so we waited forever. I wish we had done the overlook instead.
552,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Tuckerton, NJ ",what is going on?!,"These things have me in awe! Just amazing, beautiful, creations of our Master! Best when seen with no clouds and less steam. Amazing when seen in person!"
553,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Gotha, Florida, ",Use the trail from Fairy Falls parking lot for the overlook to the Grand Prismatic Spring,"As impressive as the geysers are this is a must see spot in Yellowstone as well. Unfortunately the parking area is small and with busses and RV's trying to navigate it too, it doesn't help when people park along the sides of the entrance. Please be mindful of where you leave your car so as not to tie up traffic.    There is a slow climb to the area but it is up a paved/boardwalk path. You can see the boiling water running off into the firehole river. Excelsior Geyser Crater is first and beautiful and blue boiling water.    Then you turn the corner and there it is...Grand Prismatic Spring! The colors are stunning and even though you are level with the spring you can still see the contrast of colors amidst the steam. There are also animal tracks in the shallow water surrounding the boardwalk.    As we were looking at the springs we noticed an observation area behind that was elevated. You could not access it from the spring itself but we followed the flow of people and found where the trailhead was. That was our next destination. As impressive as it was to be next to the springs I wanted to see it from above! We drove back to the parking lot for Fairy Falls and found the path up to the overlook. It was so much more impressive from above. Definitely worth the 20 min hike to the viewpoint."
554,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Grand Forks, ND ","Beautiful, but make sure you have a tight grip on your kids","This hot spring was stunning! Keep in mind, however, you will be observing it from an approximately 5 foot wide boardwalk crowded with people. My 11 month old was strapped to me in a baby wrap, my 2 year old was in a stroller, and my 4 year old walked VERY closely to us and held one of our hands as I didn't want him to get bumped and fall into the boiling water just below us. This is worth your time for a stop, but pkease be cautious especially if you have younger children."
555,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Fayetteville, NC ",This is THE picture,This spring is the one most often seen in pictures involving Yellowstone. To get the best view it is a short but steep walk up to the observation point. It is worth the excursion.
556,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Leicester, UK ",One of the MUST SEEs,"After 2 Yellowstone visits I still haven’t managed to find time view the spring from the overlook but it’s on the list for the next visit. For the 1 mile walk to the overlook viewpoint, park at the Fairy Falls trailhead carpark. The boardwalk shouldn’t be missed as there are other beautiful pools & springs to view. It’s quite exposed on the boardwalk & can be quite windy so hold onto hats. The evidence of many lost hats can be seen in the springs & they will damage thousands of years of evolution. It is up to Mother Nature whether you get a good view of Grand Prismatic Spring. We had an excellent view during our last visit but not so good this time because of the steam. That said I refuse to down-rate a geological wonder because the conditions aren’t perfect at the time I choose to view it. That’s akin to rating a geyser 1 star because it doesn’t erupt for my pleasure."
557,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Yorktown, VA ",Stunning,"A good time to go is early in the AM before 9 or in the evening after 6 because the parking lot is so jam packed during the other part of the day that people have to park along the side of the road a ways down and walk back to the spring. This stop is probably the most impressive as far as colors and beauty amongst the geysers/springs available. Strangely enough, the colors seem to come out even better through photos. Wish I’d taken more when I was there."
558,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Peoria, AZ ",Early morning issues,"In an attempt to get to old faithful ahead of the crowds, we came in from West Yellowstone early and arrived here early. I blame the early morning (900 am) for less than pretty views. Or maybe the best views only come from up high. Either way, too much steam to see the different colors, so it was kind of a let down. Some of the nearby pools were gorgeous though, and definitely worth a stop to try your luck at the beauty!"
559,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Mission Viejo, CA ",Would be 5 stars if you could actually see it,"There are two locations from which to see this thermal feature (that’s what the rangers and guides call the exhibits in the park) – from an overlook or at its level from the boardwalk. Both offer different results. We did the overlook first, which is a 1 mile hike from the Fairy Falls parking lot. We were there early (before 7:30 am) and the fog was still lifting. In the 20 minutes we stayed the fog began to lift and you could actually make out the springs. At the time we arrived, we had no idea where it was. Even with the fog lifting there is still some serious steam coming off of it, so I’m guessing that the conditions have to be perfect to get those amazing pictures. From the boardwalk there are more colors to be seen, but most of them are the oranges at the fringes caused by the thermophiles, primarily because the outer edges are closer to the boardwalk and therefore easier to see. I’m guessing that if you go in the afternoon when the conditions are better, the parking situation is unbearable and then you have that issue to deal with. Pick your poison."

563,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,Roxbury NJ  ,Mesmerizing,"The problem with viewing it is you must get there early, but you cant see much till the early cold temperture rises so the steam doesn't obstruct the view....you are damned either way...best viewed by the trail view up the hill that takes you to Fairy Falls...spectacular view....crowds were a bit maddening"
564,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Southampton, UK ",Spectacular but go to the overlook viewpoint.,"No need to say more about this wonder of nature other than to recommend that you do not go round the boardwalks of the spring itself but go to the Fairy Falls parking and walk that trail about a mile, fork left up the hill to the viewpoint / overlook for the best overall view."
565,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family, ,Gorgeous,Must see. Be ready to enjoy a nice walk and see it both up close and from afar. Be sure to bring something to take photos! It’s incredibly colorful just like you see in the photo books or post cards.
566,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Mission Viejo, CA ",Beautiful!,"The best time to see this is late morning. We came early in the morning to beat the crowds and tour buses, but you really can't see the colors with the slight haze in the morning. To get a great view, a ranger said to park in Fairy Falls and hike about 1.25 miles to the top and look down. What you see in postcards, etc., is taken from that vantage point. When at the spring, you can see those hikers making their way up Fairy Falls."
567,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Calgary, Canada ",A hot spring with spectacular views and colours,"We arrived here on the last day of our 3 day trip to Yellowstone National Park. It was worth the visit. We parked at the Midway Geyser Basin lot and walked to view the Grand Prismatic spring. This was the only spot in the park where we struggled to get parking, cars were queued to get into the parking lot.  There are several hot springs and geysers in the midway geyser basin area which look good but Grand Prismatic spring is super-special with it’s array of colours.  The walk to the hot spring was mostly at a plain level through board walks. There was a lot of steam from the spring that prevents you from seeing clearly. The odor was distracting at times but the colours of the hot spring simply blew our minds away. Great for pictures too!  We later came to know of the overlook. The view from the overlook is spectacular I heard.  Be careful if you are wearing hats, it can get windy and blow the hat away. We counted many that were blown away and lying around the springs."
568,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Minneapolis, MN ",My favorite,The colors are amazing. Go early to beat the rush. The colors are due to a class of bacteria known as thermophiles that live in extreme temperatures.
569,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Morganville, NJ ",Full of colors,"This is an amazing spring in Midway Geyser Basin near Old Faithful inn. One would need to drive from the inn. Parking is busy on season but patience pays. If possible, one should take the Fairy Falls Trail to see the spring from top of a hill. This way you can see the spring completely. Different colors - red, blue, yellow etc."
570,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Saint Clairsville, OH ",My favorite!,"Of all the springs we saw this was my favorite! I didn’t know there was an upper trail or I would have taken that! There were a lot of people and parking was difficult, but it was well worth it! The colors are just stunning! Hold your hat or take it off...wind can be brutal!"
571,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Miami, FL ",Good to ser,"We have walk up to the lookout and did enjoy the view and the photo opportunity. Even the kids. Up close was nice too, although you do not see it as well because of the steam."
572,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Denver, Colorado ",Amazing colors,"We have been coming to Yellowstone since 1972 and this was the first time we hiked the Grand Prismatic trail (part of Fairy Falls Trail) so that we could see the spring from above at the overlook (opened in 2017). It was fabulous to see it at that height!!! The hike is 1.4 round trip, easy to walk (goes up hill at the end) and is well worth the time. Recommend you hike early morning (before 9) or evening (after 6) to avoid crowds."
573,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Barre, VT ",Go early and go to the overlook,"We bypassed Grand Prismatic Spring one day during the height of the day because the parking was backed up tremendously and people were everywhere. We came back the next day around 7:45 am and parked in the first row.    The downside of being there in the am, particularly if it is cool/cold out, is that there is so much steam and vapor rising from the springs that you can't really see as much as you'd like. It is still an interesting attraction, but I suggest doing the short hike to the overlook where you can get a view of the whole spring basin with all of the colors and shapes. We didn't hit the overlook, but all of the folks we talked to who did found it to make the experience much better."
574,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Rudolph, WI ",Must see,My favorite thing to see in Yellowstone were the geysers and hot springs. We stopped at almost every one of them. Each area is a little different. This is my favorite by far. Here you have such beautiful colors from the different bacteria that lives in these hot springs. Make sure you hold onto your hat. So many are found in the ponds from the wind. Not good. Take your time and enjoy.
575,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Washington, UT ",Have to see,Don’t go on a cold day or there will be so much steam that you won’t be able to see it. The best way to see it is to start hiking the Fairy Falls trail and go up the hill for a fantastic view.
576,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family, ,Wow!,"This was well worth the hunt for parking. As it was peak summer season, the lot was full with waiting vehicles. We opted to park on the roadside a little south of the lot. There’s a very short steep trail down to the river and then a nice walking path to get to the attraction (probably took us 5 minutes to get there, so don’t be afraid to park on the road). The spring was beautiful, but lots of crowds- hold on to small children because the boardwalks are narrow. The total loop is 0.5 miles. This spot is not to be missed at Yellowstone."
577,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family, ,Phenomenal,"It makes it more mysterious is, you are greeted with warm mist, passed through that mist is one of God's amazing work! no wonder this is one of the most photographed thermal feature and the country's biggest hot spring. Good job, Sir! We wished to see more of Your Astonishing Creations ever made!!!  Passed through the bridge, curious how hot the water flowing from the spring; its warm, just right! that time the weather is cool we felt liked we want to dive in to refreshed lol,"

579,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018,not available,"Porter, IN ",It is beautiful,"depending on time, I think you should do the hike of 2 or so miles for observation point. The hike in it is amayzing i can only imGine the beauty from the observation point."
580,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Long Beach, CA, ",Photographers take the fairy falls exit,Frankly if you are a photographer the best shot comes from taking the fairy falls parking and hiking up an incline to an observation post that overlooks the spring.
581,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Tucson, AZ ",Worth the hike in!,We had to park a way out but the walk in (about a mile) was worth it when we saw the springs. Stick around and be patient as when clouds come by and from different angles the colors change!
582,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Newnan, GA, ",Wow! Worth the half mile walk,"I'd been to Yellowstone a few times but this was my first to this spot. You walk along a gravel road and then head up a path( less than 400m) to get to the over view area. It was extremely pretty. i think it was my favorite pool in the park.  Apparently you can get to it from a lower parking area, but I am sure the ""overview"" from the top is much prettier.  The colors along with the steam and blue sky really made it a special scene to see. I highly recommend the stop."
583,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"horsham, ",No 1 for me,THE most spectacular feature at Yellowstone in my opinion. The best view is from the hill overlooking the spring. This is accessed from a a small car park about 1.5 miles south of the main car park. A walk of about 1.5 miles partly uphill to this overlook. A bright sunny day reflects the bright colours of the pool.  The main spring entrance provides a circular boardwalk and a close up view. A must see.
584,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Fishers, IN ","The most incredible place on earth, unreal","The Grand Prismatic looks unreal, like something out of a digital movie. This was our number one favorite place in all of Yellowstone. This is a very popular spot and can get crowded. We would suggest coming early in the morning. Make this a must see! You have never seen vivid colors and geological features like this...not even in other park basins. Even better, learn why these features give us such color and how that indicates the water temperature."
585,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Edmonton, Canada ",Most dramatic in the Park,Don't miss this stop in your tour of the park. Such vivid colours and on such a large scale. Be prepared for crowds though. And hang on to your hat. Lots are lost into the hot springs!

589,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family, ,Total Yellowstone,"Old Faithful is the most famous, but Grand Prismatic and all other ""paint pots"" are the most spectacular. If you have limited time, skip OF (watch on webcam) and go to the Grand Prismatic spring and surrounding basin!"
590,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Seattle, WA ",Mother Nature !!,"Terribly crowded so I advise you to go somewhere before 9AM and after 7PM ( during summers) as you will have better lighting, less crowd( as many leave to go to campgrounds or west yellowstone lodges) and less heat from the springs. Its such a beautiful sight with all these colours from the spring and the ecosystem that survives within it."
591,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family, ,Very very cool,"This was a very cool location for the kiddos. The boiling hot water pouring into the river, the geyser crater, the bacteria mats...all were quite a sight!    We did not go to the overlook platform, but it was plenty cool staying below. If you have a hat HOLD ON to it! We counted a dozen that were blown into the various areas we passed."
592,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Waterloo, IA ",Really Grand!,"There are two ways to watch. One is near, another is far, but gives complete view. We took far view, loved the view! Walked about 1.5 miles. Must watch, if you have time at Yellowstone."

594,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Largo, FL ",Beautiful,We visited before 10am in the morning and it was crowded with lots of people. The wind was blowing so it was difficult to see the colors.  We returned in the evening and took the hike that takes you to the other side of the spring and that was a much better view. The trail has elevation gain but is worth it.
595,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Portland, OR ",So different!,"All these hot springs are unique and amazing. Just when I thought I had seen it all, we stopped at this one and I was again amazed at how unique these sites are. It was worth stopping for."
596,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Cincinnati, OH ",Spectacular,This is a must see!! We almost missed this because we were running low on time. I am glad we took the time to stop. It is amazing. If it is windy - do not wear a hat - you'll lose it and it litters the park. The ground is too thin to retrieve and its is a shame to see hats littering this beauty. Colors are amazing. Took some incredible artistic pictures and family shots.
597,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018,not available,"Novato, CA ",Unique colors,There are many thermal areas to see in Yellowstone but the colors at this one are unique and worth the stop.
598,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Branchville, NJ ",The Reason We Came,"This was the part of the park which I was most excited about. I couldn't wait to come and see, make sure you get there early because parking is a nightmare. The spring is vibrant and really the pictures don't do it justice. The size is way bigger than I anticipated. It's going to be crowed, so be prepared. I highly recommend doing the overlook to get the full effect of the pool. Really one of my favorite parts of the park."
599,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",Beautiful,"Took the Fairy Falls Trail to the overlook. It's a hike and for a pair of out-of-shape flatland Texans, the hike wasn't easy BUT the view of the Grand Prismatic Spring is spectacular!! Parking is difficult as everyone wants to see this sight. Be patient and plan ahead. It's a must-see, life event."
600,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018,not available,"San Francisco, CA ",Beautiful colors and view,You can view this geyser by walking near it or you can do a small hike which is around 20 mins from midway geyser basin. The view from top is worth the hike.
601,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Chagrin Falls, OH, ",Nature at it’s finest,"We parked at the Middle Geyser lot and walked to the Grand Prismatic overlook. The walk was level until the small uphill climb to the overlook, probably a mile and a half round trip. The view was absolutely amazing, such vivid colors. Loved seeing in person after seeing photos. The overlook is the best way to see the spring in my opinion. Aerial view beats up close but do both if you have time."
602,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,Illinois ,A Sight to See,We accidently hiked to the overlook to see Grand Prismatic Spring but was glad that we did. It had not been our intent--we were looking for something else. We had always wanted to see Grand Prismatic Spring but kept forgetting in past visits.
603,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Phoenix, AZ ",Nothing to see...,"While a slightly impressive walk to the spring, the steam and low level prevent you from seeing anything. If you're a photographer, you squeeze some nice shots, but not much to see. Instead, take the hike to the falls, you'll get a better view of the spring without the crowds."
604,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Blackshear, GA ","Pretty, but very strong odor","This is a very pretty part of Yellowstone! The colors are pristine and beautiful! The odor can be overwhelming, so just be prepared! You will get some great pics!"
605,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018,not available,"Starkville, MS ",It was everything I imagined it would be.,Most people visit Yellowstone to see Old Faithful but I’m not going to lie Grand Prismatic was what I wanted to see. She didn’t disappoint. I highly recommend going down the road just a little bit and taking the short hike up the mountain so you can see it from above. The colors are amazing and picture cannot do it justice.
606,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Gorgeous but never as good as the ariel view you see on postcards,"We have been here several times when it is too windy and cold to see the spring even when you are standing right next to it, but definitely go. You haven't seen Yellowstone until you have seen Grand Prismatic."
607,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Solo,"Earlysville, VA ",Worth the climb,"Don't bother with the photo below, take the climbing path to the left and you'll be glad you did. It's very beautiful."
608,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Uniontown, OH ","Try the new viewing deck, if it's open, to actually see the spring","Walking the boardwalk around the spring is cool, but it doesn't give you a great view at all. You really need to see this one from above. There appears to be a new viewing deck along the Fairy Falls trail, but it was closed due to bear activity when we were there. This is a must-see if in the area."
609,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Sacramento, CA ",Highlight of our trip!,"This was a highlight of our trip to Yellowstone. There are lots of different hot springs to see in YNP, but the colors here are what make it a standout! Like other reviewers have said, you have to visit early or late in the day or expect it to be crazy busy in the summer months. We visited in July. The parking lot fills up and you have to park along the road and walk a ways to get to the boardwalk. Once it's busy trying to navigate along the boardwalk can be tricky as not everyone follows the same stay to the right concept. The path isn't long so not a big hike to undertake. Definitely a must see but I can't stress enough to go early or late or be prepared to deal with crazy crowds. Also, for an even more beautiful view take the fairy falls trail and hike up to the overlook and view Grand Prismatic from above. It's only about a mile round trip and worth every step. A highlight for sure!!!"

615,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Albrightsville, PA ",A must see,"The spring was a “must see” for me. I wasn’t disappointed! Truly magnificent.    Parking is an absolute nightmare. Took over 1 hour to just get in the lot. The second lot to get up to the viewing deck wasn’t any better. I know summer is peak season so I dealt with it.    This stop requires a bit of walking and a little hiking, especially if you go to the viewing deck. Which, I recommend. The view is amazing.    Wear comfortable shoes and bring water."
616,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Cecil, WI ",BEAUTIFUL!,"There were lots of people here including several tour buses but it was so worth it. We had a picnic along the shore of the river below the Grand Prismatic Spring. Parking here was kind of a pain but if you wait 20 minutes you will get a spot in the lot instead of the road (which is what a lot of people do). There are bathrooms by the parking lot. You walk over the bridge and up a hill to the springs. Walk along the board walks that are over the bacteria mats. There is lots of interesting information on the plaques around the boardwalks. The Grand Prismatic is more grand the less clouds there are in the sky, we were lucky to go on a super sunny day which I would definitely recommend."
617,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2018 , Family,"Winston Salem, NC ","After you see this, go to the overlook on Fairy Falls trail","This is a must see, but at eye level from the boardwalk, you can only see so much. After seeing it up close, drive a little further south and stop at the Fairy Falls trail. Part way to the falls, they have an overlook that let's you look down on Grand Prismatic. From here you can see the full spring and all of the glorious colors. If you only have time to do one, I would see it from the trail overlook. It is spectacular!"
618,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2018 , Family,"Silver Spring, MD ",Parking is awful but springs are beautiful,Parking is bad - so just plan on that. I wish the parks had more money to better effectively manage the lots. You can park on the road and walk in too. It’s a beautiful place - the largest springs in the park.

Now, if only people would stop throwing their hats in it.","Grand Prismatic Spring is one of the iconic features of Yellowstone. The vivid colors are stunning. Steam rolls gently off the water, sometimes obscuring the surface of the spring. Yes, it smells like sulphur, but the amazing beauty of the feature makes you forget the smell. But this beauty is marred by the ball caps, sticks, and other objects people have thrown onto the nearby surfaces. Park rangers risk their lives to retrieve these articles. I wish travelers wouldn't spoil the scene for everyone else."
625,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Jacksonville, FL ",A Well-Deserved Favorite,"Not to be missed Grand Prismatic is especially spectacular both due to its lovely water color and to the thermophiles (heat-loving micro-organisms) that turn pool edges into various shades of orange, depending on just a few degrees of temperature differences."
626,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Long Beach, NY ",Grand Prismatic Spring,We visited this part of Yellowstone walking ton the deck built near the thermal springs.

A new overlook has been built to get a view of the spring from above which is much better than walking along the boardwalks next to the spring. To get to the overlook, you need to go south of the Midway Geyser Basin lot and park in the lot for Fairy Falls. You then hike a half mile or so down the Imperial Geyser Trail. You will come to a fork in the trail and need to hang a left up 400 yards to the overlook. As the new trail goes through the woods, I'd advise some insect spray.l"

634,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Los Angeles, CA, ",Nice to see You decide,Parking is tough. You can wait in the line which basically is just waiting for someone who has already experienced the spring to leave. We parked up on the street and walked in. Easy walk. Not far    The springs are pretty neat. We did not see a lot of colors. But it was still fun.    Stay on he boardwalk. The ground off the boardwalk may look stable. But it can also just be a thin crust covering boiling water and mud. Not fun and potentially very dangerous    It is steamy.    Bathrooms can be crowded. There is one set that has two stalls. That line moves the quickest
635,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Galena, OH ",Go on a hot day,"It was very cold on the day we went here, which makes for more steam. It was so steamy that we could barely see the hot spring. We went back the next day when it was warmer and had a much better view.

641,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Chardon, OH ",Highlight of our trip to yellowstone,Seeing this spring along with several others along the boardwalk was just amazing. Even better was the short hike at Fairy falls to see the Grand from up high in a completely different vantage point. Up high view is where the colors really show themselves. Not to be missed.
642,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Camdenton, Missouri ",Go to overlook!!!!,"If you dont go to the overlook you are wasting your time!! Park up the road just a ways and hike the trail to the overlook. It is an epic view you wont see from the boardwalk. The hike is slightly strenuous but I followed an elderly couple up it. It is mostly level and then a 400 yard path up to overlook deck. Go to the overlook!!! Go early in the day or early evening to avoid the crowds, the day we went we found the overlook to be less crowded."
643,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jul 2017 , Family, ,Busy,"Place is very busy during the day. Avoid anytime from 11 am until maybe 3pm. Lots of busses, no place to park but along the road but otherwise nice"
644,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018,not available,"Keene, KY ",Amazing!!,"So lovely in every way! A “must see” while visiting the park! Was not overly crowded at all when we visited around 11am in June. Don’t miss the ariel views- after viewing, drive to the next parking lot “Fairy Falls” and follow the trail up the mountain to get views from the top!! It is a little steep for some, but worth the effort. People of a variety of ages and fitness levels made it to the top without a problem!"
645,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,Raleigh ,Beautiful,"The size can be appreciated by going to the entrance for it. However, parking is a challenge. I preferred the view from the lookout that can be accessed for the Fairy Falls hike. In any event, it is a sight to behold."
646,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Carthage, MO ",Colorful sight,Take the hike to the overlook to see the colors at their brightest. It's a bit steep but worth the time to get there.
647,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Columbus, OH ",Incredible Sight,You have to see this geyser on your trip. Just amazing sights and the colors are so pretty. You can walk up to the geyser on a boardwalk or take fairy falls trail to an overlook to view it from above. Highly recommended!
648,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Rialto, CA ",Amazing Sights,This attraction is great for the whole family. You do have to walk over a ramp to get to the springs. You have to cross a bridge so make sure wheelchairs can get up a small grade.    In cold temperatures there is much steam. I love that you have a few pools to see in that area. It was beautiful. A MUST SEE if you are in Yellowstone.
649,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Friends,"Baltimore, MD ",Dont Miss... the Beauty,"No words for the spring with its stunning colors along with its size ,feels like we are stepped in another world. Great place for Photography. Recommend to visit Fairy falls trail head to view the areal view of the spring. Too crowded and getting parking is the tough."
650,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Long Beach, CA ",Biggest one in Yellowstone,"The Grand Prismatic Spring is beautiful. It's a wonder to admire and also difficult to photograph given the ramp is not that much higher than the Spring. Soak it all in, read the boards, and be patient in the midst of hundreds of folks getting their picture taken"
651,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"McGuffey, OH ",Unique but busy,"We waited on the road for an hour. Unless drivers were held up by five bisson, the back up was for parking. Cars were stopped waiting for a vehicle to leave the small parking lot. Once inside the spring area, we were all blown away by the color of the water."
652,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Gorgeous!,Take the Fairy Falls trailhead to the overview of the spring to get the best view. Crowded but spectabular.
653,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Very impressive! Worth a visit even if crowded.,The Midway Geyser Basin has probably changed the least of all the sights we saw this trip compared to my last visit in 2005. But the parking situation must be improved; it was the worst of all our stops this trip probably partially due to being so close to the Old Faithful area. And it was by far the worst for people blocking the boardwalks with their selfie-picture taking and large group portraits.
654,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Solo,"Oakville, Canada ",Amazing geothermal site,"Busy parking lot, has pit toilets once you find them. Bus/RV parking sites. Stay on the boardwalks. On windy days expect to be enveloped by sauna like steam. You'll see the ponds up close but getting a good photographic viewpoint is not possible."
655,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Simi Valley, CA ",Other wordly,"Being here is like stepping onto another planet. This spring is spectacular in size snd color. It can get breezy here and if you lose your hat in the wind, you’ll likely not get it back. Great place for photography."
656,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Chicago, IL ",Never made it there due to traffic,"We wanted to go to Old Faithful and Grand Prismatic but were stuck in a traffic jam, likely to get to the parking, for almosr 2 hours! We gave up, turned around and went to Lamar Valley."
657,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Boston, MA ",Spectacular Thermal Attraction,"The largest of many beautiful colorful springs you will see in Yellowstone. A new boardwalk makes the viewing convenient. Very very small car park, so you may have to wait -- it is worth it. The colors are gorgeous."
658,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Family,"Richmond, Australia ",Pretty,Great bunch of colourful geysers for all to see. Follow the boardwalk and snap away. Plenty of car parking nearby. If you want the sensational view go one stop south and walk up to the lookout. It puts it all into perspective.
659,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Taylor, AZ ",Worth the hike to see this colorful sight,"Even in the rain, this spring stands out among all there is to see. There are two places to park so keep going if the first lot is full. You will need to be agile and have a camera, but it's a must!"
660,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Gold Coast, Australia, ",Colourful spot,"Take in the boardwalks and admire the vibrant colours, most spectacular in the Park. Go further down the road where you can then walk up to a viewing platform to get a birds eye view of the spring and all its colour. The day we were there bison were crossing over the spring, made for errie photos against all the steam"
661,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Middletown, NJ ",Read below before you judge!,"I am not giving the grand prismatic spring 1 star, I am giving the park system boardwalk setup 1 star. The spring really needs to be viewed from above to see all the amazing colors. After all, everyone wants to see the picture that’s advertised on all the brochures about one of Yellowstone’s greatest attractions, right? Well I was so excited and the parking lot is so tiny, so you have to wait online to get into it for a while. We went at 6pm and still had to wait. Then you get up there and bc the boardwalk isn’t raised at all, you basically see steam come off the spring and a little bit of rust color. If they made a viewing tower or a bridge out of the boardwalk everyone would be able to see this beauty. Skip this spot completely and hike up fairy falls trail to view."
662,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Pensacola, FL ",Amazing Colors!!!!,"Took our trip in early June, the place was crowded but definitely worth seeing. There were animal tracks in the sediment around the springs. The colors were so vibrant it was hard to believe that those types of colors could be found in nature."
663,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018,not available,"Homosassa, FL ",Beautiful,"Make sure you go to the overlook at the Fairy Falls trail head to see all of the colors, it is hard to get full perspective at the viewing area."
664,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Friends,"New York City, NY ",Enchanted,"Once I read an article in National Geolphraphic about Grand Prismatic Spring and since then I wanted to see this place. It was better than I imagine. Amazing. Beautiful. Just Enchanted. There is a board walk going around since it’s not allowed to step on the ground, I think one of the reasons are the spring’s sensitive microbes and hot temperature of the spring."
665,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Houston, TX ",Amazing nature,"All reviews summarize it as I would. Obviously beautiful place. The sky was lit on fire the first time we went in the evening.  Tips:make sure you accurately locate the prismatic spring OVERLOOK hike. Watching the spring up close, though surreal, is a pretty foggy experience."
666,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Friends,"Bellevue, WA, ",Best view is probably from high above,"This is one of those places where you know on first sight that the view from a few feet above would be much better than from the ground level but there is no way to get that view. The only vantage one has is from the ground level. Still this giant, colorful geyser won't fail to impress. There is expansive boardwalk covering this geyser and this, clubbed with Excelsior Geyser beside it, makes for a good amount of walking. Definitely worth the walk though, true to its name one can spot a vibrancy of colors on this geyser. The parking lot tends to get cramped as it is small. The geyser sits right beside a river and the short hike up the Grand Prismatic also makes for a lot of good photo opportunities."
667,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Chapel Hill, NC ",Beautiful but be prepared to hike!,"Lovely views and gorgeous springs, but be prepared to have elderly or children know that they will need to hike up many platforms to see the highest springs."
668,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018,not available,"Orangevale, CA ",Mesmerizing,"Steam evaporating from this spring is so soothing when it’s cold outside, but does have smell as all volcanic hot springs do. Beauty of colors & variations is so rich, that picture are simply poor vs what your eye can see."
669,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Birmingham, AL ",Best view is aerial,"The air temperature was about 63 and there was so much steam coming up from the hot spring that we couldn't really see it well. The grand prismatic spring is so big, the best view is really from the air. We bought a postcard of this spring, and actually enjoyed the other springs in this area more. They are SO colorful!"
670,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Cleveland, OH, ",My fave site at Yellowstone!!,Loved the Grand Prismatic spring and the hike to view the overlook. Truly incredible to see all the colors and how amazing this attraction was!
671,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Springfield, MO, ",Can get crowded,"Even in mid-May, when it often felt like we had the park to ourselves, this place felt busy. Lots of bus tourists. I wish they would do a raised platform above the Grand Prismatic Spring for a better view."
672,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Family,"Elkins Park, PA ",Best geothermal feature!,"The Grand Prismatic spring does not disappoint! It’s just beautiful, and part of the enjoyment is how the steam moves around revealing the spring gradually. The Fairy Falls trail was closed due to bear activity when we visited, and since that is supposed to be the best view we were afraid we wouldn’t get a good look. We were pleasantly surprised. Please note, there are no railings on the boardwalks in the geothermal areas so plan to keep an iron grip on your children!"
673,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples, ,"Oh, The Colors!",I do not believe I have ever seen such a diverse palette of colors as the Prismatic and features around it offer. Placing pictures here would not do them any justice. No camera can capture what a human eye can see and a human mind experience. Go and judge for yourself!
674,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Kimberling City, MO ",Top on my list,"For years, I dreamed of seeing this Spring and it did not disappoint. It is not in isolation, so there are several springs and geysers to see at this stop. Several tours were here as well and, at times it was difficult to even get into the parking lot, let alone walk on the boardwalk (even in May). Most everyone was respectful and accommodating to others."
675,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Family,"Kansas City, MO ",GO TO THE UPPER LOOKOUT,"To get the classic view of the grand prism, make sure you walk the trail on the mountain side behind it. Parking is a mad house so get there early. The warmer the day, the easier you will be able to see the prism because there will be less steam."
676,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Friends,"Massapequa, NY ",Absolutely gorgeous little walk,one of many beautiful stops along Trafalgar's National Parks Tour. enough time was allowed for a leisurely walk around the perimeter of this active geyser and springs area. Photos a must !!
677,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Family,"Saint Paul, MN ",Maybe not the Most Famous Geothermal Feature but it is the Best,"Grand Prismatic Spring has the most amazing colors. This is my favorite spot in Yellowstone. Any photographer will have a great time taking photos here. My top four geothermal sites in Yellowstone are the Grand Prismatic Spring, the Firehole River trail (starts at Old Faithful), Mammoth Hot Springs, and Fountain Paint Pot. If you are only going to stop at some of the geothermal sites then these are the must stop places."
678,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Family,"Franklin, TN ",Amazing colors straight from nature!,"We missed this on the end of a long day one, but our restaurant server suggested it so we stopped by first thing on day two. So glad that we did because it is an absolutely amazing example of the earth we live on. I had no idea that these brilliant colors could be formed by nature. Spectacular and not to be missed!"
679,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"New York City, NY ",Underwhelming in the morning,"This may be beautiful at other times, but when we went in the morning, steam was arising so we couldn't see the colors."
680,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Roanoke, VA, ",Spewing Steam and Sulphur,"We walked up the boardwalk to the top on a windy afternoon in May. Surprisingly, we encountered many others doing the same. Surprising, because we had encountered relatively few people all day at the other areas we visited. Here, the parking lot was at capacity and cars were parking along the road. Once at the lop we were impressed by this, the largest hot spring in the park. The large pool was steaming, and because of the wind, visitors were treated to zero visibility at times. Fun."
681,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Chattanooga, TN ",Amazing,"This place is otherworldly and beautiful. Gorgeous colors, interesting smells and hard to believe it is on this planet! The science alone is worth learning about. Pay attention to the posted signs! It can be a dangerous place it not treated with respect."
682,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Solo, ,Wow Effect!,You reach her and you get into wow effect mode :D and if its clear sunny day than you get to see better colors and effects all around you.this place gives a feel of different world .Enjoy the colors view and nature
683,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Oct 2017 , Family,"Jackson, WY, ",Awe inspiring,"You’ve seen the famous photos. Sadly, so many others have too and they all want to see this amazing site in person. This can make it quite challenging. I’m sorry to say but between new National Geographic features every year or two to an aerial image of it on bags from the Yellowstone Forever stores to publicity from the park itself and tourism advertisements, this feature, the third largest hot spring on earth, has been over publicized. With most advice, I say arrive in early or late season to enjoy this Wonderland and avoid literally thousands of people per day ahead of you, choking the inadequate access road, not to mention the parking lots. There are two by the way: one is the trail head for Fairy Falls, closed right now for bear activity, 1.6 km shy of the midway Geyser basin if you’re coming from Old Faithful. That’s where you park to see the higher view but the closer more oblique view, if you can get in, is from Midway. The problem with early and late season is cooler air temperatures cause much more vapor blocking your view of the astonishing colors. Last week, with gray skies and cold air, the parking lot was still full. So I recommend you come in mid June-mid August for the colors, but get there before 9:00 a.m. and wait for the sun to climb. Yes, it will take a chunk of your day. It is worth it. It is not a place to expect you can fit in along with all the other lower loop highlights unless you’re with someone who knows an additional strategy or two. Because, if you wait til later (who knows, this year even 9:00 might be too late) the access road will be completely jammed so you can’t get in. And, for a kilometer away coming from Old Faithful, you can’t park along the road nor even stop. Get past it and do a u-turn? Good luck with that. You’re not the first to have that idea. So, you may skip it, or get there very early. The demand far, far outstrips the supply of availability. Trying to see Yellowstone in one day may task all of your limits.  And I simply love this place, both vantage points. Extraordinary wonder here calls for extraordinary efforts. They will reward you."
684,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Family,Ohio ,Variety of many strange hydrothermal features in a relatively small area.,"This half mile walk on accessible boardwalk includes well written and well presented boards that describe the various features you are viewing. The variety of features helps you to make sense of some of these things throughout the park. It also makes it clear that, even though the humans are expected to stay off the fragile features, the wildlife doesn't seem to care because you can see animal prints in these areas."
685,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples, ,Colors!!,Well worth the stop to take the short walk and enjoy all the sites here! Such amazing colors and views.
686,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Apr 2018 , Solo, ,Difficult to see...,"It is for sure lovely, but you might not be able to sense it, partly due to steam, and partly due to its size so that you can not easily see the whole spring unless you get to the peak next to it..."
687,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Family,"New Bern, NC, ",Too much steam,We were disappointed to find too much steam over the spring to see the spectacular colors. We tried on two different days. We’ve been before when it was fully visible but wanted our son to see it this time. This is a crowded spot. Beware of tourists posing for Instagram photos on the boardwalk. They have little consideration for others at the sight and are a hazard to those who are navigating crowds on a narrow walkway through a dangerous and delicate area.
688,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Solo,"Evanston, IL ",Gorgeous,I came to see this from ground level and while it’s not the same at this level it’s really worth the time to visit. Don’t miss this one. I was so enchanted I spent an hour and a half here and then came back again. Nature at it’s finest!
689,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Sep 2017 , Solo,"Marianna, FL ",Beautiful,You have to do the hike to see the spring from the top. I'm terribly out of shape so it was hell but totally worth it!!! The lower path is wooden and I saw people with strollers and whatnot. Great views from both the top and ground level!
690,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,May 2018 , Couples,"Jupiter, FL, ",Beautiful Colors,Very easy walk on the boardwalk takes you to this Hot Spring. The colors did not disappoint. Great place to take photos.

Go for a walk and get up close to something that is so bizarre yet strikingly beautiful at the same time. Just absolute crazy vibrant colors in and around the areas of the springs. Please stay on the walkways though as we witnessed several Chinese tourists walking off the trails to get up and close photos. I don't think they understood they were on brittle crust, inches from being poached alive.  All in all, a truly amazing sight to behold..."
694,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2017 , Solo, ,Amazing place,Had a lot of fun visiting this place. It's like a rainbow geyser. Lovely place to visit while in Yellowstone national park
695,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2017 , Family, ,Cool,"Hot, very hot, and steamy, and stay on the path. The spring is so colorful and big and is totally worth it. Make sure you secure all your belongings because people can drop their things in there and never get it back. It's a bad idea to throw anything in there and is pretty stinky, but you should definitely go see it. There's nothing like it!"
696,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Feb 2018 , Couples,"Paris, France ",Try the walk to see it from above,Walking and gaining a bit of elevation will help better appreciate the colors of the geyser. However less colourful in the winter but still spectacular
697,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Mar 2018 , Couples, ,Misty in Winter,"There are plenty of other things to do here in Winter, but the Grand Prismatic hot spring is hiding in a lot of mist when it is Winter. Anyway, from the high lookout (5-10 minutes walking) you'll still see the colors in March."
698,Grand_Prismatic_Spring,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Oldbury, UK ",Incredible colours,Pictures of this spring don't really do it justice. The colours are so vibrant and the boardwalk lets you get right up close without the feeling of being cut off by fences. Just beware if it's busy. We were there in the days following the solar eclipse which I believe is the busiest the park has ever been. At times it felt more like downtown Manhattan with the number of people and the amount of traffic. This meant that the boardwalk was packed full and we had to keep our wits about us not to be accidentally knocked off the boadwalk by people understandably distracted by the incredible views.
