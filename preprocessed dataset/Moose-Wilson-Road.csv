0,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2021,not available,"Fredericksburg, VA ",Beautiful drive to see wildlife,We love this road because of it's beauty. The fact that you can often see moose or bears is a bonus. Narrow country road and lots of congestion when the animals are in view. So drive carefully!
1,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2021,not available, ,"Saw lots of wildlife, moose, black bear, cool road.","Was best road we took, saw moose black bear, pretty drive that takes you to Teton village. Better drive than most. People will stop in the middle of the road and block traffic if they see anything. I think people are so far removed from nature that it's a big deal to see a critter, saw lots of dumb stuff when people saw an animal. Boggles my mind, look take your photo and move on, ya know there are zoos to get that close up. The animals don't deserve this. I dont get it."
2,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2021,not available,"Dallas, TX ",Moose & Bears here!,"We had the best luck seeing wildlife on this road! It is very near the Visitor Center, so it is easy to find. We saw 2 Moose and a baby, a black bear with her 2 cubs and another black bear eating berries by the road. We went 3 different days during our trip and only saw the moose one of the days, so be patient! It was worth going a few different days."
3,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2021,not available,"Burnsville, MN ",Early evening we saw moose and beaver,"Go early evening or early morning for your best chance to see wildlife. We saw a moose and beaver. Even if you don't see animals, it is a very nice drive through woods and along the creek"
4,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2021,not available,"Birch Run, MI, ",Nice drive,"Its a pretty drive, off the beaten path in Grand Teton National park. We didn't actually see any moose there but it was still a nice drive."
5,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2021 , Solo,"Fountain, CO ",No moose sitings but still nice,Secluded area of Grand Teton. It's a nice place to get away from the crowds. I tried a couple times but no moose unfortunately. It's still worth going though. I did see elk and sandhill cranes along with some various ducks. I would have gone back more times if my stay was longer
6,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2021 , Family,"San Antonio, TX ","Bears and Moose and Elk, oh my!","We went down MW Rd mid-June, weekends at dusk and a sunrise. Don’t let the review scare you, yes - the road is narrow and on gravel in places but it’s easy to navigate. Since we went on weekend evenings traffic was light. We saw:  1 bear! 2 moose! 1 Elk! 1 beaver! 2 deer! 1 idiot stopping in a no parking, getting out of his car and walking toward the moose! We were hoping for a viewing of When Animals Attack, but where the guy survives and is just totally scared, but no.  Even our 17 and 20 year old girls enjoyed it."
7,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2021,not available,"Virginia Beach, VA, ",Moose are there to see !!,"You have to take this gravel road and fight other travelers, but we got lucky and saw the prettiest Moose ever. She was bathing in the lake and splashing the water all around her body. We followed her through the woods and then she fell down and took a nap. We got great pictures that we will post later."
8,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2021,not available,"Vallejo, CA, ","No Moose, but still","Took this drive all the way to Teton Village. Quite a drive on a narrow road, with a section of just gravel. Nice views but be careful of oncoming traffic."
9,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2020,not available,"Chicago, IL ",Good for Moose,Plenty of Moose and deer but many people and you can't stop or pull over on most of it. Nice drive good area for Moose.
10,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2020,not available, ,Moose are there but you have to get lucky to see them,"I'm torn here. We went several times during our trip at sunset and sunrise to try and see wildlife. This is a very narrow and rough dirt road, some of it is paved but not much. Only one day did we see a moose, and boy was he a big fella! What sucked was the some kind of park official, grumpy old guy wearing a ""wildlife management"" vest who literally yelled at us and other minivans packed with people who stopped to see the moose. We could barely see him through the HOARDS of people. I get it, there are signs everywhere saying dont stop, dont park along road, view wildlife from moving vehicle.. Forget it, if you're there at sunset and there is a moose up front, the ten cars in front of you will see it, good luck to everyone else stuck behind you. You have to get lucky here, the road is just too narrow for more than a few cars to see anything. We saw so many moose out near Antelope Flats, I'd recommend that over this."
11,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2020,not available, ,Off the beaten path / Well worth it,The Moose Wilson Road is hard to find and very narrow. Well worth the effort though as we saw a bear cub eating / playing all three times we drove on it this week. Beautiful vistas.

13,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2020,not available,"Caddo Mills, TX ",Saw Moose at the Large Pull Out,There is a wide pull out parking area that overlooks a marshy area. Both times we stopped there we saw moose though the first time had to walk down the trail and get in the bushes! Was well worth it!
14,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2020,not available,"Lakeside, CA ",You'd never guess what we saw near Moose Wilson Rd.,"Yep, Moose! We were told we just missed the mama bear and cubs. But we did get to see dozens of tourists scatter as they got too close to multiple moose and the moose were not happy."
15,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Greenville, SC ",Great place to find moose!,We road the Moose Wilson road twice and both times saw a cow and calf moose! Highly recommend this if you're interested in finding wildlife!
16,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Cincinnati, OH, ",Saw Moose,This is a narrow and rough road to Teton Village but it is full of nice views and scenery. We saw a moose in the water near the road. It is a good way to get from the park to Teton Village.
17,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2020 , Couples,"Georgetown, IN ",Living Large,"This is my favorite spot in the Tetons because of the vast array of wildlife. We saw otters, moose and Bears!"
18,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2020,not available,"Spokane, WA, ",Can I give this 10 Stars????,This road was so so cool to see Moose on. We drove this in the afternoon one day after reading about Moose sightings so thought we would go on our own safari. And we did not have to go far to see a bull moose in a pond enjoying his afternoon snack. We got to watch him for a few minutes before other cars came up behind us so we moved on as to let them enjoy the find as well. The road was narrow and didn't have any pull offs but I was thrilled to get to see one in all of the nature glory around. I might add to be considerate of others and share your time with others behind you that would like to enjoy the animals as well.
19,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2020,not available,Louisiana ,Moose are on this road!,A narrow road with very few pull overs to look for wildlife. We did see moose in the ponds twice as we drove this road -- it is a pretty drive but if you've seen moose elsewhere I would skip this road since it is not conducive to pulling over -- no shoulders to speak of.
20,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2020,not available,"York, ME, ",Great place to spot wildlife,"Winding along the base of the mountains between the Craig Thomas Discover & Visitor Center and the Granite Canyon Entrance Station, this scenic little road developed early in the valley's history. Lots of twists and turns. Because of the close proximity of habitat to the roadway and because of the slow driving speed required wildlife can often be seen up close. Best times for wildlife viewing are early morning and around dusk."
21,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2020,not available,"Columbus, OH ","Moose,Moose","We drove the road twice and saw 5 moose and several elk. We watched a cow moose and her calf from our car for 30 minutes, they were about 25 yards away in the field grazing without a care."
22,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2020,not available,"Cypress, CA ",Great moose viewing opportunities,"We saw a momma & a baby! Another day we saw a lone female. It's a pretty, short drive. Come early am or around 6:30pm for the best opportunity to see them."
23,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2020 , Family,"East Brunswick, NJ ","It's a dirt road in the forest, not a zoo","We read this to be a sure thing when it comes to wildlife sightings. Since then, i've tried to take this road every time we could. It grts bumpy some areas, but the scenery is worth every bump on the road. We had a moose cow cross the road at sunrise and couple of cows with babies down in the marshes (seen from the overlook). The area itself is beautiful enough to make.me wish that was my way to/from work daily. I had no issues finding a pull off to let those who are in a rush to pass by. Like someone else.on here said, some get lucky to see more, others don't. Good luck!"
24,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2020,not available,"Powder Springs, GA ",The Devils Road,"So, Google tricked me into taking this road. Just like my first marriage, started fine, then got worse, then went to heck mid way through.    The road starts paved and 2 lanes coming from the south. Then in devolves into a 1 and quarter lane dirt road with hoopdies and washboards. But does that stop people from parking on the 'side'? Nope. So you'll burn 10 extra minutes just trying maneuver.    The irony is that is only 10 minutes longer to go through the traffic Jackson. And that's a lot easier."
25,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2020,not available,"Pocatello, ID ",Yes - we saw a moose along the road.,Nice drive with less traffic than the main route. We drove south one evening during our stay and enjoyed the road less traveled. And got pics of a cow moose having dinner. Peaceful and quite.
26,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2020,not available, ,Meh,"I thought we might see more wildlife here, but there was nothing but more scruff. Yellowstone is your best bet to see moose. elk, etc."
27,Moose-Wilson-Road,May 2020,not available,"Canon City, United States ","Nice drive, plenty of opportunity to see wildlife.","This is a nice drive from Jackson Hole to Moose. There are plenty of opportunities to see wildlife. The road is narrow in places, so this is not the place to be in a hurry."
28,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019,not available,"Syracuse, NY ",Saw Mama and baby bear,Part of this road is a bit rugged. So glad we took the time to go here because a mama bear and baby were right by the side of the road up in a tree. Fortunately a ranger was there to keep us tourists far enough away from the bears! People still get out of their cars.....amazing!
29,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019,not available,"San Diego, CA ",Great little country road but needs more pull-outs to park cars,"This little road winds through a plains area and forest, alongside a river. I saw a black bear as well as a moose! However I was lucky that I found a place to park my car at a lookout because those pull-outs were few and far between. Rangers patrolling would not allow people to walk on the road so once you got out of your vehicle to take photos you had to stay near where you did park. There was one trail I saw along to top of the bluff above the river with a clear sign noting the dangers of hiking in bear territory, so I didn't venture down that path. I would give this a 5 rating for the scenery and possibility of viewing wildlife, but because of the inability to take a walk on the road I downgraded it to a 4."
30,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2019,not available,"Poughkeepsie, NY ",Perfect Drive,"Bears in the trees, moose in the marshes, bison in the fields... if you are looking to see wildlife in Wyoming, this is hard to beat. And the scenery is nothing less than awe-inspiring. Highly, highly recommend this drive."
31,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019 , Family,"Peoria, IL ","Bumpy, Not a Guarantee, but Worth It!!!","We drove Moose-Wilson Road three different times while in the Tetons. The first two times we saw nothing, but the third time was the charm! It was after sunset with just a little light left and there was a cow moose with two calves right along the side of the road! The calves look a little like donkeys. We saw them just a little bit past the main pull off area coming from the North in the marsh/stream on the left side of the road. My kids were thrilled, because they got car sick the two times prior. Yeah, this road gets very bumpy towards the Southern side where it is dirt. Glad we had a larger vehicle to go over those bumps! Hopefully the do some repair, but if you can get lucky enough to see a moose or a bear, it’s worth it!"
32,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019,not available,"Sydney, Australia ",Moose where?,Drove this road a few times and once stopped in the parking area for 2 hours waiting. No moose. Other reviewers have posted they've seen them but we didn't. Disappointed. Road is narrow but not that bad and easy enough to drive with a normal car. Maybe you'll get luckier than us.
33,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019 , Family, ,Ridiculously busy,"Road was bad, drivers couldn’t drive. Likely to get in a crash with an out of state tourist in a rental. Only plus is it is s good place to catch a glimpse of an animal. If the road is open and park employees don’t shoo you off before you can take a pucrure"
34,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019 , Couples, ,Tetons,This is a narrow road but this is the only place in the park where we saw a bear. In the morning there are lots of bears.
35,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2019 , Couples,"Indianapolis, IN, ",Beautiful drive,"We enjoyed our drive through this beautiful area. Sadly, we did not see any wildlife but the drive is certainly not one to be missed."
36,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Modesto, CA ",Scenic Road,The road had just open after being closed for 10 days because of grizzly activity.No luck seeing a grizzly but a black bear wondered by fairly close.  We didn’t see any other wildlife on this road.I was really hoping to see a moose but no luck.  This road was very busy considering we were there the end of September.I will try again next time to see a moose.It’s worth the drive.
37,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019 , Solo,"Mountain Green, UT ","Flat tire - stranded, cost hundreds.","I drove this wretched excuse for a road hoping to see wildlife but got a flat tire instead. Full of giant unavoidable bone-crunching holes and graced with signs saying not to park in case you do see any animals, this road was a disaster for me and my small car."
38,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019,not available,Lincoln ,Las Vegas Strip,R U kidding me! A great road but full of stupid tourist! It s like grow adults acting like they have never seen a 4 legged animal before.
39,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Tulsa, OK ",Wildlife viewing at its best,"Driving Moose - Wilson road rarely disappoints if you are looking for wildlife. Driving it early morning and around dusk are the best times. Elk, moose, deer, and black bears are seen on a regular basis. If you are in the area, don’t miss it."
40,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019 , Business,"Little Rock, AR ",BEAUTIFUL,"We love to travel this road. We didn't has as much luck with wildlife this year, but enjoyed the beauty nonetheless. We did see a moose and her baby, a couple of black bears and a grizzly this year. Just not close enough for good pictures."
41,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Boise, ID ",Road closed due to Bear Foraging,Road from Wilson into Teton Park to Moose is not driveable now because of preservation of bear habitat. Call the NP HQ to get current status if you want to travel this way.
42,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019,not available,"Bishops Stortford, UK ",An interesting drive,The road is mainly paved and no problem driving in a normal family car. Some of the stopping points have been closed off by the ponds near Moose. While we were in the park there was little to see but we were unable to do the drive a second time as bears had been spotted and the road was temporarily closed.
43,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019,not available,"Venice, FL ",Never know what critters you may find.,"We had seen almost all of the major large mammels we wanted to see while in Yellowstone NP with the exception of moose. We just got onto Moose Wilson Road when we saw folks pulled over to the side of the road. My husband pulled over at the parking lot area and I walked back to where folks were gathered only to find out that a cow moose and yearling had just gone into the woods. As with all animal sightings in the park, patience is a virtue, and within 20 minutes the cow and yearling were sighted in the woods and worked their way back down into the creek below us. I was able to go some excellent shots of both of them."
44,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Scottsdale, AZ ",Scenic drive,Great scenery but only 3/4ths of road is paved and it is very narrow in some areas and not many places to pull over. I have seen bears in the area as they enjoy the berries in then early summer.
45,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019,not available,"Austin, TX, ",OK I guess,I read all the reviews and worried about our rental car going down this road. It was a nonevent. Maybe it had just been graded but seemed fine. We didn't see anything and we drove it twice at dawn and dusk. We wouldn't have know about the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve without driving down this road. I found that very interesting. Not a must go if you are limited on time. We passed cars with no issue. It did seem faster to the Jackson Hole ski resort area. Glad we did it but I don't think it is a must do nor anything to worry about if you do decided to do it.
46,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019,not available,"Harrison, AR ",Worth the drive,"This is an easy drive from Jackson to Moose Wy with the opportunities to see wildlife. Unfortunately our timing (time of day and time of year ) was off and we didn't see much wildlife to brag about , but hopefully you will have better luck !"
47,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019,not available,Florida ,Never saw a moose,"We were recommended to take this road and we did before dusk. Unfortunately, other than a narrow, rutted road, we never saw a moose."
48,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Cromwell, OK ",Got to see our moose,"We spent 9 days in Yellowstone and GTNP. We saw lots of bison and elk. We were fortunate to see some eagles and wolves. But the moose was elusive..we had heard on the gypsy app about moose Wilson road, but had not taken that route. About day 7, my wife told (well asked) me to take the road. We were not disappointed....we not only saw a moose, but a calf too. Was an awesome sight!!"
49,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2019,not available,"Poncha Springs Colorado, United States ",Moose and more Moose,Beautiful drive between Moose and Teton Village. We have seen moose every time we have taken this drive. If you want to see moose take the drive.
50,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019,not available,"Chicopee, MA ",Beautiful Area,"We saw other reviews about this area and decided to travel from our hotel in Jackson Hole. It was an easy ride , yes, part is dirt but only lasts 1 mile or so. We drove by Teton Village. This quaint, quiet road, is a beautiful ride, we did not see any wildlife on our way to the entrance to GTNP in Moose but that didn't matter, so nice, but on our way back through, a few deer jumped in front of our car and and ran across the road, no moose but I just think you have to be in the right place in the right time... just enjoy the beauty."
51,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019,not available,"Port Charlotte, FL ",Slow down and enjoy!,"We were on this road at sunrise! Slow down your pace and look for animals. We saw Elk, but no moose, until we got in to Moose Wyoming. There we saw one, in a parking area!"
52,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Great place to view and stay,"We stayed in a condo on Moose Wilson Rd. which offers a quick and easy “backdoor” entrance to Grand Teton NP. Closer to the park than staying in Jackson, but also just a 10 minute drive into town. We had deer behind our condo every morning and great wildlife viewing as you approach and enter the park via this road. We saw a black bear lingering in a creek just inside the park and moose both in and out of the park. We stayed later at Jackson Lake Lodge, which we really love, but Moose Wilson Rd was a great location. If you’re going up to Yellowstone this is a little more distant than being in Jackson or staying in GTNP or in Yellowstone. But we had been to Yellowstone and wanted to focus on the Tetons on this trip."
53,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019 , Solo,"Seal Beach, CA ",Scenic Drive,Beautiful scenic drive. I observed 2 black bears. The National Park volunteers are very informative and helpful.
54,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2019 , Couples,"Carlsbad, NM ",Pretty drive,Call ahead to find out the best time to drive this road. Larger vehicles are not allowed due to the narrow and winding road. We didn't see any wildlife when we went in the morning or afternoon. A lot of vehicles travel this road. The tour companies drive too fast through here making it somewhat dangerous. Pay close attention to the road and let your passengers scope for wildlife.
55,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2019,not available,"Capitola, CA ","Didn""t see any Moose","Nice drive,seeing wild life depends on the season, time of day and luck. Teton's are spectacular any time of year."
56,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2019 , Family,"Chicago, IL, ",Moose,I drove this road with my kids. The road is dirt and bumpy in the middle. We saw a mom moose with a baby and then up a little we got a view of a large female eating. It was a great time and doesn’t take that long.
57,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Peoria, IL, ",Beautiful with or without moose!,"We drove this road early one summer morning in hopes of seeing moose. We struck out on that, but definitely didn't regret doing this peaceful drive. Around 730 in the morning, most pull-offs had only one or two cars, and all you could hear were the birds singing and water running. The scenery is just stunning.    As others have mentioned, a small section of the road is very bumpy gravel. We just went super slowly, and our car did fine. You won't be driving quickly on any part of this road--it is mainly made for scenic driving."
58,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2019 , Family,"Cross Plains, WI ",Lots of moose,It is gravel for part of the Road but we really didn’t find it to be that bad and we were driving in a 15 passenger Ford transit van. Went back again the next day. Moose were out Early and late in the day.
59,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2019 , Family,"Peoria, IL ",Your fillings and Kidneys will be tested,"A decent part of this road is dirt and has as many potholes as some battlefields had during there time. If you want a bone jarring road only a Chiropractor can fix, this is your road."
60,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2019 , Family,New Jersey ,Caution if large Car,Beautiful drive but fair amount of road is not paved and closed part of the year. Very narrow and twisty. At times you wonder if it is 2 way ! On that stretch you barely go over 25 miles per hour.. so caution and do not attempt late in day or night.
61,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Asheville, NC ",Mama and Baby Moose,"This area is right up the road from Teton Village- a must see for everyone! On our way back to the RV Park, we had the great pleasure of seeing a Baby and Mama Moose. All tucked and hidden off the side of the road. Super surprise!!!"
62,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Pecatonica, IL, ","This is bumpy gravel from Moose, WY to Teton Village.","When going west from Moose, the first couple miles are paved. Then, it changes into gravel, then bumpy gravel. However, there is beautiful scenery, and then this road goes to Teton Village without having to drive through Jackson to get there."
63,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ","Worth It, Even if you Don't See Wildlife","We drove this road four or five times while on our vacation in the Tetons. We never once saw any wildlife on it. I guess we were just unlucky. We drove it at many different times of the day as well. I know at one of the spots to pull off, we did just miss a bear by a few minutes. However, that was the closest we got to seeing wildlife on this road. It was still fun to drive on and search for the wildlife, even when you don't see it.    As for the condition of the road, there are a few spots that are bad. However, we drove on way worse roads on our vacation than this. Our minivan did just fine. Remember to go slow and keep those eyes open for wildlife.    Our kids are ages 7,9,11, and 13 and we had fun looking out the windows the whole time."
64,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2019 , Couples,Michigan ,great scenery,"I loved Moose Wilson Road. It was a beautiful drive in which there are unlimited chances to see wildlife. It is spectacular even with what nature just provides along the way. It can be busy, but still beautiful."

66,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ","Great Road for Wildlife, But Go Slow!","An absolutely beautiful road to drive. You’re not going to get scenic views of the mountains, but you will drive along a tight, mostly dirt road that hugs the trees, which means ample opportunity for wildlife. In a half hour, we saw a cow moose and her calf and a racoon. Other people that same day saw bears, elk, and a bull moose. It is a must drive. However, unless you have an off-road vehicle, be careful. Everyone should drive the speed limit or under. Don’t let people behind you rush you. They can wait. It’s for their own safety. Wildlife can dart out at any moment, killing you, themselves, and/or totaling your vehicle. So, better safe than sorry. Anyways, you’re in the wilderness. Enjoy it! Why the rush?"
67,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2019 , Family,"Minnesota City, MN ",Hidden Gem,"Just as the name suggests, its a great opportunity to see a moose and possibly fairly close. Not a guarantee and a little off the beaten path, but worth it if you are lucky enough to see one or two"
68,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Frankfort, IL ",Winding Narrow Road,"This road really looks like you should see wildlife on it but unfortunately, we didn’t. The road is very narrow and you have to be careful because there are lots of curves. We were on it in the daytime, I’d warn you to never drive it after dark if it is unfamiliar to you. Maybe you’ll get lucky and see some things! I rated it very good because how could it not be with the Grand Tetons all around it?"

74,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2018 , Solo,"Indianapolis, IN ",No Moose! But worth driving up and down this road!,"Determined to see a moose, I drove this road 4 times on 2 different days. I ran into lots of folks who'd ""just seen one"" but I never actually saw a moose myself. (""You just missed them...they went that way..."") The road in the fall was gorgeous. So many beautiful trees and then it began to snow. Wow! A small lovely road."

After being at Jackson Hole we were so glad that we were staying at Wilson it is much quieter! This road is a lovely drive especially in Autumn ( fall ). It also is part of the Grand Teton Loop Rd
81,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2018 , Family,"Greenville, SC ",Wildlife live here,We saw a moose and her calf along this road. They were just grazing along and taking their time. Wonderful.
82,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Independence, KY ",Wildlife Central!,"Oh my goodness, the bears were everywhere on this road...up close and personal! This is a paradise for wildlife seekers and probably a nightmare for the poor Park Rangers monitoring this area! We did not see any moose in this area but we did see many elk."
83,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Port Orchard, WA ",You will likely see moose,"We took this road and seen moose both times we were on it, both were different moose. Easy to access, a must if your close. The scenery is absolutely amazing!"
84,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"United Kingdom, ",Be patient and factor in the road conditions and the rangers,"This road is very narrow and windy and there are few places to stop, so if you do see wildlife you'll be lucky if you can stop safely. Factor in that the rangers are also keeping an eye on what's around and moving people on or further back accordingly.    That said we drove the road 3 times and got a glimpse of a bull moose behind a tree, a mother and calf sitting in the grass, a bear cub running across the road (mum had already crossed) and a bear up a tree by the side of the road where we couldn't stop and two people were already blocking the road.    There are places where you can park and get out and walk and there is birdlife, so I also watched Mergansers in the pond and a Heron catching fish/frogs etc. There are lots of people, but its still a great place to see wildlife."
85,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2018,not available,"Kansas City, MO, ",Best place in the park for wildlife viewing,We saw so many moose here. Also saw a black bear with 3 cubs feasting on Hawthorne berries. Saw an elk as well. In the past I spotted a great grey owl here. Road is fairly narrow in places.
86,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,Fort Atkinson ,Okay - if you see wildlife. Otherwise just a road.,"We didn't see anything. While I realize that animals aren't on display and don't follow a human schedule, it isn't like some areas of Yellowstone where you will see wildlife no matter when you go. Given that your road options are limited it is a positive that it is a low stress route."
87,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018,not available,"Orlando, FL ",Tooooooooo many people,"Definitely great for wildlife but overly crowded. People are crazy. Had black bear eating in berries on edge of road in tree, cubs behind her in Aspen. Wonderful site but within minutes overwhelmed with people, including stupid people who were too close for safety and of respect to the poor bear trying to get ready for winter. I would say a toxic combo. Only did it once because of people insanity."
88,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Family,"Melbourne, FL ",Wildlife!,"We drove this road several times during our stay. For all those times, only once did we not see game (mid-day) - bears, moose, elk. The rangers do have a strong presence here, so it can sometimes be a little frustrating, as they wave you on without your being able to see the animals. And there can sometimes be traffic backed up, due to people trying to view. The bears seemed to be the biggest issue, as they were usually in the trees."
89,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Marysville, OH ",Definitely a Must!!!!!,"We drove this early in the morning from Teton Village/Wilson end to Moose and back. The aspens were gorgeous and there was a lot of beautiful, natural plants and bushes in fall colors. We saw a bear with 2 cubs up in the aspens next to the road, literally above our heads. Two rangers were directing traffic giving cars plenty of time to take pics. We saw a bull moose in the marshy area and close enough to get good pics. The road is initially dirt but quickly becomes paved. No problems on dirt portion."

91,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",Wildlife viewing backroad to and from Jackson Wyoming,Moose-Wilson road is an alternative route to and from Jackson Wyoming and the Grand Teton National Park. It proved to be an excellent wildlife viewing opportunity. We saw Moose and Black Bears up close and personal! Getting to the road from Jackson takes you by Teton Village and an opportunity to view wildlife of a different kind! This is a scenic route worth your time.
92,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Linthicum Heights, MD ",Morning or Evening is a must,"If you want to see animals, this is the stretch of road. We stayed in Wilson, so we would drive this stretch from 7 pm to 8 pm every night. We saw bear, moose, deer and elk constantly. We looked forward to doing this every night. Tip: if you are looking for animals, pull over when you can to let other cars go by you that may not be animal watching. Be polite."
93,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"De Pere, WI ",Wildlife Viewing Opportunity,"In our trips to the Grand Tetons National Park the Moose-Wilson Road has provided us with more wildlife viewing than any other location in the Park. We usually start near the Moose Visitor Center and drive to the Laurance Rockefeller Preserve and turn around. The Moose-Wilson road continues beyond the Rockefeller Preserve (all the way to Jackson), but the road gets rougher and we have not seen wildlife along this stretch of the road.    We usually drive the roadway at least three times per day when we are in the park  .  As you drive the road from the Moose Visitor Center your first opportunity will be the sawmill ponds. There is a good size parking lot at the location, which overlooks a pond and wooded area. You will have a good opportunity to see moose at this location but unfortunately the moose while visible will be a long ways away.    As you continue on the road, the next two miles follows a low marshland. Look for moose, bear and coyote along this stretch.    On our recent three day trip to the park, we viewed the same two moose on each trip through for two days, we saw a small coyote twice (once eating berries along the road), and on our last trip we saw a black bear with her three cubs in a tree eating berries.    If you drive the road and don’t see anything, don’t give up. Wait a few hours and drive it again."
94,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Inverness, UK ",Disappointing,"Billed as very narrow and winding, we decided to take this road winsome trepidation. Shouldn’t have worried though as it is a straightforward drive and there was no difficulty passing traffic coming the other way - of which there was a lot. The volume of traffic may have explained the absence of wildlife. The thickness of the woodland also meant that the drive was not particularly scenically attractive    We were staying East of the Teton pass so at least this route had the distinct advantage of not having to drive through Jackson to get back to our B&B."
95,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Clermont, FL ",You never know what to expect,"We participated in a Wilderness Caravan offered by the park service and this was our last stop. As the sun went down, we saw a moose and calf as the sun set. We returned the next morning to find a mother black bear and 3 cubs feeding in the brush. Lots of great pictures during both visits."

99,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Macon, GA ",What an adventure,"We had some time to kill so someone had suggested to us to take this road. First curve we saw a huge moose. Later we saw a bear. The road is a little rough, so travel slow. But you are almost guaranteed to see wildlife."
100,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2018 , Friends,"La Quinta, CA ","A little rough and narrow at times, but worth the drive.","We visited Teton National Park and took the main road into the park. Upon leaving we took the Moose-Wilson Road, which can be rough and narrow at times but it's the best road to view Moose if they are in the area. Then stop at Calico for dinner!"
101,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2018 , Solo,"Danville, CA, ",Great Short Cut When Open,"We were staying in Teton Village. For the first few days, the Moose Wilson road was closed because the bears were on the road eating berries. So to go into Grand Teton or Yellowstone, we had to drive south, through Jackson then north into the parks. On the last day, Moose Wilson Road opened. It's a very narrow winding road. You have two slow when approaching cars coming the other way. For the first part, there are some nice views. Then the vegetation gets pretty thick. It does save some time. And it was a nice change of pace from the more circuitous route."
102,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2018 , Family,"Westfield, IN ","Beautiful (but bumpy) ride, and no moose for us",We drove in during early evening hours on Moose Wilson but unfortunately did not see any moose on our drive. Either way the road is beautiful!
103,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2018 , Couples,St Louis ,Went looking for Moose,Took the Moose Wilson road looking for moose and was not disappointed. Took the road on three occasions and saw Moose every time. Usually very close to the road. There are signs that flash when Moose are in the vicinity.
104,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2018 , Family,Stamford ,Scenic drive but no moose,"We drove here about an hour before sunset and although it was picturesque, we didn't see any moose. We had the Gypsy app and the commentary on this road was good. I was glad we did it to see another part of Grand Teton."

Take it slow and hopefully you get lucky
106,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Family,"Palmdale, CA ",Good spot for moose sightings,"It's hard not to see wildlife in the Jackson/Grand Teton area....bison, pronghorn, and mule deer are plentiful. If you want to see a moose, this road is aptly named. We drove it two separate times during our stay in Jackson and saw moose both times.    Our Tip: Go just after sundown (dusk)....in late June this was around 9:00. We saw a big moose munching on some bushes right near the road in someone's front yard.    If you plan on driving the full length of the road, be advised that the road condition deteriorates quickly once you pass Jackson Hole Ski Resort and enter the National Park....it gets really bumpy.    Also, make sure to check out the water just south of Teton Pass Highway (right before you turn on Moose Wilson). We saw a cow and calf here as well."
107,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2018 , Family, ,Lives Up to Its Name,This road has a scenic overlook for moose habitat- we were very excited to see 2 moose along our drive! Road can be narrow at times and part of it is dirt road but certainly doable. Beautiful views of wildflowers and river along the drive into Teton.

109,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2018 , Couples,"Nine Mile Falls, WA ",Narrow road,This is a short cut from Wilson to moose and it bypasses Jackson. They say no rvs but a pickup camper will do fine as long as others are not hogging the road. Several peoples jaws dropped as we passed..
110,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2018 , Family,Maryland ,"Take your rental car, SUV preferred","We took Moose Wilson Road from the inner parkway of Grand Teton NP to Jackson Hole area. The first stretch was paved narrow road, but the last mile or two was all gravel and very bumpy. I kept telling myself glad it was a rental car and SUV. We were hoping to see moose along the way, didn't see any wildlife at 2:00PM or 6:00PM."
111,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Family,"Bowling Green, KY ",Challenging but Interesting,"This is a rough-riding road full of massive pot holes but lined with wildlife. We saw deer, bears, and an osprey. There is a speed limit posted but not necessary because the road is so rough you have to drive slow."
112,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Friends, ,So scenic,I love taking this back road route to and from Teton Village. It can get a bit rough though. And they were doing construction this last trip so things can get a bit backed up but it is always so worth it to me. It’s such a beautiful drive and always tons of wildlife along the way! A must do at least once if you’ve never tried it!
113,Moose-Wilson-Road,May 2018 , Couples,"Uniontown, OH ",Get off the beaten path and away from the crowds!,"Yes, it's a slow-moving back road, but you get away from the crowds and get the feeling of really being out in the woods. We drove this 3 times and each time it was beautiful. Just be careful of heading east to west around rush hour if you are planning to drive through Jackson Hole. The traffic looked to be backed up for miles and miles!"
114,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Wichita, KS ",Great drive for wildlife spotting!,"We drove this road twice and were lucky to see a large moose just off the road. Take the drive slow as the unpaved portion of the road is pretty rough in some spots. I would never drive this road in a rental car or low clearance vehicle, but an AWD SUV handles it just fine. Be careful and watch for potholes and large mammals! The road is mostly forested, so you are not doing this drive for scenery, just for wildlife. I would recommend this as a great drive to make on a cloudy day when the surrounding scenery is obscured by clouds."
115,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Santa Cruz, CA ",Slow and quiet,"This lovely road is off limits for buses, rvs, and cars with trailers--so it's quiet and slow. It's actually a dirt road for a big section. Very, very pretty views. If you want a feast for your senses, stop at the Rockefeller Reserve. This is part of the National Park, but is completely different than the other visitor centers. Stroll through several rooms that don't TELL you things--they invite your senses to see and especially HEAR. And once you have sat quietly and acclimated your senses, take the hike to Phelps Lake. Suddenly you are seeing. You are hearing. The Forest is alive. Because the parking is very, very, very limited (on purpose), the trails are quiet; the lake overlook is quiet--just one or two other families. This is the antidote to the Jenny Lake crowds. The hike is easy though, so families can enjoy it. Can't recommend it enough. Get there when it opens at 9!"
116,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Family,"Ringgold, GA ",You will see a moose!,We love this road. We drove it three times while in Jackson last week. We saw two moose!

119,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Family, ,Pretty cool,Drove this road at least twice and saw wildlife both times. Only problem we’re those who were inconsiderate and didn’t move their cars over far enough and didn’t care to move and let anyone through.
120,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018,not available, ,Road condition is excellent right now.,"About a mile of this road is unpaved near the town of Teton Village, which they had recently graded in June. Passenger cars can easily access the road. The road is a nice short cut from Teton Village to the national park and ends near the visitor center. Many people use this road to view wild life; however, we never had much luck. We saw an elk or two and that was pretty much it, although we did meet people who did see moose at one of the pull outs. You cannot just stop in the middle of the road! It's a very narrow, 2-way road, so only park when there's an obvious turnout. The area is pretty and there's a few trails here (park at the The Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve).    I've read accounts of how rough the road was and I assume that the unpaved portion deteriorates at some point. So, if you're uncertain about the conditions, call the park to get an update. There's a park booth at the start of the road just past Teton Village."
121,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2018 , Family, ,Something different every time,"I first visited the Tetons in September, and there is almost no better place to enjoy a drive through the colorful aspens than this road. It is also the home of many different creatures that are often easily spotted here. We saw a young black bear. It walked right in front of our car. There are also owls, moose, and varied songbirds that are commonly seen here. I visited this place last week and observed a spectrum of flowers and colorful birds. It is one of my favorite places in the park."

On the first drive through we saw 2 moose (meese? messen?) grazing in the willows. The road is a fun drive, even if it doesn't save you time, but with Jackson Hole having construction on Gros Ventre and the intersection with the Highway going over the mountain to Victor, ID, it may be your only construction free way around those obstacles."
129,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Alton, New Hampshire, United States ",Did not disappoint,I had expected to see wildlife the length of the road but the greatest sightings were at the pull off closest to the parks pay to enter toll area.

131,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Muscle Shoals, AL ",Beautiful but narrow,"This is a great drive if you have the vehicle for it. We were in a 4x4 Tahoe. The day we went, snow was melting and the part of the road that turns into gravel was messy. Our white vehicle was no longer white. Parts of the road a very narrow. We did see two sets of mother black bear and their cubs. This made the mud worth the drive. I would not recommend this drive in a car, but we saw several people in cars making the drive."
132,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Miami, FL ","Quite Bumpy, but good for seeing wildlife","We had to take this road on most days to get out of Teton Village and to Yellowstone or just going north. We saw a grizzly and her two cubs two separate days, then we saw a cub right by the road on a 3rd day. Saw Moose from far, but they were laying down and were hard to see. Finally, we did see an elk bull and several female elk. They were were bugling and that was amazing!!! Best to see them in the early morning or late evening. It is a rough road with lots of potholes, but they may keep it this way to slow down traffic."
133,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Ballycastle, UK ",Bumpy,Drove this road twice this week and saw neither bears or Moose! Just unlucky I suppose! It is known as a top wildlife viewing area but the wildlife doesn't always oblige. Part of the road is badly potholed and care is needed. I'd recommend taking a look and hope that the animals are on view.
134,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Austin, TX ",Don't miss it!,"We drove home from Grand Tetons to Jackson via this road at dusk. Don't miss it! We saw several moose - kind of causing a traffic jam on this narrow mountain road, so there were park rangers out to direct traffic!"

136,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Family,SF Bay Area ,Moose Siting,One of the things I wanted to experience on this trip was to see a moose in the wild. I asked at the Visitor Center where they had seen them lately. I was told Moose Wilson Road. We went one morning at around 9:30. The ranger we stopped to talk with said that they were out earlier in the morning. We went back the next morning at 8:00 and there they were. It was an experience I won't soon forget.
137,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Stevensville, MD ",Great Opportunity for Wildlife Viewing,"The area is a top spot for wildlife viewing and hiking. We have been on this road several times over two separate trips to the area. We have seen Bears, Elk, and Moose. The road is about 10 miles long and is one entrance to the Grand Teton National Park. There are viewing opportunities all along the road, but the most popular area is a pulloff near the main Grand Teton entrance side to the road. This area is really popular for possible bear and moose sightings. While cars can access this road, there is about a 1.5 mile stretch this not not paved and can be rough in areas."

We saw 3 black bears in three different places, one was eating in the field just beyond the river near the parking area. The other two were close to the road in other spots. Have to be careful of the traffic jams when everyone stops to see the wildlife. We didn't see any moose here although someone else said they saw a small calf. We did see a large herd of elk just beyond Teton Village heading toward Jackson and two moose (cows) also on Rt 22 just past the Snake River bridge, late afternoon."

There is one section of the is road that is not paved and is a little rough in places with pot holes. Small cars need to drive very carefully so as not to bottom out. We did see some moose, a black bear and a deer while driving this road, so wildlife seems to be pretty abundant in the area. Keep your eyes open and drive slowly."

There is a Moose Habitat along the road where we saw a mama bear and her cub splashing in the water but alas, no moose. But we did notice that people came back at different times during the day as we did. It was fun to chat with the rangers and the tourists. The drive provides beautiful scenery and the opportunity to see various wildlife. The rough gravel part of the road did not diminish the experience."

But it has been surprisingly busy with wildlife on my few drives. You'll want to go slow and look but you could find some wildlife and at the very least some decent wildlife views. Or the 40 mile views you'll find further up in the parks but more of an up close look. Try it and I hop you like it."
144,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Madison, WI ",Wildlife everyday,We were in the Tetons for a week and traveled Moose/Wilson Rd 3 times. Shortly after getting on the road by Moose visitor center there is a small gravel parking area overlooking a pond area but we never saw any moose in it. Each time we saw Moose ( cow & young ) both in the ponds and on the road a little furthur past the parking area. We also saw a black bear eating berries in the brush just off the road. We have been on this road in the past and never came across any moose so this trip was great. We saw moose in the middle of the day not just morning or evening.
145,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017,not available,"California, ",Can be great for animal viewing,Narrow road that is unpaved for two of its ten mile length.  Slow driving.

149,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2017 , Family,Overland Park ,Access to Back-Country trails and Quick Way Between Teton Village and Moose,"This is worth the trip between Teton Village and Moose Junction. Mostly paved, it's still a dirt/gravel road at the south end. This is the only access (except hiking) to Death Canyon and Granite Creek trailheads. The Lawrence S. Rockefeller Preserve is also off this road. Even the paved section is narrow and twisty. Trailers and motorhomes are prohibited on this road. Over the years we've seen a bear with cubs and moose, so it worth a drive just in case you get lucky. Another benefit we found is you get into Jackson from the west on WY 22 and on this trip the backup to Jackson from the north on US191 was about 2 miles long. From the west, there was effectively no backup. No guarantees!"
150,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Edison, NJ  ",Never saw any wildlife,"Oh well, never saw any wildlife on this road although so many people told us we would. Looks like it would have been a place to view moose especially because of the terrain."
151,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2017 , Friends,"Wilmington, NC ",Rough Road,"The road was rough, but beautiful scenery. Unfortunately, we didn't see any moose, but the road saved us a lot of time going to Yellowstone and Tetons parks."

We saw some deer but no moose."

159,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2017 , Family,"Orrville, OH ",Unpleasant Experience,"My family protested when I turned onto this road, but I took it anyway. I should have listened. The road was narrow, bumpy, and felt almost as busy as a city freeway during rush hour. A few miles in my sharp-eyed daughter spotted a moose and calf that no one else had apparently seen yet. But in the short time it took to turn the vehicle around to get a better look a jam on both sides of the road had begun to form with people running about everywhere. Not my sort of wildlife viewing. We decided to pass on by. Shortly thereafter we met an RV that nearly forced us off the road. I caught a glimpse of the driver and noticed his wide-eyed terror stricken expression. Perhaps next time he will heed the signs forbidding travel to RV's. Unless the road is leading to a destination, I would highly recommend not taking it; or if traveling from the east not continuing beyond the first overlook. I don't think the stressful drive was worth it, even though we saw a moose."
160,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2017,not available, ,Part of the road is under construction,"This road is very narrow and curvy. We did not see any wildlife while on the drive but it was raining that day. We were told that there is a moose and calf that are seen here on occasion. We saw moose not here, but by the Jackson Lake Lodge and by the ferry at Jenny Lake. You can only go so far and then the road is closed for construction and you have to turn around."

167,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2017,not available, ,You have to be lucky to catch Moose here,"When I heard the name of the road, we thought we will be seeing quite a few Moose around here, because Teton is known for it's Moose. However, before we took the route we talked with a ranger who told us that timings matter as the places the road overlooks don't always have the shade and chances of watching a Moose is better when there's shade and water involved. So, we turned back and took this trip around 6:30 in the afternoon. The road is really very narrow and bumpy but we were lucky as we saw Moose at the first spot of Snake River. But again, remember, try to go there early in the morning or before sunset, otherwise you will be left disappointed."
168,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2017,not available,"Verona, KY ",Saw nothing - must go early/late,We wasted our time animal searching twice on this long bumpy road. Don't go unless you're extremely early (we went at 7am) or immediatley before sunset (we went around 7:30pm). You might get lucky but we saw nothing but a deer.
169,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2017 , Solo,"Worcester, UK, ",Overwhelming experience and worth the 6 hour round trip,"I drove down here, both ways, from early sunrise in the hope I might see a Moose. While I was talking to others during the same route they said they had seen a grizzly bear and her three cubs the day before.    Driving down towards Teton Village I saw a couple of Elk stags in the distance. I wanted to get closer because they were situated behind a fence about 50 yards in front of me, but out of respect I kept my distance. Just wish I had had a camera with a long sense as I only had my iPad 3 with me. I took a few short but the quality of the camera on the iPad was not as good as I had hoped.    By the time I drove back the stags had gone. I drove on and eventually saw a Female Moose sitting behind a tree just the other side of the river. I hung around for ages in the hope that it would get up and move but I had to give up and move on myself.    Eventually I drove a little further up the road and just as a I stopped the car I saw a female Moose with her calf a few yards below me by the river. I remained patient and eventually the moose stood up and began feeding and I shot a few snaps and lots of video. This one experience made my holiday. I hoped to see a male Moose but sometimes you can't have everything in life; but the pictures I have will remain with me forever.    I would recommend this trip to anyone either at first light and up to about 8am and at dusk, once the sun has gone down. Moose will keep out of the sun in the day and come to the reeds to feed when it is cool enough. Good Luck, my waiting was definitely worthwhile and I would recommend this to anyone interested in wildlife."
170,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2017 , Couples,Jackpot ,Moose and Bear!,"A bit of a bumpy, part gravel road but a great drive if you want to see animals! Take your time and you will probably see Moose.

178,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2017 , Family, ,narrow dirt road not suitable for large cars or nervous drivers,"The road is appropriately narrow to keep speed slow in a national park, but it is also the highway bypass to Teton Village from the north. The traffic is horrible because stupid large cars and trucks cause havoc. If you have all day to drive on a narrow road and seldom see anything other than the dust of the car in front of you, give it a try"

Knowing that the best times to spot wildlife are right around sunrise and sunset, we drove it again at 8:30pm and saw a Red-tailed Hawk, geese, 2 young foxes playing, elk, deer, and a moose. The road is paved except for a short section and doesn't take long to drive. Please drive slowly, the animals are often in or near the road, the foxes were darting in and out of the road chasing each other when we saw them."

But this was a can't miss place for wildlife -- moose, beavers, bears in particular. Go early or late in the day, drive slowly, be prepared for other tourists, and be alert. Others are correct about the potholes (the size and abundance of which cannot be overstated (and I was in a Ford Expedition!)), but those only are unavoidable if you come up from Teton Village. If you start by the visitor center, you can turn around by the Rockefeller Preserve and do it all on paved road."
186,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Leland, NC ",Bumpy,There is great scenery from the mountains to the foliage to the wildlife. But much of the road is not paved and can be a bumpy ride. Not to be missed though.

Also a good shortcut to airport or The Parks if coming from Teton Village. A few places to stop, but the National Park Service usually accommodates stopped cars and people trying to get a photo whenever wildlife decides to amble through. We've seen many moose, a couple of bears and beavers. Sometimes we just enjoy the forest."

190,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Henderson, NV ",suggestion for avoiding potholes,Just did this earlier this week. Potholes are real axel breakers if you don't go real slow. My take is to start at the NORTH end which is the best part anyway and then turn around when you reach the Rockefeller nature preserve(there's a big sign and driveway on the left). The pavement goes past this for a little way but when you reach the unpaved section it isn't as nice anyway. The trees were pretty but we didn't see any animals at all hence the average rating.
191,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Dalton, OH ",Sadly the tourists are what makes this such a bad experience,"I never in all my life have seen such rude tourists as I have seen on this road. We twice saw photographers harassing the moose so bad they ran out in to traffic, with the mother and calf both nearly being hit by vehicles. Sadly, the wildlife enforcement seems to be understaffed and not aggressive enough towards these abuses which is sad. If you can get past some of the idiots in the park, it's a great experience, but it sometimes can be hard to do"
192,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Houston, TX ",Glad we made this drive one late afternoon,"moose, small bear, elk, nice fall foliage made this drive worth doing. Stop at Rockefeller Preserve and hike to Phelps Lake if possible. Saw a small black bear at the preserve at dusk"
193,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Seaside, OR ","If you want to see wildlife, go right before sunset or sunrise","We travelled this road several times during our visit to Grand Tetons. It is addicting, because you always see something. You can only pull off at the graveled part of the road, where there are several parking spaces. We always saw photographers with their tripods and long lenses looking at something, and usually they were really nice and would show you the wildlife through their lens. We saw a huge grey owl that way. Once you are driving along the road again, you can't stop and there are usually rangers walking along the road to point out a moose, and remind you to stay in your car. So drive really slow and pay attention to the marshes. We saw several moose, including a bull, sow, and baby. We also saw a small bear. The one time we went right at sunrise, the place was crawling with wildlife, including too many moose to count, a red fox and lots of elk and deer. But tourists can be really inappropriate and we saw a bunch hanging out of their car, and flashing pictures just feet away from the animals, please remember you are in their home, not the other way around."
194,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2016 , Friends,"Romeo, MI ",Moose!,"Drove the road today and sighted a cow and a bull moose in the swampy area. Great drive. The road is dirt for several mile and heavily potholed , take the drive slow and keep your eyes open for wildlife ."

It took us so long to get here from Yellowstone that I think we were too late in the day...about 10am. It was pretty hot, so the animals were probably in shelter somewhere. Road was not particularly scenic but also was not as bumpy as I feared. I'd try this again but either closer to dawn or at dusk."
197,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Alvin, TX ",Great road to see wildlife(especially moose) on!,We went down this road 2 times to view wildlife. We were not disappointed. Saw a moose and her baby the first trip and the second time we saw a bull moose laying in the grass/brush. Some part of the road was bumpy and unpaved but worth it for a chance to see animals.
198,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Westfield, WI ",Moose Searching,"The sun was shinning and the aspen were shimmering. Saw one moose. Used to be many more but with the increasing number of wolves their numbers are greatly diminished. This road is very narrow, at times one lane and not always paved. Depending on the time of day you will need a Park pass to travel this road. I am unsure if it is plowed in the winter. It is a great way to avoid downtown Jackson, not a quick route but scenic. Lots of traffic the am we drove it. Need to watch out for folks who stop without warning. Recently closed d/t bear activity. Definitely worth your time."
199,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Hackettstown, NJ ",Do not miss Moose Wilson Road!,"Thank you Trip Advisors! About 5 minutes after getting into our rental car at the airport, we were on Moose Wilson Rd. We stopped at the pond at the top of the hill where there is a parking area for about a dozen cars. Everyone had a camera out, so I was hopeful. A moose! How lucky were we? We traveled the road several more times, seeing moose on 4 more occasions, also beaver, and one bear in a tree. The Rangers do a good job managing visitors and their cars. There are limited spots to pull off the road, but you can slow down and briefly stop to take a photo. We did wish we had rented a car with a sunroof. Trying to get a photo that didn't include a rear view window was an issue. So, it wound up we saw more wildlife here on this road than anywhere else!"
200,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Fort Myers, FL, ",Moose and great hikes in this area,"We drove down Moose Wilson Road from the north to the south in September. It was not very wide, have to be careful letting other cars pass. Part of it is gravel road but not too bumpy. There are marshes off to one side and we saw at least two moose off to the side eating in the swamp. Rangers were there keeping the traffic moving past the moose.    We turned around and went back up the Death Canyon trailhead road. This road is unpaved and quite rocky. We hiked to the Phelps Lake Overlook -- all uphill to the Overlook and downhill on the way back. Walking down to the lake would've been another mile -- a steep hike back up. The Overlook was beautiful and enough for us."

The ride itself starts paved then goes to the bumpiest mud road that I've been on and then gets paved again. All 4 times across I saw no bear and no moose. I did see some large elk. And it was a fun adventure.
204,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2016 , Family,"Evansville, IN ",Best chance for wildlife,"I would recommend taking this drive at least once. It was the only place we saw moose and a bear. We would have missed both if it hadn't been for other cars pulling over. So be sure to ask other tourists what's up when they are observing something, and have your passengers spotting the bushes (bears eat the berries) and valleys (the moose like the wet areas). Good luck!"
205,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Moose Hunting,Wow what a find. The guidebooks were correct. I think a lot of wildlife viewing is being in the right place at the right time. We went 6 times and each time there were moose and bears. Both were females and baby's. There is a viewing lookout that was great. We would start there and then drive up and back on the road. We would drive about 2 miles and turnaround. We saw moose and bears on both side of the road. The only issue there is the park service has volunteer Rangers and they can be a pain. They are on the road and won't let you slow down or stop to take pictures so you have to be fast. Lol.
206,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Omaha, NE ",Thought This Was A Shortcut,"We were coming into GTNP from Idaho due to the South entrance of Yellowstone being closed to fire. This looked like a shorter route on the map. However, a lot of the road is gravel. Have a new car and would not have done this if I had realized. It was a pretty ride but would rather have spent the time in the park."
207,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2016,not available,Kentucky ,Wildlife Viewing Spot,"Moose Wilson road connects the towns of Wilson and Moose. It is located west of Jackson. This road is where Teton Pines Country Club, Aspens condos, and one of the ski resorts are located. To access the GTNP for those persons staying in this area, it is closer to take Moose-Wilson Road instead of going back through Jackson. The road in not paved for a short stretch and the paved section is narrow. We usually see some type of wildlife each time we travel the road, especially in the morning or late afternoon. This year, one trip out the road back toward our condo in the Aspens we saw a mama moose and baby, a bear, and a mama elk and baby. This is a bear area..rangers are often standing beside the road moving traffic due to the heavy bear activity. There is also an overlook where it is common to view moose. From the Aspens, it takes us about 30 minutes to reach Moose but we go slowly and watch for critters!"

213,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Phoenix, AZ ",Great Spot Moose,"It seems kind of silly to rate natural parks. However, esp. in the fall this road towards the park is one of the best spots. It is very narrow and the park service has restricted stopping at some of the better points. We have found equally as good of moose view on the Gros Vontre road near the campground and at Schwamchbacker landing. I've probably misspelled both both places but get a park map they're listed on it."

We saw a bunch of cars pulled over to the side of the road which is always a clear sign that something interesting is happening. We ended up seeing a moose and her calf drinking from the water about 200 feet away from us. There also happened to be 2 park rangers there who answered questions on how they like to feed and where the best places were to spot them. The road is right near the entrance to Teton National Park and you can easily miss it (which we did initially). I would recommend taking a quick detour to drive down this road even if you're not planning on going to the LR Preserve.

226,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Solo,"Sioux City, IA ",Nice drive and yes there were moose!,"This is a nice drive with a few places to pull over. If you want to see moose, start early. I also recommend stopping and taking a hike at the Phelps Lake area."
227,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2016 , Family,"Douglasville, GA ",Great Drive,We decided to try this road on the way out of Yellowstone in the middle of the day. We were not real confident but It was worth the extra few minutes. We were able to get within 30 yards of a young bull moose and a large cow. We also saw mule deer as well.
228,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2016 , Family,"Thomasville, GA ",Yes we saw the moose,This area is quiet but very convenient to Jackson. Head north from here to get to Jenny and Jackson Lakes. There are plenty of places to rent and we stayed in a 2 BR loft condo. We were 5 minutes from Teton Village and 15 mins from downtown Jackson. We did not want the cacophony of the city yet enjoyed our visits there.
229,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Moline, IL ",Mother and baby moose,"We stopped by this location twice, the first day we didn't see any moose but the second day we were rewarded. There was a mother moose eating and a baby moose that was sleeping in some tall grass. Eventually the baby moose got up and started walking towards it's mother - it made my day. We did see other moose while we were here but this was my favorite."
230,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Yulee, FL ",This road lives up to it's billing,"Seeing moose on this trip was high on my wife's list of things to do during this trip. We took folks advice to drive down this road as the sun was rising. We saw a huge herd of elk by Teton Village. Within minutes of getting on the dirt road we saw the first of three moose for the day.    Our first moose was a cow grazing on the side of the road, we watched her for several minutes before moving on. We came across a young bull minutes later. We saw the third moose as we were coming into Moose."
231,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2016 , Family,"Harrisburg, PA ",Moose were visible,"We did not see any moose in Yellowstone over several days, but we did see two on the Moose Wilson Road."
232,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2016 , Family,"Redondo Beach, CA ",Saw a moose on Moose Wilson Road!,My main goal for visiting the Tetons was to see a moose. Fortunately we were able to see a female moose and her calf just a foot away from the road. The mother was in a pond next to the road and the calf kept crossing the road back and forth (I was very worried about it getting hit by a car). It was the only place we saw a moose.
233,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2016 , Family,"Milpitas, California, United States ",Great place to see Moose,Must do this drive during the dusk and down time to see the moose and other wild life. Just a short drive and scenic too. Plan ahead if you are entering from the south side drive via Wilson town and continue to moose Wilson road that will merge into the moose junction. Moose are mostly found in the wet areas near creek or river.
234,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Family,"Margate, FL ",Great drive for wildlife,We drove about 1 mile in and there is a turnout on the left side of the road. Overview of a creek and a little marsh. There was a moose and a baby moose(2-3 weeks old).  We did not drive the entire road. We went about 5-6 miles. The road is mainly paved. It does get into a patch of gravel road. Views of meadows and woods. There are a couple of trails off the road.  this road kind of hugs the base of the south part of the Grand Tetons.
235,Moose-Wilson-Road,May 2016 , Couples,"Columbus, OH ",Scenic drive between Moose and Teton Village,This is a scenic drive between Moose and Teton Village. Many people drive it during dusk to look for wildlife. There are pull-outs along the way to stop and view. We saw a huge owl (don't know what kind) and a moose. I can definitely see how it is a good area for wildlife viewing. Part of the road is gravel and very bumpy and narrow. A good number of people were driving it doing the same thing we were. So bring your patience.
236,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Family,Iowa ,Nice drive...,"This was a nice drive on a day when I needed a rest from hiking...it's narrow in spots, and part of it is gravel. At one point we stopped because supposedly there was a moose mama and her calf nearby - we couldn't see them. We ended up swinging down through Jackson and then back up the main road."
237,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Dallas, TX ",Good chance to see moose,"narrow, some parts gravel road that goes from Moose to Wilson. Take you through some pretty good wetlands where moose usually hang out. Then on to Teton Village (closed in Winter) and down to Wilson."
238,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Family,"Tyler, TX ",Gorgeous,A beautiful side trip south off the west loop of 42 mile trail. Great views. Several nice river and mountain view pull outs.
239,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Friends,"Dallas, TX ",Keep Your Eyes on the Road,"While the opportunities to see wildlife while driving on this road are typically better than average, this is a very narrow, winding, partially unpaved road that the driver needs to keep his/her eyes on the road and leave the gawking to the passengers.  It's used to connect Teton Village with Moose and serves the locals as well as the tourists. There are those who know the road well, drive it at faster speeds, and are totally frustrated by the tourists who are focused on the scenery rather than getting someplace. Only when a tourist pulls over to the occasional wide spot in the road, can the local move ahead.  It's not unusual to see elk, mule deer or moose along the road in the spring plus bear in the fall, all of which cause animal jams, driving the locals crazy.  The road is closed in the winter and occasionally during the spring, summer and fall when the park service grades it. Even so, the potholes can be fierce and the washboarding teeth chattering. Just keep your eyes on the road."
240,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Family, ,Fittingly named if you want to see Moose,This has to be one of the best places between Yellowstone and Jackson to see Moose. Look right off the side of the road...typically around dusk and you'll find these beautiful giants feeding.
241,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Family,"Gainesville, FL ",Saw 3 Moose tonight,We left the Teton Village around 6:30pm tonight and went toward Jackson. Saw 3 moose on the drive home (2 eating next to a stream and 1 just laying next to the road). It was awesome. We're going to stop over again before we leave Jackson.
242,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Charlotte, NC ",Wonderful Mtn Rdt,"This road is narrow and only partially paved. Skip it - if your in a hurry , if not then drive slow take pictures and watch for bear, moose & deer. We saw moose. It's a wonderful nature drive that we did twice. Enjoy.  Will do it again because we loved it so much. Best time to see wildlife is early morning but drive very slow so you don't hit anything."
243,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Sutton-on-Sea, UK ",Great Country Road,Its a cute part paved road away from the main drag and its great. Lots of scenery and yes we saw a Moose too. Worth the effort.
244,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Orem, UT ",Usually buzzing with activity,We have been down Moose Wilson several times. Our 2 most recent trips are the only times we did not see wildlife on MW Road. The road is very narrow and not a lot of pull outs if you happen to see anything. There are ponds along the road that we have seen moose in and the birding is fantastic!
245,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",lovely forest road,Drive slowly. We saw a deer and a moose. Halfway down this road is the LSR Reserve (Rockfeller). Nice hikes there. A;omg the road are several stopping points for viewing.

248,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Quincy, FL ",Like ships in the night,"A beautiful little gravel road that is often bumpy. However one night in late September, we parked by the side of the road from dusk until total dark. The elk were coming down to the elk refuge from the high country. The bulls were bugling all over and the elk drifted across the road like ships in the night. We probably saw 75-80 in about 30 minutes. An experience of a lifetime for a flatlander from Florida."
249,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Fort Myers, FL ",awesome road for animal viewing,"rough road in spots, but really nice and peaceful. Spotted a mother moose and calf and watched them eat willows for a while."
250,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Napa Valley, CA ",Bumpy and busy,"This used to be a quiet road somewhat off the tourist track (where we actually saw moose) but this year it was practically bumper to bumper in early June. Part of the problem may be the popularity of the Laurence Rockefeller Preserve, which is located on the road. Blame it on overall increased tourism, but it's not so much fun anymore."
251,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Yokohama, Japan ",No need for 4x4!,"This road is unpaved and not very well maintained. It's bumpy, full of potholes and rocks but so beautiful and wild! I was a little worried since my rental car was a sedan. But by taking it slow and enjoying the scenery, I had no problem. Unfortunately, no moose on Moose Wilson Road that time."
252,Moose-Wilson-Road,May 2016 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ",Lives up to its name,"This road certainly lives up to its name. It is the only spot in either Grand Teton or Yellowstone where we saw some moose. It's a bit off the beaten path, but a great place to look for wildlife."
253,Moose-Wilson-Road,May 2016 , Couples,"Melbourne, Australia, ",Loved this,Yes there is a chance to see animals but the thing that I loved was the intimate feel of the road especially at the Moose end. Just 2 cars wide it feels like your in the heart of the mountains
254,Moose-Wilson-Road,Oct 2015 , Couples,"Oroville, CA ",We weren't disppointed...,"We drove this road several times during our visit and almost always saw moose and elk. Beautiful forest. Almost like a fairy tale. Road can be rough in spots, be careful not to drive too fast."
255,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Washington DC, DC, ",Early morning or before dusk for best wildlife viewing!,"I have traveled this road for 20 years and am never disappointed, unless the road is closed! This is a narrow road so no large RV's and such. Four wheel drive not needed. This road is great for wildlife viewing with good chance of seeing bear, moose, coyotes and much more. This road also gives you access to Death Canyon and Granite canyon trail heads. The Laurance S. Rockefeller preserve is also located on this road but if you want a parking spot there you need to arrive before 9 am because of very limited parking. Really a delightful drive that can be done in a 2 hours or less."
256,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Apopka, FL ",Moose Sighting,This is one area of the Tetons where you have your best chance of seeing moose. We saw a mother and two of her calves. Down the road from them we saw a black bear eating berries from a tree.
257,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Northamptonshire, UK ",Moose Loose In Moose,"If you are looking for a scenic drive where you may see moose, deer, elk or even a bear, then this road from Grand Teton to Moose is spectacular. It is not a drive to be taken in a hurry, apart from plenty of wildlife and the beautiful scenery to enjoy, the road itself is gravel in parts and very rough. Take it slow, roll down the window, smell the pine needles and enjoy one of the loveliest drives in the country."
258,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Greenville, TX ",Best place to see wildlife in Grand Teton Park,We highly recommend this road especially in the morning and just before sundown for seeing wildlife. We have seen bear in the past and frequently see a moose.

260,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015 , Family,"San Francisco, CA ",Finding Moose,"This is the place to see Moose. Their eating habitat is ideal on this road, especially closer to Moose (the little village). However, while there used to be about 1200 Moose in the area, today there are only about 300; so its rarer to see them; but this is the place."
261,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015,not available,"Oklahoma City, OK ",Go at Dusk and see lots of Black Bears!,"This place is phenomenal for viewing wildlife! It ended up being shut down the day after we left. There are so many places along the road to explore. The road connects Moose to Teton Village ""the back way"". There are trails all along the way and Phelps lake to explore as well. Everyday we went we say black bears.Every day. There are no shoulders on the roads but there are multiple pullouts to allow you to get out and explore. Here's the hint to see bears - look for trees that are shaking cuz there's bound to be a bear up there eating berries. I've include the cutest bear I saw the entire trip. Go at dusk and you'll have the greatest luck of seeing wildlife from the safety of your car. And stay in your car. Really."
262,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015,not available,"San Diego, CA ",Use at your own risk.,"A major part of this road is unpaved and very very rough. If you take this road right near the visitors center at GTP park to Teton village it is not paved. Unfortunately for us the map on my cell phone sent us down this road. Once we went a few miles we debated whether to turn around, but we just kept going until we reached Teton Village. Once we discovered there was another way to get to our condo, we used the longer, safer way through Jackson to Hwy 22 and north on the paved part of this road."
263,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Green Bay, WI ",Back to nature,"Rental cars not recommended on this road. Yes, this road is pretty rough. As it should be to keep speed to a minimum. It is as beautiful as any road gets. Definitely should be traveled at dawn or dusk to view abundant wildlife."
264,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Kissimmee, FL ",Great access road to GTNP and wildlife,This road connects the Moose entrance to the Wilson entrance of the GTNP thus the name. Almost a single lane road the pace is slow. That's ok as this area is rich with wildlife and views. You access the Lawrence Rockefeller Preserve via this road. Two other great trailheads are also along the way. The Wilson side has a stretch of unpaved road that is VERY rough. Drive slow and avoid pot holes.
265,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015 , Couples, ,"Great drive, worth the potholes","We read the reviews and decided to take this road into the park. It's a little rough with quiet a few potholes and we were in a rental and sis just fine. It's quiet and very peaceful. We didn't see any moose and enjoyed the drive anyway. I recommend stopping at the first scenic turnout that over looks a marsh and taking the flat hike along the river. We took the trail closest to the edge of the road so we could spot wildlife. We still didn't t see moose, but on the way back spotted a mountain lion along the tree line. This was the best hike ever!!!!"
266,Moose-Wilson-Road,Sep 2015 , Business,"Jackson, WY, ",Magical,"I first traveled this road in August 1980. I was amazed. Why was I living in Casper, Wyoming, when there is a green corner in Wyoming like this? Since then, the rest of the area has opened up to me, but I will always remember my first impressions. A year ago my daughter and I went up Death Canyon from here. Have been enjoying bears on it lately. But please slow down, and be aware that the best animal viewing will be at dusk or dawn. And please be patient with the Park service who occasionally restricts access for the sake of preserving resources. This is a treasure. We cherish it."
267,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2015 , Family, ,"Drive carefully, watch for wildlife.","A beautiful ride from Moose Junction (or Moose) to Wilson. There is a high chance of seeing wildlife on this road, especially in the early morning. We saw three moose while driving through. Please be careful as the road is narrow. Be nice to the park rangers that are trying to keep traffic moving and still allow you to take pictures. The Park Service will be friendly but local law enforcement will not tolerate bad behavior. Tickets for bad parking or speeding must be adjudicated IN PERSON, so if you get caught, you will need to travel back to beautiful Wyoming to straighten out your mess. Be courteous and drive carefully. The Laurence Rockefeller estate on this road is a great place to stop for hikes into the wilderness (e.g. Phelps Lake)."
268,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2015 , Friends, ,Most amazing drive,Beautiful and excellent drive to see amazing scenery and wildlife. Lots of places to stop for wonderful views and photography.
269,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2015 , Couples,"Birmingham, AL ",Best place to see wildlife,"Absolutely a road to check out for easy access to viewing the wildlife ; moose ,bears, elk, deer, birds even a porcupine . And there are always people at the first overlook with spotting scopes that will gladly share a view . Of course daybreak and late afternoon are the best times but you can usually see something on this road no matter what time . We encountered the same young male moose laying around in same spot several days in a row. And a young black bear seems to hang around their also . He ran right behind us on the little trail off to the right of parking lot ,which is where the young bull moose hangs out too . We always resort to checking out this road when I want to get some pictures ."

271,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2015 , Family,"Mount Sinai, NY ",Love this road!,This is one of my favorite roads in the park. Very scenic and abundant wildlife. On our last trip not only did we see plenty of moose but we were fortunate enough to see some black bears. Highly recommended.

At both occassions I didn't see any moose there. Once a big owl. Driving on there is a chance you will see moose. The first time we saw several and also beavers. The second time we saw nothing.
273,Moose-Wilson-Road,Aug 2015 , Friends,"Jackson, WY ",Beautiful ride into Nature!,"This road is spectacular in the summer or fall. You can see plenty of wildlife if you are lucky... Just roll down the windows and smell the pine needles! Lovely smells!! My favorite spot is the bridge with the moving stream. Nothing like the sound of water. You can use this road to get to Moose from Teton Village. (Or you can get to Teton Village from Moose.) Please don't use this road as a short cut! If you think you can go speeding down this road you will be very sorry. Part of it is gravel and very rough. When you get to the asphalt, it doesn't mean speed up to 55 mph. Many people on this road are just enjoying the ride, not the destination. Slow down and enjoy!!"

277,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2015 , Family,"Atlanta, GA ","Interesting drive, but careful when you leave your auto",A nice drive seasonal drive between Grand Teton Park and the Jackson Hole Ski Area. Closed during winter and frequently when bears frequent the area.
278,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jul 2015 , Family,"Suffield, CT ",Nice drive through the forest,First let me tell you that the park map defines part of the road as a dirt road recommended for 4 wheel drives. We had a Chrysler 200 rental and it was fine. It would not be good for large vehicles like RV's. We started at the Moose side and the road is right after the Craig Thomas Visitor Center on the left before the main entrance gate to the park. The road is paved for a portion and there is a turnoff overlook you can stop to see if there were any moose. We saw a number of people and cars at the stop and thought maybe we would see a moose but instead they were taking picture of a Great gray Owl which was also cool. I think most people turn around and don't continue further down the road. We continued and after a short period the road turned into a gravel road. We drove it slow to see if we can see animals along the way and we did see some Blacktail Deer but no bears or Moose this time. The thing to be careful here is to take it slow and watch for any big potholes but most of the road was fine. When toy drive through you wind up in the Teton Village area. We drove through in the afternoon but earlier in the morning or later at night would probably be better to see more animals.
279,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Galveston, TX ",Good Place for Moose Sitings,"We took this road several times. The first time through we were caught in a moose jam because two moose were standing in the road. However, we didn't get to see them because cars were just stopped and it is a very narrow dirt road with no way to get off to the side if there is traffic in both directions.  The next morning we went back and got some great pictures of the mama and baby moose laying in the shade of some trees. We were able to pull over, as had several other people, so everyone could get pictures. On another trip we got great pictures of a small male mule deer right at the side of the road.  Be prepared for narrow passing areas and folks going faster than you want to go. It seems to be a shortcut for locals going from the Moose area to Grand Teton and Jackson. I just let them pass me where I could so I could drive slow enough to see animals off to the side of the road and also keep from damaging the rental car since you wouldn't want to be flinging rocks up under your wheels. When you come out on the north end of the road you are right at a river viewing area known for great grey owl sightings. The Murie Center, which gives you the history of the founding of Grand Teton National Park, is on that same road as is the Rockefeller Preserve Center."

282,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2015 , Friends,"Midlothian, VA ",Awesome Moose Jams,"We missed seeing any moose in Yellowstone, but were thrilled to see mama and baby moose several times as we traveled the road to and from our rental home and different activities. The marshy area is really a haven for moose and elk. We saw a baby moose walking down the road. Great photo opportunities! We saw the largest herd of elk during our stay as well on this road! It is closed during the winter months, so please check with the visitor centers to ensure it is open."
283,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2015 , Family,"Zionsville, IN ",Great dusk drive! Like a National Park Safari,"We have visited Grand Teton National Park twice staying in Teton Village both times. Both times, at dusk we would head into the park on Moose Wilson Road to see wildlife. We have never been disappointed. Last night we saw a mother moose and her youngster within feet of our car. We also saw many mule deer and elk. The kids of all ages have really enjoyed the opportunity to slowly cruise through the area looking for wildlife. Definitely recommend."
284,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Blythewood, SC ",Moose!,"Yes part of the road is dirt, but they just graded the road June 9th and most of the potholes are gone (for now!). We saw at least one moose each time we drove down this road going to and from our hotel (Hotel Terra in Teton Village) to Grand Teton and Yellowstone NP. Look for moose in the large pull out area (can hold about 8-9 cars easily) there is a small pond in the little valley. Wish we had seen bears here too, but only saw them in YNP."
285,Moose-Wilson-Road,Jun 2015 , Couples,"San Rafael, CA, ","Yes, it's a dirt road...so what?","You really have to take this road if you are staying in Teton Village and going to Grand Teton NP. I've noticed that most people that drive it have no idea how to drive on a dirt road and are freaked out. You can tell the locals because they go FAST!! Actually, the dirt portion is only a couple of miles long and is graded once per year, but other times there can be some bumps. There are a couple of good trail heads along the way, Granite Canyon and Phelps Lake to name two."
286,Moose-Wilson-Road,May 2015 , Couples,"Hatboro, PA ",Nice drive if you like potholes!,"We took this Road from Grand Teton Village after going up on the Tram to Rendevous Mt. to the end at the Moose Visitor Center. To be quite honest, the drive didn't show you much along the way, and the vast portion of it is not smoothly paved and you are dodging potholes all the time - sometimes very large potholes. If the sites along the way were better, I'd have rated it higher, but keeping your eyes on the road and your nerves in tact took all our energy."
287,Moose-Wilson-Road,May 2014 , Friends,"Tagaytay, Philippines, ",Comfortable Drive when driven slowly,Go slow and enjoy the view. There are some homes along the way that appreciate your slow steady pace so the dust does not cover their homes. Traveling in the early morning or late afternoon offered us the best view of the wildlife grazing or on the move. The other drivers we met were very polite.
