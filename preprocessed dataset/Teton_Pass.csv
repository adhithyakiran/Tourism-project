0,Teton_Pass,Dec 2021 , Couples,"St. Petersburg, FL ",Check road conditions and weather!,"We were driving from Alta to Jackson this December and I followed my GPS which sent us to the Teton pass. Very difficult drive with snow on the road, high winds with blowing snow at the top of the mountain, zero visibility at times. I’ve never been more nervous driving! My fault for blindly following my GPS, but I would not make that drive again in winter! I would find a different route even if it took a lot longer."
1,Teton_Pass,Jun 2021,not available,"Riverside, CA ",Nice grade and cures well banked!,"What a beautiful entry from Idaho down into Jackson Hole!! Beautiful overview of many mountain ranges and the whole valley - but don't look and drive. There are a few pull overs for viewing. So many of the locals that live in Idaho and work in Jackson drive this in the winter - I can't imagine, then again I don't do much snow driving!!"
2,Teton_Pass,Jun 2021,not available,"Middletown, DE ",Great Views!!,We rode over the Pass on our way to dinner in Idaho one evening. We planned it so we could take this drive. The views are awesome. There are some pull-offs so you can take photos.
3,Teton_Pass,May 2021 , Couples,"Albany, NY ",Scary,Beautiful views yes! However scary steep curvy hills not worth the anxiety panic attacks if you hate heights like me. Drivers had on the breaks most of the time
4,Teton_Pass,May 2021,not available,"Midway, PA ",What a view at the top!,"It's really a fun drive up the Teton Pass...it's steep and windy most of the way, but it's an adventure. The views are amazing!"
5,Teton_Pass,Sep 2020,not available,"Alpharetta, GA, ",Fun Drive,"We returned to Jackson from Idaho thru this pass. It was quite a drive; on par with the Beartooth Highway west of Yellowstone, and the Going to the Sun Road in Glacier.    Great Views, including some of the Tetons    Tight switchbacks and curves, some of them very steep, make this a fun road to drive if you are the right vehicle."
6,Teton_Pass,Jul 2020,not available,"York, SC ",Super views,Beautiful views. We went from Jackson where we were vacationing through this pass on the way to visit Idaho just for the day. Driving up the mountain and back down again showcased such great mountain views.
7,Teton_Pass,Jul 2019,not available, ,PERFECT VIEW,"Stop and take a picture, it is worth it. It looks back over the teton village. Narrow fun road with gorgeous view"
8,Teton_Pass,Nov 2019 , Business,"Memphis, TN ",Beautiful Must See,"I visited Jackson Hole , Wy on business this month. Jackson Hole is a beautiful, quaint, historic little village that has something for everyone. Great restaurants, shopping, and even more beautiful scenery. The Teton Pass is a bit scary to drive with really sharp switchbacks and a 20 mile per hour speed limit on the curves but worth the drive"
9,Teton_Pass,Aug 2019,not available,"Centreville, United States ",Teton Pass,Breathtaking drive that is a short distance from Jackson. Great views and will not take too much time!
10,Teton_Pass,Aug 2019 , Friends,"Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, ",Beautiful Drive,We came in Summer so no snow on the ground so an easy drive. I would just say fill up on gas in Victor Idaho if you are coming from Yellowstone. Pretty drive and use low gears going down the other side. No pics as I was driving!
11,Teton_Pass,Jul 2019 , Couples,"Joensuu, Finland, ",Great views,"Great views. The road is n't that bad to drive, at least in summer time. Great photo opportunies at the road."
12,Teton_Pass,Jul 2019 , Family,"Bozeman, MT ",I was the driver..,I don’t think this was so bad? I am a nervous nelly and It was my first day driving a large suv rental car but it was not nerve wracking. Some beautiful turnouts to take a break and enjoy the views. We did this as an alternative route from Jackson Hole to Bozeman via West Yellowstone. Smooth driving.
13,Teton_Pass,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",Unbelievable Views,We were leaving the GTNP area and driving to West Yellowstone area. This drive is no joke. It is steep. The views are gorgeous and we wish we would have had an excuse to go over it again to enjoy more views. These kinds of passes always makes me wonder how these were ever built...just amazing.
14,Teton_Pass,Jun 2019 , Solo,"St. Augustine, FL ",America the Beautiful!,"The pass is awesome and got us to Teton Village to paraglide in 30 min., all breathtakingly beautiful. Jackson was so crowded we just went thru and got back to peaceful Victor, Idaho. (Had been to Jackson on a previous trip). Also went over Hoback pass, which is also a beautiful scenic ride."
15,Teton_Pass,Jun 2019 , Family,"Charlotte, NC, ","Easy roads, beautiful views","We drove the Teton Pass everyday from Victor, and I can say, in the summer it's an easy drive, despite the steep incline. In the winter, crews are quick to keep the pass clear, and the pass offers beautiful mountain views and turnouts for photos along the way."
16,Teton_Pass,Jun 2019 , Family,"Houston, TX ",Rode All the Lifts in the Summer--Nice Views,"The Village at Teton Pass in the summer does not have a lot to do like some resorts, but going on-line and getting a discounted passes allowed us to ride the 3 lifts they have a the Village and look at the scenery. Of course the view from the top of the mountain is impressive, after that the scenery from the other two lifts is fine, but does not compare.  The mountain bike course looks interesting, but it is only for those serious about the sport and we did not have the time to sign up for class or bring the equipment and bike needed.  All in all, it was a nice stop before we went into the town of Jackson, WY and we were glad we did, but this is not Aspen in the summer."
17,Teton_Pass,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Surprise, AZ ",Steep drive with spectacular views (if you can take your eyes off the road),We made four trips across the pass during our stay in the Teton area. Three of them were pretty frustrating; when you get behind a driver who doesn't know how to drive in mountains it is not fun. The fourth time we had good drivers and it was a wonderful drive. The scenery is spectacular and the road is sort of fun - twisting curves and uphills and downhills. But we were glad to see the last of it!
18,Teton_Pass,Mar 2019,not available,"Ann Arbor, MI ",Outstanding adventure,Ski vacation. Took a day off and went on a Ranger guided snowshoe tour (free) of the Tetons. Worth every penny!
19,Teton_Pass,Mar 2019 , Family,"Fort Collins, CO ","Beaut views, awesome skiing",Very popular spot for locals to get their powder fix. Beware that the pass may close after heavy snowfall for avalanche mitagation. Worth the drive over to Idaho to check out the views of tetons from both Wyo and Idaho side!
20,Teton_Pass,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Reading, UK ",Up High,This is a really steep drive up to the Pass which fun. Great views from the top and a rather cute Howdy sign too.
21,Teton_Pass,Feb 2019 , Friends,"Sioux City, IA ","For back country skiing and views to die for, this is the pass.","Drove over the pass several times during the week I was at Jackson Hole. There were lots of back country skiers and snow mobilers with parking available on both sides of the pass. As with any pass, conditions can change and the pass was closed both ways for over 12 hours one day. The views are great and if you get to Victor, Idaho take time to stop at the emporium for a shake or another treat. Make sure your car is road ready."
22,Teton_Pass,Jan 2019 , Friends,"Ozark, MO ","Views, views and more views!",Take the drive in or out of Jackson Hole! It's easy to navigate and we'll paved.    There are plenty of pullouts to get those opportunistic photos.
23,Teton_Pass,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Tri-Cities, WA ",Big climb = Big views,The pass is a big climb 10% grade .... but the views are impressive. You can over look Jackson hole Wyoming.
24,Teton_Pass,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Greenville, SC ",Breathtaking!,Every citizen of this country should visit this park once in their lifetime. Be sure to hike to Hidden Falls and Lower Inspiration Point. The Jenny Lake shuttle boat will save you some steps.
25,Teton_Pass,Sep 2018 , Solo,Wisconsin ,Airstreaming the Teton Pass,Awesome scenery. Was constantly tailgated followed by a burst of speed to pass.Why the hurry? Why not enjoy the great views and just take it easy?    Mv
26,Teton_Pass,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",Annual Pass,Highly recommend getting the annual pass for all national parks. It’s only $80 will get you into Teton and Yellowstone. Only $10 more if you are getting both passes individually.
27,Teton_Pass,Aug 2018 , Couples,"Cocoa Beach, FL ",Nice Drive - Great Mountain Views,"We made a loop one day from Jackson Hole over Teton Pass, through Victor, ID, and down through Swan Valley stopping for a picnic on the Snake River at one of the many boat ramps (the one we chose even had a picnic table.) This is a nice meandering drive with lots of viewpoints, good picnic areas, and plenty of hiking trails. It's a good place to get away and just enjoy nature for a day."
28,Teton_Pass,Aug 2018 , Couples, ,On our drive through to Jackson Hole.,"We drove from Mt. Rushmore through the Tetons seeing snow on them in August. We passed through the Continental Divide at 9,600 feet and were amazed at the height of the tallest at 13,000 feet. Wonderful!!"
29,Teton_Pass,Jul 2018 , Couples,Alabama ,WOW what a view,"We took the Teton Pass from Jackson to Idaho Falls, ID. The views were incredible!! I was driving and it was actually rather fun driving the curves. If you don't like heights the drive may bother you but it so worth doing it. Spectacular views all the way, some places to pull out. A totally enjoyable experience and such a delight to the eye and mind. Don't miss this drive!"
30,Teton_Pass,Jul 2018 , Family,"Clinton, NJ ",Don't Miss it!,"We drove through the Teton Pass from Idaho Falls into Jackson, Wyoming. What a great way to start our vacation. The scenery was spectacular and the ride in the summer was like any mountain road. We watched a Utube video before we left since some of the posted reviews made the pass seem dangerous. This is not the case and I suggest taking the Teton Pass into Jackson Wyoming. This is not to be missed!"
31,Teton_Pass,Jul 2018 , Family,"Omaha, NE ",Beautiful but somewhat difficult drive,We went through Teton Pass when we left Jackson for Boise. We left Jackson at 5:30 am so we got to see sunrise from the top. We also saw a moose eating right next to the road at the top as well as a coyote crossing the road. It was a narrow two lane road with many tight curves. It is definitely the fastest way to get across the Tetons. There really is not much on the western side of the pass until you reach Idaho Falls.
32,Teton_Pass,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Huntsville, AL ",Awesomel Scenery,"Take a drive through Teton Pass which is WY 22 and ID 33 for some awesome scenery. Just be aware that the elevation is steep so make sure your vehicle is in good shape, especially brakes."
33,Teton_Pass,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Ringgold, GA ",Beautiful drive!,"What a beautiful drive! This is one of only three ways into Jackson, and the view is spectacular but steep. Use a lower gear going down."
34,Teton_Pass,Jun 2018 , Couples,"Memphis, TN ",Great drive,"We took a few hours to drive into Idaho and see the west side of the Tetons. This is a beautiful drive. Stopped in Victor, Idaho for gas and a snack. Typical western town in many ways. On the way back be prepared to stop to take in the views of the Jackson Hole valley. Be prepared to drive on the side of the slopes as you head back to JH. If you are not an experienced mountain road driver, it will take some adjustment but there are guardrails and plenty of shoulder to help you with perspective (plus there are many turn-offs you can take and let people go by!). This is a nice road trip."
35,Teton_Pass,Jul 2017 , Family,"Caledonia, MS ",BEAUTIFUL!!!,This was beautiful to see in the summer as snow was still everywhere and from Mississippi we hardly ever see snow! So pretty!
36,Teton_Pass,Jun 2018 , Solo,"Washington DC, DC ",Anxiety-ridden death drive,"This is an attraction? I was terrified the entire time on this road and felt myself getting a panic attack. If you appreciate 20 minutes of clenched muscles and severe anxiety, go for it. Not for the faint of heart or neurotic east coast drivers."
37,Teton_Pass,May 2018 , Couples,"Chandler, AZ ",Awesome Views,We love to travel off season when we can avoid the crowds. May is the perfect time to enjoy the scenery and the weather is not too cold but still has plenty of snow to be found.
38,Teton_Pass,Oct 2017 , Couples,"Korora, Australia, ",West Yellowstone to Jackson Hole,"Because of inclement weather we used this road and the Pass to go from West Yellowstone to Teton /Jackson.  A lovely drive with Autumn colours up to Victor, although going over the Pass was snowing, even in October.  Not a trip if in a hurry!"
39,Teton_Pass,Aug 2017 , Family,"Newark, DE ",Stunning Drive,"This highway crosses a pass in the Tetons that separate Wyoming and Idaho. It is a stunning drive, I highly recommend it."
40,Teton_Pass,Jan 2018 , Family, ,Gorgeous,"Take this drive alk the way to Rainey creek in Idaho and then navigate to Cress Creek Nature trail. The most beautiful drive I have ever been on. I am in love with Wydaho after this.    The drives to Signal Lodge, Togwotee Pass and through the Wind River reservation were also stunning."
41,Teton_Pass,Jun 2017 , Couples,"Grand Junction, CO ",Beautiful Drive and Overlooks,"We took this drive from Teton Village to go into Idaho during the summer. It was splendid with great pull outs for overlooks and hiking. Definitely worth it if you enjoy driving through mountains and scenic views. If you have multiple drivers and will be going through the pass twice, I recommend changing drivers so everyone can take in the sights safely."
42,Teton_Pass,Nov 2017 , Family,"Grayslake, IL ",Awesome drive over the mountains,Super drive through the mountains. A little slippery and a steep drop into Idaho but an exciting adventure. Several pull outs for scenic views.
43,Teton_Pass,Nov 2017,not available,"Chicago, IL ","Beautiful drive, but focus on the road","You can easily get caught staring at the views, but this road is no joke. My small car even had trouble slowing down on the steep hills, so make sure to pay attention."
44,Teton_Pass,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Clinton, OH ",Scary,"It appears that the highway folks do an awesome job of maintaining this pass. There was snow on the apron and the road was wet and there was signs of ""grits"" on the road, so I imagine as the season progresses that salt will be added. Views were spectacular in spite of the rain/sleet and snow."
45,Teton_Pass,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Rockford, IL ",Simply beautiful,Breathtaking scenes around every curve and bend. Take the time to drive through this area and just soak in the beauty of nature.
46,Teton_Pass,Aug 2017 , Couples,"Vancouver, WA, ",Highway 22.,"When we asked at the visitor center along highway 191 where the beginning of highway 22 was in Jackson, the lady said she closed her eyes every time she was a passenger when her husband drove here.  It's steep, it has sharp curves, it has drop offs. It's one of those old roads that hugs a mountainside. Views are fantastic. Watch your speed going down. Be sure your brakes work properly!"
47,Teton_Pass,Aug 2017 , Friends,"Kellyville, OK, ",Great Views,"The pass is a few miles out of town. The drive up is pretty with curves and a steep grade. There is not a sign at the pass, so it's easy to miss. The views are great from the pass. There are hiking trails from here too."
48,Teton_Pass,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Westbrook, ME ",10% Grade,This is a steep pass but it is a easier drive than most of the other mountain roads we have driven. There are some very nice views but not on the same level as some of the views you will see in the National Parks.
49,Teton_Pass,Jun 2017 , Friends,"Teton Village, WY ",Stunning - in all seasons!,"If in the area, have to see. Easily accessed hiking trails right off the Pass, even ones bootpack before skiing/boarding down Glory Bowl and other nearby areas. Tough to get parking spot in winter, but awesome view of Jackson Hole can still be seen."
50,Teton_Pass,Jul 2017 , Couples,"Kewaskum, WI ",The pass on a Harley,"We rode our Road king all over the area but one of the better rides was over the pass, nice twisty roads in good shape."
51,Teton_Pass,Jul 2017 , Family,"Olive Branch, MS ",Visiting Jenny Lake area,We visited the visitors center for great history of the town of Jackson Hole... We hiked and had lunch at Jenny Lake and saw the beautiful Hidden waterfall... The pass was the best place to see live animals ....!!!!!
52,Teton_Pass,Jul 2017 , Business,"Cincinnati, Ohio ",Nice drive with amazing views!,Beautiful scenery as you wind your way through the pass. 10% grade so could get slow if you get stuck behind a truck. Be sure to pull off in the designated places to take in the scenery...you won't be disappointed!
53,Teton_Pass,Jun 2017 , Family, ,Nice drive,"We needed to cross the pass so we could take a day trip to Idaho during our stay in Jackson. It was steep and curvy, but manageable. We stopped near the top for some the great views. Drove cautiously."
54,Teton_Pass,Jun 2017 , Family,"Seattle, WA ",A beautiful hairy drive between Idaho and Wyoming,This is a stunning way to get to the National Parks. It is a very steep grade. Not a lot of places to pull off for photos though.
55,Teton_Pass,May 2017 , Solo,"Vancouver Island, Canada ",Curvy,I did the Teton Pass so I could enter Idaho. Curvy at times and bad if you are behind a truck. Snow all around. There was a snowboarder enjoying the area. Nice views since it's high up.
56,Teton_Pass,May 2017 , Family,"Berlin, Germany ",Adventures connection Idaho Falls - Jackson,"I was planning to drive different route (through Alpine) but our GPS suggested this one from Idaho Falls to Jackson WY. Great adventure, check your breaks before you go and stronger engine is recommended :) It was great to see the town of Jackson and the Jackson Hole valley from the pass. Area was covered with snow. Great beginning of our vacation. The kids were trilled if our renter car will make it. Definitely don't forget to use the lower gearshift to break."
57,Teton_Pass,May 2017 , Couples,"Fernandina Beach, FL ",Beautiful Valley Views,"If you take this short ride, you must stop at the top to appreciate the view of Jackson Hole with the surrounding mountains.  I am incredibly scared of heights and wouldn't want to do it again, but I'm glad we went. It has a 10% grade on the way down.  When you cross into Idaho it's definitely a different neighborhood. There is nothing touristy about it and not much to do. We were told by someone in Jackson Hole that is where the workers live because they can't afford the rent in Jackson.  Drive the Teton Pass. Tthe views are breathtaking!"
58,Teton_Pass,May 2017 , Family,"Manchester, CT ",Hotel Terra,This hotel was a great place to relax at the end of the day after visiting either the Teton or Yellowstone National Parks.
59,Teton_Pass,Apr 2017 , Couples,"Nakusp, Canada ",Amazing views of Jackson!,This is an amazingly scenic region on a very steep and winding road! You must drive with caution as it has sharp curves and a 10% grade both climbing and descending. The view of Jackson and the whole valley is wonderful and worth checking out! Loved the drive!
60,Teton_Pass,Feb 2017 , Family,"Stockholm, Sweden, ",Just make sure you have a winter equipped car,"Impressive views, however, very dependent on what the weather offers.But even on a cloudy day, you get a sense of how powerful this mountain range is"
61,Teton_Pass,Jun 2016 , Couples,"Wishaw, UK ",Breathtaking,"The scenery is fabulous, huge wide open spaces surrounded by majestic snow capped mountains and clean, fresh air. Loved it."
62,Teton_Pass,Jan 2017 , Couples,"Calgary, Canada ",WOW. What a mountain,"""There are no friends on powder days"". I was a powder widow the first day...too steep and too much snow for me to keep up. Lots of groomers to keep me smiling. Huge mountain"
63,Teton_Pass,Sep 2016,not available,"Signal Mountain, Tennessee ",fantastic views,"If you want great views accessible by car, give yourself time to stop on the pass in one of the large pull-off spots. In winter you may see several people hitchhiking up the hill after snowboarding in non-designated areas. Any time of year is a wonderful time to take in the breathtaking view. Get your camera ready!"
64,Teton_Pass,Oct 2016 , Solo,"Tampa, FL ",Super Fun Drive,I drove the Teton Pass from Wyoming to Idaho. It was terribly fun and scenic.    The grade of the road is very steep. You need to know how to drive in the mountains or you'll burn out your breaks. If you have a passenger that is scared of heights they should sit accordingly.
65,Teton_Pass,Sep 2016 , Couples,orlando ,Wow! Must like heights,We had to take this pass due to Southern entrance of Yelliwstone closed due to fires. But it ended up being worth the extra hour to West Entrance. Just beautiful. Very high. One of the passengers with us kept looking away from the cliffs so if height bothers you dont sit on the side with awesome views. Take your time and enjoy the beauty!
66,Teton_Pass,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Idaho Falls, ID ","Beautiful drive through high country; possibly a fun drive as well, depending on your car","This is the main roadway from Teton Valley Idaho to Jackson, Wyoming. It's used by hundreds of commuters every day as well as tourists and business travelers. It's a nice opportunity to use the paddle shifters on your car and test your ability to descend without overusing your brakes. Wildlife is off the road and sometimes you'll see an elk or deer running down the middle of the road as you turn on a switchback. Stop at the top and take a picture if you're visiting; the views are magnificent."
67,Teton_Pass,Oct 2016 , Couples,"Leland, NC ",Beautiful views!,The views were gorgeous from the top of the mountain. The leaves were starting to change on the Aspins and Cottonwood trees and created an opportunity for some great photos.
68,Teton_Pass,Oct 2016 , Solo, ,An amazing place to visit.,Right here in our own United States what a beautiful place. I travel often and like to see the outdoor beauty of this country and was not disappointed. Among the beautiful places in the US I have been I rate this in the top 3 with Alaska owning the number one spot and the Beartooth Mountain Range in 2nd. Absolutely a must see and I will be going back.
69,Teton_Pass,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Clarksville, VA ",Gorgeous views,There were many gorgeous views on our trip throug the Teton pass. There were some very steep roadways and we our brakes were smoking when we reach the bottom of the mountain. Had to drive several miles to cool them off. Be careful
70,Teton_Pass,Sep 2016 , Friends,"Milton, MA ",Very tricky driving,"We drove the pass at night, in bad rain and then the fog came and then the deer crossing signs! It mostly a 10% grade which is very steep."
71,Teton_Pass,Jun 2016 , Family, ,Love this rock pile!,"Whether skiing in the winter or hiking in the summer, the Tetons are a marvelous playground. And the best kept secret for beginner skiiers/boarders is how affordable Jackson resort is! See, 90% of that mountain is blue and black runs, however there are 2 lifts that access green and some blue runs. Those lifts are really discounted (like $10 in 2015!) which makes this place just an awesome place to teach your kids to ski/ride. And those runs are filled with fun things to do like the teepee, runs through the trees. And one year we were there, they had sculpted a most excellent sled run for that our boys took advantage of when they were 'done' with trying to ride the slopes."
72,Teton_Pass,Sep 2016 , Family,North Carolina ,Good Highway through Mountains,"After having driven the road between Canyon Village and Tower Roosevelt in Yellowstone, we were nervous about going on the Teton Pass and asked a couple of park rangers about it, and then looked at the road online. It's a very easy drive, especially if you're traveling from Wyoming to Idaho where you're on the inside next to the mountain almost the whole time. There are guardrails if you're on the outside in all the spots we noticed that might be scary. Shoulders are ample also."
73,Teton_Pass,Aug 2016 , Friends,"Fort Worth, Texas ",The Pass,"I am sure it is spectacular with snow on the mountains, but the summer views were gorgeous coming back into Jackson from the Idaho side."
74,Teton_Pass,Aug 2016 , Friends,"Boca Raton, FL ",Spectacular views,"Teton pass is driver friendly. The road is wide and the guardrails reassuring. I'm told it's no picnic in the winter, but I'm not about to give it a try. Easy ride up to the top for beautiful views of the valley and wonderful walking trails. Ample parking at the summit.  Great drive from Jackson over to Idaho and the Star Valley and other Idaho wonders."
75,Teton_Pass,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Kingston, MA ",Stop to take in the view,There is a breath-taking view at the top of the pass. Going down the other side of the pass requires a steady hand and slowing your car down.
76,Teton_Pass,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Awesome view!,"Great view from the summit pass looking down on the vallley and Wilson, WY below. A must stop for the photo opportunity!"
77,Teton_Pass,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Northbrook, IL ",Easy Drive,Great scenery on an easy drive. Make sure you are in 1st or 2nd gear coming down. Go over to Vivtory and then The Grand Targhee Ski Resort for graet views of the west side of the Grand Teton. It a spectacular car ride and worth the time.
78,Teton_Pass,Aug 2016,not available,"Temple, Pa, United States ",Quite a climb,"Beautiful area, but may not be the best for large motor homes as we have actually had to turn around bevcuse the transmission was overheating"
79,Teton_Pass,Aug 2016 , Family,"Wichita, KS ",Easy or hard trails - you pick,Park at the pass and decide what your group is up for. Glory Mountain is 1500 feet of vertical in one mile - whew! But it offers a 360 degree view of the entire area. The other side you go as far as you feel like to look down on Jackson and the valley. Highly recommend.
80,Teton_Pass,Jul 2016 , Family,"Palm Bay, FL ",Hiked a short distance through beautiful wildflowers.,This is the place to view Jackson just below. Nice easy hiking trails. Large parking lot with maps showing different routes and a history lesson as well.
81,Teton_Pass,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Natural beauty at its best,Purely wonderful views and vistas along the drive through the pass to bridge the Idaho side of the Tetons to the Wyoming side. Enjoy the climb and the scenery on the way down.
82,Teton_Pass,Jun 2016 , Family,"Austin, TX ",Still had snow on the hiking trails in early June!,"My daughter and I are Texans, and we were driving through here on the way to the Grand Tetons. My daughter had fallen asleep and I pulled over at Teton Pass and asked her if she wanted to get out and hike around with me. She very sleepily said ""no"". I asked, ""Are you sure you want to miss playing in snow?"" There was a pause and she opened her eyes and said, ""WHHAAATT??"" We both jumped out of car and proceeded to build a snowman, have a snowball fight and generally have the best hiking stop ever."
83,Teton_Pass,Feb 2016 , Couples,los angeles ,Worth the drive,Worth the drive up to get some nice views of the valley. you can also snowshoe around the top. Just watch out of the yellow snow!
84,Teton_Pass,Feb 2016 , Family,"West Concord, Minnesota ",driving over the pass,"you are driving in the Teton national park, please observe speed limit, The road is maintained very well, good winter driving, best to do in day light"
85,Teton_Pass,Jan 2016 , Solo,Columbia ,Mt Glory backcountry skiing,"Had and outstanding time skiing the Teton backcountry off Mt Glory. It was a 90 min boot pack up the ridge to the top, about 1,700 feet above the pass. Nice igloo for putting on warm layers then the ski down. My tour was through Yostmark Backcountry Tours out of Driggs ID. I am super grateful to my guide Matt Lloyd. This is my 3rd trip with him and he knows how to set the pace for the climb/skin up and the ski down. He really allows me to get the most out of the tour while staying safe. Can't wait to do it again."
86,Teton_Pass,Jan 2016 , Business,"Jackson, WY, ",Superb!,"I'm sad to admit it has been years since I have telemark skied here but there exists bowl after bowl of pristine back country terrain for your most enthusiastic of snow lovers. Also, it is the way to get to Pierre's Hole and grand Targhee resort, so I take this road often. And, in the summer it is a joy to access the Targhee National Forest is well. Please be cautious however, there are many commuters on this road and sometimes it is slick and it is a 10% grade. That being said, it is a gateway to wonder."
87,Teton_Pass,Aug 2015 , Family,"Longmont, CO ",Fun Drive!,"This was a fun drive in the summer time. We saw moose, deer, and elk. The views are spectacular, drive was nice, as long as we didn't end up behind a semi-trailer. There are no passing lanes, so if you get caught behind a slow vehicle, you are pretty much stuck."
88,Teton_Pass,Dec 2015 , Family,"Quakertown, PA ",Nice trip,The can be treacherous pass is beautiful if you can navigate it. If you take it slow you shouldn't have a problem in a 4x4 vehicle as we did. Take the ride through even if you don't have a destination on the other side.
89,Teton_Pass,Dec 2015 , Family,"Naples, FL ",Beautiful area,"Beautiful area, don't let the car rental places scare you into only being able to use 4 wheel drive vehicles. Yes, it's high and somewhat difficult when covered in snow or if you get caught in a snowstorm, but reasonably easy to get through with any vehicle.    Be careful for wildlife, we almost hit a giant Moose, it was right on the road around at night."
90,Teton_Pass,Dec 2015 , Couples,"DeWitt, IA ",Stunning views! great skiing!,"This is my first trip to Jackson Hole and I LOVE it! My husband has been here several times before and he still finds new things to do here. I am good skier for an Iowan, but i was able to find LOTS of runs that were feasible. A great time for singles, couples, or families!"
91,Teton_Pass,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Layton, UT ",Beautfiul Views,"This is a beautiful drive to get to Teton Village. It is a steep road but well maintained. Be aware it can get slippery quickly if it starts to snow and it can be closed when there is snow. However, it is worth the trip for the view and a nice alternative to head south from Teton Village through the mountains."
92,Teton_Pass,Jun 2015,not available,"Marion, VA ",Teton Pass,Beautiful views on our way to Teton Village and Jackson Hole WY. We stayed in area for 3 nights and left on a Sunday morning. The pass was cloaked in fog until we reached the summit---beautiful!!!
93,Teton_Pass,Aug 2015 , Friends,"Houston, TX ",GORGEOUS!,"Beautiful, beautiful! I went there during summer. Such gorgeous views everywhere! Hoping to go back next year."
94,Teton_Pass,Aug 2015 , Family,"Pensacola, FL ",Nice views of Jackson Hole,"We stayed in Driggs, ID but spent most of our time on the Jackson Hole side of the Tetons which meant a daily trip across Teton Pass. Definitely not for the faint of heart or those uncomfortable with steep, winding roads. Otherwise, enjoy the view and watch out for elk, deer, moose, etc."
95,Teton_Pass,Aug 2015 , Family,Alameda ,Is amazing - when Idaho isn't on fire,"I have been here several times, and the views are amazing...but this last time, the sky was so hazy that you couldn't see much. This last experience made me realize that there is not much to hold your interest on the trails if you don't have access to the views. So I would recommend not going on days very overcast or hazy."
96,Teton_Pass,Sep 2015 , Business,Virginia ,Majestically beautiful,"Viewing the Tetons was breath taking. They are majestic beautiful mountains in a beautiful setting. We also saw buffalo, moose, deer, elk and bear. We loved every minute of our visit."
97,Teton_Pass,Sep 2015 , Couples, ,Gorgeous drive through the mountains.,Gorgeous drive from Wyoming to Idaho through Teton Pass. The road is wide and easy driving compared to some mountain passes. You just never run out of beautiful views.
98,Teton_Pass,Jul 2015 , Couples,"Leesburg, VA ",Stop Here If Driving Over The Mountains,"What does the top of a pass offer but views? Nothing, but what else does it need. This pass offers a stunning view toward Jackson WY. The view into Idaho is underwhelming, but it doesn't matter, take a minute and drink in that view."
99,Teton_Pass,Aug 2015 , Friends, ,Spectacular view,What a wonderful view of Teton Village and the valley. We went up on the gondola and enjoyed perfect summertime views.
100,Teton_Pass,Jul 2015 , Friends,"Long Beach, NY ",The first stop on a great day.,We crossed through the Teton Pass on our way from Teton Village to circle through Idaho and back into Wyoming along the Snake River. It's a beautiful excursion and was perhaps even more enjoyable than the parks. A must for anyone visiting the area.
101,Teton_Pass,Mar 2015 , Couples,"Chattanooga, TN ",Lucky to get 1 last snow fall at the end of the season!,"End of season and a rare snow storm! We lucked out coming end of season when the rates are lower, but to get quite a bit of snow was a real treat. Even the locals were out to ski!"
102,Teton_Pass,Jul 2015 , Family,"Panama City Beach, FL ",Fabulous view!,WE took the Tram to the top and saw a breathtaking view! We enjoyed a boat tour around Jenny Lake then took the boat across to hike up to Hidden Falls. A short hike and our four year old grand child walked up and back the whole way!!
103,Teton_Pass,Aug 2014 , Family,"Jasper, TX ",Beautiful,You have to see it to believe it. If you have ever been to the rockies this is even more beautiful than they are.
104,Teton_Pass,Feb 2015 , Couples,"Crossett, ",You know God kissed the world here,What a beautiful drive into Idaho across the pass. They keep the road clear most of the time...might watch for closings if there is fresh snowfall. The views are just breathtaking. Mountains and valleys on the same road make for spectacular photo ops. A must drive for any visitor to the area. Simply chilling!
105,Teton_Pass,Jul 2015 , Couples, ,"Wow, just wow!","We recently stayed in Teton village and wanted to make the trip to Idaho so we took this road. All I can say is the view is overwhelming. If you are prone to carsickness you might want to be prepared and if you are the driver you need to stay focused, but be ready for a beautiful ride!"
106,Teton_Pass,Jun 2015 , Couples,"Monument, CO, ",Winding roads in between beautiful mountains,"If you are the driver, keep your eyes on the road. Otherwise, enjoy the beauty of the mountains as you traverse this pass through the Tetons"
107,Teton_Pass,May 2015 , Couples,"Beaumont, TX ",Beautiful,"Nothing to dislike about this beautiful place. It is hard to keep your eyes on the road, because you just want to absorb all the beauty. Probably why the speed limit is 45 on the highway. The back roads take a while, but worth the very slow speed to watch for the wildlife."
108,Teton_Pass,Mar 2015 , Solo,Columbia ,Teton Pass Powder,"An awesome day of powder skiing off the southside of the Teton Pass with my guide Matt from Yostmark Backcountry Tours. We had deep untracked powder on the day after a 12-14 inch dump on the high pass. I obtained all my touring equipment from Yostmark in Driggs Idaho. Matt was an excellent guide. He is super organized, in tune with his client's goals and most of all he is safety conscience. This was my third trip into the backcountry and second guided trip with Matt. There seemed to be endless options for skiing moderately steep slopes with deep powder. Teton pass is a great location. If you ever thought of trying backcountry skiing, go for it! I am hooked."
