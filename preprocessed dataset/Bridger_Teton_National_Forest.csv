23,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Port Orchard, WA ",Scenic Drive,"The drive from Grand Teton National Park to Cody Wyoming is a long one, about 3 hours or so. As beautiful as Grand Teton is with its iconic mountain range on the western border, the closer we got to Cody, the more interesting the highway became. Beautiful mountains, wonderful rock formations, beautiful creeks and rivers running adjacent to the road, and a few meandering bison. Many nice spots to pull over and take photos! It is really one of the prettiest areas we've driven through since we visited Sedona Arizona. Try it, you'll like it!"
24,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2018 , Couples, ,The Grand Tetons!,"This is a must see! It's absolutely beautiful, and no other mountain range is like it. To stand and look at what is in front of you is to know what magnificent really means!"
25,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,May 2019 , Friends,"Wallington, UK ",Spectacular,"I loved it here. Despite a little low cloud and unexpected snow, the mountains looked spectacular. We saw wildlife - some very close to - and had a great walk around Jenny Lake. The snow made part of the trail a little slippery in places but it's an easy walk. The lake was beautiful. There is a boat which takes you to the visitor centre if you wish and it's $10 one way. Walking is much better and the air feels so clean and fresh."
26,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,May 2019 , Couples,"McDonough, GA ",Majestic peaks rivaling the best of Switzerland,"Leaving Jackson, Wyoming (yes, it was once called Jackson Hole) and heading north toward Yellowstone Park, you'll come first to the picturesque Grand Teton National Park. Snowcaped all year long, this is your greatest opportunity to see firsthand the awesome natural beauty of one of God's greatest creations. In mid May there was much snow covering the ground and some public facilities had yet to be opened. Be sure to visit Jenny Lake and it's pebbles beach but forget taking a swim at this time of year. The lake still had a thick coating of ice and snowmobile tracks could be seen across its entirety. The store/gift shop (obviously) was open and we bought souvenirs for the grandkids. In years past, I've seen plenty of wildlife throughout the park but few were sighted on this day of exploring. No real problem because ample elk, mule deer, buffalo and other types of wildlife will be encountered up the road toward Yellowstone. While there be sure to inhale a lung full of the clean air found in abundance at this altitude."

32,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2018,not available,"Sheridan, WY ",Better than GTNP,Camped at Granite Creek campground. Very nice campground along beautiful wild and scenic designated granite creek. There was only two other campers in the entire campground.

Compared with the crowds at GTNP campgrounds this place was tops!!!
33,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2018 , Couples,Toledo ,Pictures don't begin to cover the beauty of the Tetons,"Absolutely beautiful and should not be missed on any trip through WY.

Too much waste!"

37,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Oct 2018,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",Third largest national forest outside Alaska,"Over 2,000 miles of hiking trails are located in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, providing access into wilderness areas and interlinking with trails in Yellowstone National Park. Established in 1908 and located in western Wyoming, the forest covers 3.4 million acres, making it the third largest National Forest outside Alaska. It stretches from Yellowstone National Park along the eastern boundary of Grand Teton National Park and from there rides along the western slope of the Continental Divide to the southern end of the Wind River Range. Located within the forest are the Gros Ventre, Bridger and Teton Wildernesses, totaling 1.2 million acres. Other points of interest within the forest include Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming at 13,804 feet, and the Gros Ventre landslide, which is one of the largest readily visible landslides on earth. Aside from Gannett Peak, there are 40 other mountains that rise above 12,000 feet. The abundant snowfall, exceeding 600 inches at some locations, provides a constant supply of water for streams and rivers. In addition, 1,500 lakes provide water for the Yellowstone, Snake and Green rivers, which all have their headwaters in the forest. Access to the forest and its several dozen vehicle accessible campgrounds is by US Route 26 and US Route 287 over the Continental Divide at Togwotee Pass from the north and US Highways 89 and 191 near Jackson, Wyoming, from the south. Seventy-five species of mammals are known to exist in the forest, including elk, moose, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, coyote, marmot, pronghorn and cougar. Be aware of the weather. Nighttime temperatures can dip below freezing any time of the year."

42,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Atlanta, GA ",America the Beautiful,"America is a beautiful country with many awe inspiring places. The Tetons make you realize once again how beautiful our country is. Almost every corner of this park is a photo opportunity. The kind of place you just want to sit down and soak it in. From boating, ferry riding, photo stopping, hiking, and camping, this place has something for everyone. The park was well mapped which was appreciated. Highly recommend."

48,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2018 , Couples,Wapakoneta ,beautiful,Enjoyed it much more than Yellowstone. It had some smoke cloud cover but was still beautiful. Be sure to take the drive to the summit. The road is narrow but two cars can pass each other in opposite directions. The view from top is amazing. The park needs more parking at sites so plan on not finding some parking in some of the locations you want to look at.
49,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Huntersville, NC ",Yellowstone Vacation,"Grand Teton mountains were breathtaking to see, both from a long distance and up close! Enjoyed walking lake trails and watching elk in the area. Beautiful area of the park, would highly recommend."

52,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Birmingham, AL ",Your heart will Soar,"The Great Teton mountain range will make your heart soar when you see their immense beauty and majesty. It is wonderful to see these mountains rise above the Snake River and the flat land in the valley below. This is very picturesque with the very high mountains with snow usually still showing on top of the mountains no matter what time of year. This is just outside of Jackson Hole, Wyoming and part of the Great Tetons National Park. It can be viewed from Jackson Hole area without going into the National Park if you are just visiting Jackson Hole."

We turned it on and the voice tour guide followed our route and explained the history of the Tetons and YS. Explained where and why to stop and take a look, and a walk, in certain areas. It's a great companion to make the trip easy."
57,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2018 , Friends,"Lincolnville, ME ",Majestic,"I had the opportunity to drive through Teton National park twice in 3 days and I would go again. Each view was better than the previous one. With lots of pull offs there is no need to stop in the middle of the road to capture the view. The descriptions were worth reading at various points of view. If you like to bike, I would suggest bringing a bicycle (not sure, but I thought I saw rentals), park and get on the bike path. As in all moutainous areas the weather can change quickly. Bring layers, a back if you hike, and as noted in Yellowstone last week, hike with a group and bring your bear spray!"
58,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2018 , Couples, ,Vistas that amaze you,The forest has a very nice bicycle path and some other interesting trails. Loved the “ how to not encounter a bear” presentation at the Rockefeller center. Very nice day.

65,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2018,not available,"Odenville, AL ",Absolutely Beautiful,"The Grand Tetons are absolutely beautiful. The park is small compared to Yosemite, but you still need at least a full day to see all of the highlights. When they tell you to beware that wildlife could be on the roadways, take note! We had a close encounter with two elk but thankfully we were traveling at the reduced night time speed of 45 mph. Very close to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, as well as Yellowstone National Park. We stayed five days and want to return to the area (we visited in the summer, so would love to visit during snow)."
66,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2018 , Family,"Waukesha, WI ",Grand Teton National Park,"If you are in the area, definitely worth taking a drive through the park.

75,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2018 , Friends, ,Stunning views,Absolutely phenomenal!! It was all I hoped it would be.

96,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jun 2018 , Family,"Kemp, TX ",Breath Taking,"The Grand Teton's are beautiful and a must see if you are in the area. Be aware that you can get into the park from Yellowstone, but if you leave and come back in, you will have to pay a separate fee. I would love to come back in the winter and see this place covered in snow."
97,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jun 2018 , Couples,San Francisco ,A classic and beautiful piece of nature that belongs to us all,"If you're in this part of the country and are going to Yellowstone Park, which you should, you really should include this park and mountain range in your tour. There are no bad views in the range. Many great hikes and lakes and trails."
98,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jun 2018 , Friends,"Rice Lake, WI ",Beautiful drive with wildlife,"We spent a day by coming up through Jackson Hole. Not as many mountains as Yellowstone, but a different beauty. The visitor's center gave us some good insight on where to find wildlife. Saw moose by the Gros Ventre river, elk in several places, and various deer along the entire drive. Nice hiking and less busy than Yellowstone so it was very relaxing. Go early in the day if you want to see wildlife and have plenty of time for activities."
99,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jun 2018 , Couples, ,Teton National Forest,"Not as famous as Yellowstone to the north, but it has excellent hiking trails, sights, scenic boat tours at the three lodges in the park.  Be sure to check out Jackson Hole for a gondola trip to the top of the Tetons."
100,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jul 2018 , Family,"Baltimore, MD ",Absolutely Amazing!!,"My family and I visited Teton National park for three wonderful days. The mountains still have snow in late June. They are so beautiful!! We saw A female Grizzly Bear and two cubs. She had a collar and we were told she is numbered 399 and has her own Facebook page. We saw three moose, lots of elk, mule deer, and a coyote. We took a hike on Jenny Lake to Hidden Falls which was amazing. If you don’t want to hike the 2.3 miles each way they offer a boat ride which is only .5 miles from the falls. I recommend going to Teton Village and taking the tram to the top of Mt. Rendezvous which is 10,000 plus feet in elevation. While at the top we made snowballs, took in the view once the clouds cleared ,then ate waffles and drank hot chocolate at Corbett’s cabin at the summit. We stayed in a two bedroom cabin at Colter Village which was great. We took a dinner rafting trip down the Snake River and a boat breakfast cruise out of the Colter Bay village marina to Elk island which is on Jackson Lake.This park is a must see!! I loved every minute of it."

102,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jun 2018 , Family,Minnesota ,Beautiful,"Breathe taking views, the main areas stopping are very crowded, so we avoided those areas. We saw a moose with her twin babies! Mormon row is very neat, stay on that road and take a right toward Jackson, stop by the river at the pull off to see moose.

I have dreamed of seeing them my entire life after hearing about them from my grandparent’s many visits out west. They would show me their pictures and I would dream of seeing them in person one day. I am so thankful that I was able to see them with my own eyes...and when I did, I cried because they are so breathtaking. Pictures do not do them justice. God had His creations are amazing!!!!"
124,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Oct 2017 , Family,"Little Meadows, PA ",Absolutely beautiful...,"We traveled through here on our Family cross country trip from Pennsylvania to Montana and the Teton National Forest will leave you in awe of the natural beauty this country truly has.  Throughout our visit here you witness all ranges of animals including elk, moose, bison, black bear and even grizzlies. The grizzly was most impressive just due to the absolute sheer size that they are. At one point, we stopped on the road to witness an elk that was taken down, in which wolves found an interest in. I’ve never seen so many spotting scopes go up.  Every photo taken from this area looked like a postcard with the mountain ranges just covered in snow caps. It truly was a majestic site to behold.  All in all, a stunning part of the country to visit at least once in your lifetime. If ever you have the chance…go, you won’t be disappointed."

I have traveled extensively and have seen many beautiful places before but this place is absolutely glorious!!! I can't remember ever seeing a more beautiful landscape with so many outdoor activities, or animals. If you're on a budget camp, bring your own food, and drink instant coffee if you have to (we did), just get here. There are so many trails for biking, hiking or walking on that you could stay here for weeks and not hit every trail. This place is amazing. Bring pepper spray and a camera because there is so much wildlife, including bears, you're not going to want to miss that perfect picture. There are campgrounds in abundance so no need to worry about a place to sleep, we slept in the van at a campground off the beaten path. I think it's $30 entrance fee for the park unless you're 100%disabled then you get a free national park pass if you bring proof of your disability."

We drove through the Tetons from our visit to Yellowstone. Looking back I wish we would have stayed longer. The time of the day we were there was very busy and crowded and the sites tha we stopped at were filled with cars and many other tourists circling around hoping to find a place to park. Really a place that should be explored!"
133,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Oct 2017 , Couples, ,Honeymoon Heaven,"We spent one week in the Grand Tetons. There is an incredible amount of things to do in the area from Jackson in the south and into the Teton National Park.    The views are amazing, hiking trails are fantastic and wildlife is abundant.    We stayed at and HIGHLY recommend Budge's Slide Lake Cabins. The Cabins are modern log cabin style, full of every amenity you could need and quaint, quiet and the scenery is absolutely beautiful in this private little Valley with a small lake and river literally 50' from the cabin."

I would love to bring my dad someday, as this is one area of WY that he has not visited. We were fortunate to come off season, so no crowds. Many opportunities to pull over to take photos and just gaze at the gorgeous scenery. The fact that we had purchased a lifetime Sr. Pass made it all the better!"
139,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2017 , Couples,Bishops Stortford UK ,Fabulous on a clear day,"This park was on my bucket list, and on the day of our principal visit it did not disappoint. The weather was clear and sunny so the views of the mountain range - which is what this place is about - were glorious.  We got off to a great start with a coyote sighting next to the road and then a 10 minute fairly close viewing of a female moose with calf.  The rest of the day was just visiting viewing places plus a trip across the lake (a bit pricey) to visit the Hidden Falls. This last was great. There is a good track through the trees to the falls, but you should be warned that much of the mile walk is uphill.  There are a number of spots on the way up where you think that what you can see are the Hidden Falls, but keep going because the final view is spectacular (and you will know that you have reached the end)."

All attractions were so full of tourists, we didn't bother to stop because there were no places to park.  Beautiful drive and scenery, just to dang many people. Did not expect so many tourists this time of year. We have visited before so we scratched the park tour, but if you want to enjoy the peace of nature, this was not the time to visit. Absolutely NO parking available at Jenny Lake north and south or at String lake. Cars backed up and parking by main road that turns into parking area."

Stopped by the northern visitor center and got a map and dirrections to areas where wildlife could be seen. Drove all over the place, saw a few elk nothing else. Finally exited the park on our way to Jackson Hole and went by the park gate. People entering from Jackson Hole were stopping and having to pay!"
149,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2017 , Couples,"Minneapolis, MN ",So sad the fires/smoke clouded our view!,"We entered Yellowstone from the East side and drove South to Jackson Hole for the night. Dry lightning had started fires around Sheridan and we even noticed Mount Rushmore was hazy when we stopped. The further West we drove, the worse it got. The Grand Tetons were not so grand during our stay, because we could barely see them! :(( We took the 'inside'/lake drive going down. Very pretty drive. Hope to visit Tetons again at some point when there is no hazy forest fire smoke to block the grand views of these majestic mountains."

We saw a lot of buffalo and bird's. You can also hike, but I have limitations, so we stuck to the auto route. I'm sure there is more to see if you hike in the park. Great route to Yellowstone. We were there Memorial Day weekend, early in the morning and the only traffic problem we had was some buffalo in the road, but we wanted to take pictures of them, so we were happy!"

If we hadn't been using the REI app it would have been even more challenging.

185,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jul 2017,not available,"Apple Valley, MN ",Just beautiful!,"This range of mountains is magnificent. We found that getting to it is a bit time-consuming, since you either enter through Yellowstone, or though Jackson, and either way can take up to an hour (maybe there is another way in that we were not aware of) But entering the Grand Teton National Park from Yellowstone is amazing!  We camped one night at Colter Bay and we had a really great campsite (these are first come, first served, and we found the campground to be filled by 1:00 or so for tent camping). We did see some sites that were not very nice (along the path to the bathroom, too near other campers)  There are several lakes in the park and some fun trails to hike."

Wherever you turn the sky is blue and the formations of the clouds over the mountain change to form puffy cotton balls to dark clouds of the knowing brief thunderstorms about to unload.  The snake river can be ominous for rafting, relaxing and tranquil depending  on the location chosen. Or pitch a canopy along one of the entrance areas  on the river go paddle board, canoeing, fishing or swim close to the shore line. Whatever you decide to do will be wonderful being in this heavenly spot."

Be prepared to go early due to parking areas full and cars parked along side of the roads.    There are a number of turn outs to stop and take photos or even to get out and ride a bike or hike. Also, there are a number of trails to hit too with decent amount of parking.    Do not be disappointed should it be foggy, hazy, or raining. The mountains are still beautiful to see.

We loved our time spent riding down every backroad and seeing so many grand sites along the way. We bought the tickets going in to Yellowstone also ,so we paid $50 for both for a 7 day pass to enter and leave. There's no postcard to really catch the breathtaking beauty of the Tetons."

199,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jul 2017 , Couples, ,Absolutely Amazing,"It is very hard to describe the beauty of these mountains. I'd recommend staying in Jackson the night before and then from sunrise head up to Teton. I believe the park is often overlooked because of the massive caliber of Yellowstone just to the north, but DO NOT MISS THESE! An absolutely must see, even if just driving through. If you like art/oil paintings, an artist by the name of Jim Wilcox has spent much of his time here and in other areas where he has ""Canvased the West."" I believe he puts on an art clinic every year in Jackson."

It was a bit tricky as we hit some hair,snow and rain mix once we arrived at the park entrance but managed just fine going slowly. We were pulling a 37 ft. Camper. Coming down as we neared Jackson, Wy isn't too bad but the overlooks can be scary if you're afraid of high walls. The road is plenty wide enough just look straight ahead and you'll be fine. I may have been less nervous if it wasn't so cold with rainy conditions.. 36°and high winds. Still glad we made the trek and we'll worth seeing."

The Grand Tetons NP were an hour away and Yellowstone NP was 2 hours away. You would go through the Teton National Forest to get to both national parks. The views were breathtaking. 8,000 feet was where the snow line started. In May the snow was at least 6 feet high at the side of the road."

Majestic and powerful reminding me how insignificant we are to the earth's creation. It is a awesome journey on the way to Jackson Hole. Wyoming. Broad and open landscapes and lakes and rivers between you and the mountains and great biking trails. There is one historical site. A ranch cabin and a history of the family ranch. Imagine waking up and seeing those mountains everyday. A hard life but a blessed one.

Snow capped heights, meadows and green mysterious pathways. Such majesty it just takes your breath away. At times you just stand in silence and awe and take time to wonder how others, the first people, the first settlers, saw these things. Was it fear or wonder? It will make you think. The park had suffered fire damage so it was interesting to see how the fire had moved throughout and in some places was still smoldering. I recommend every one visit at least once in their lives, there are none like these, their majesty will never leave you."

You have to image many years ago how the Earth was being formed many years ago to give us the spectacular views today. More importantly you have to appreciate them. Then you have to throw in the streams and lakes that are available to fish in. Truly a beautiful area to visit. Teton Village was also nice to visit and roam around. Not a lot to do. You could ride the Tram to the top but we elected not to do that. Spent more time in Jackson Hole. Stayed at the Wyoming Inn..a very nice hotel.

Did not see any wildlife kinda of rainy that day but seriously we were traveling at sunset. Never saw a sunset the was truly amazing. The mountains were in the distance and the sun was behind them. Where the mountain valleys were the sun shone through the mountains like a beacon got some wonderful photos. Stayed in jackson,wy for the night at the virginian rv park.

However, we were so amazed by the gorgeous sights of the massive mountain range and wildlife. The school kids were all back at school so we really enjoyed the slower, quieter time here. Jackson was a cute town with great food. I loved the Mormon Row barns and homesteads. Fascinating. I wished we were able to stay longer to have seen sunset on the Tetons but we're unable to. I will have to come back again to spend at least several days here. Two days was simply not enough time here."

258,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2016 , Solo,"Columbia, MD ","Yep, what I came for...","There are the iconic great views, of course, The mountains look forbidding, but what is surprising is you can get in there and hike around, I did the Cascade Canyon hike and was up in there between two of the tetons. Not bragging, just kind of a nice, intermediate, ascending hike where you can look up at the rocky slopes on both sides of you. Other days, hiked around Taggart and Phelps at the Laurance Rockefeller center (reviewed elsewhere). There is a diorama at the latter that suggests a 15 mile round trip to one of the peaks! (Granted, be in shape, start before dawn...)    Very enjoyable, beautiful weather, fresh air and make you sleep well exercise. I do have one consternation though, Nothing's cheap around here from Jackson to the sold out lodges in Yellowstone, Not a problem for me, but a national park for well off people. Maybe Yellowstone and Grand Teton are the golden eggs for the rest of underfunded park system..."

We came into the park at Moran, so got early vistas - the best. Stay in Jackson where there are great hotels, restaurants, shops etc. Jackson lake lodge is overpriced and overvalued. The customer comes last. Don't miss the Tetons!"

262,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Cincinnati, OH ",A must see,"The Mountains and Lakes in Grand Teton are amazing. Everything is so clean. Great area to hike, especially around Jenny Lake and to Phelps lake."

264,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2016 , Couples,SAC CITY ,Teton National Park,We definitely enjoyed the majestic views of the mountains. We came out of Yellowstone to the Grand Tetons and were awed by the views.
265,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Oct 2015,not available,"Calistoga, CA ",Breathtaking beauty,"We decided to go on an adventure and drove here from our home in Iowa. We usually prefer to fly so we don't ""waste"" too much travel time in the car on vacation. But seeing beautiful America from the car window, stopping whenever we felt like it to absorb the sights and enjoying each other's company (with two teenagers!) turned out to be one of our best vacations ever. We stayed in the Grand Tetons for 4 days before heading over to Yellowstone. I highly recommend it!"
266,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Torrance, CA ",Beautiful Backpacking,"I backpacked here overnight with my husband. I'm going to be honest. I'm basically an out of shape 40 year old woman, but was able to handle the hike decently (near Jenny lake) and the views were breathtaking. We didn't see any large wildlife but enjoyed the Pikas. In June the weather was just cool enough to make walking pleasant and sporatic rain helped. The Tetons should be on everyone's bucket list!"
267,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Topeka, KS ",Beautiful,We didn't have much time but what we saw was gorgeous and the main roads which we stayed on were very good and they have many places to pull off the main road to take pixs

269,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2016 , Couples,"Norfolk, NE ",Great views! Spectacular photo opportunities.,If I wasn't so afraid of bears I would have hiked all over this place. One spectacular view after another's! The Grand Teton is a fabulous Mt. as is Mt. Moran. Colter Bay is also a beautiful spot!
270,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2016 , Friends, ,Amazing,"I cannot begin to describe how amazingly beautiful the Teton National Forest is. I visited over Labor Day 2016, and I cannot wait to go back. We were driving through on our way to Yellowstone and decided to come back through on our way back to SLC. I pick this over Yellowstone any day."
271,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2016 , Couples, ,Breathtaking.,Magnificent scenery from beginning to end. Tetons were the most unusual mountain range I have ever seen. Take the 1 hour cruise on the Lake. The guides are enjoyable and informative.
272,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2016 , Couples,Kentucky ,"Great Drive, Beautiful Scenery","After driving down Mormon Row in the Antelope Flats area we turned left toward Kelly, then continued on and turned right on the Gros Ventre Road. This took us back to the Bridger-Teton National Forest. We drove to the Slide Lake which is where the paved road ended. People were fly fishing (and catching). Rose hips are growing along the edge of the lake...it is really beautiful. We spoke with a gentleman who appeared to be the caretaker and he suggested we continue our drive a couple more miles on the gravel road for a good view of the Tetons down the valley. So glad we did. Views were spectacular. There were several ranches on this road. It is just a beautiful drive. So glad we decided to explore!"
273,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2016 , Couples, ,beautiful tourist place.,"the view was beautiful, had only few areas to get pictures at., very expensive to eat at. kind of a let down."

275,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2016 , Family,"Fairport, NY ",Stunning,"We hiked trails at Jackson Lake Lodge and rafted along the snake river enjoying the views. You couldn't get enough of the view or breathe in enough of the fresh air. After our raft trip, we saw 2 grizzly cubs with mama bear, a highlight and first time experience for me. After a couple days, wildfires created a haze where you could see just a outline of the Tetons...mesmerizing."
276,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Sep 2016 , Family,Belmont ,BEAUTIFUL,don't miss out on the Tetons when you visit Yellowstone- equally worth a day or more if you have the time

280,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Saint Louis, MO ",Simply Incredible.,"Teton National Park is a must see for everyone. The park is by far the most beautiful place we have been.

From fly fishing in the snake river to simply hiking on the trails you can't help but stare at the beauty of the mountains.

283,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Blue Ridge, GA ",Absolutely Beautiful,"The Tetons are in my opinion, the most beautiful range of mountains in the continental United States. We've seen them all and nothing compares. Their rocky spires and glaciated peaks are outer worldly."
284,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Aug 2016 , Couples,"Brookville, OH ",The newest mountain range is spectacular...,"For rugged beauty the Grand Tetons are amazing. We took advantage of a tram ride to over 10,000 ft in Teton Village to overlook the Jackson Valley and a ten mile float trip down the Snake River. Make sure the trip takes you ten miles upstream to get the best view of the mountains. Eagles and osprey were often seen on this very pleasant 2 hour trip with a knowledgeable guide. Very calm and peaceful... We had small children with us... no problem."
285,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Bergen, Norway ",Stunning views,Everybody should get the opportunity to visit this gem of a park! It has everything to offer!

We hiked half way around Jenny Lake and took a boat back - fantastic!! Start early in the morning to catch the sunrise and avoid the crowds.

293,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jun 2016 , Family,"Shawnee, KS ",Most Amazing Views,We had previously spend the week up in Yellowstone and then spent our last few days here. The views were amazing. We saw as many bison here as in Yellowstone and more prong horn and a moose. In the summer months you will not see elk as they all migrate north. There were lots of outdoors activities like horseback riding and whitewater rafting. The area has a very different feel from Yellowstone. The area seems much more populated and touristy. Make sure to get your picture taken by the elk arches.
294,Bridger_Teton_National_Forest,Jul 2016 , Couples,"Melrose, MA ",Magnificent views,We added the Grand Tetons to our trip to Yellowstone National Park and we are so thankful we did.
