1,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Feb 2022 , Couples,"Ooltewah, TN ",A Must,"This is a great way to spend a couple of hours if you are in Jackson Hole. See the videos first, then do the galleries. Unbelievable art whether you are into it or not. We've been driving by this place for years and finally decided to visit. Worth the price of admission which is very reasonable."
2,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Feb 2022 , Couples,"Kiawah Island, SC ",Worthwhile visit,Interesting museum in a beautiful location. Viewed the nationalgeographic exhibit which was interesting. Would like to return in warmer weather.
3,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Feb 2022 , Solo,"Coldwater, MI ",Time we’ll spent,A well told story about wildlife art In a beautiful setting on a bluff overlooking the elk preserve. Exciting bronze sculptures outdoors build anticipation for the fine collection inside. A very classy place.
4,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2021,not available,"Granby, CT ",Worth a Visit,"If you are in Jackson and have a few hours to explore this museum, it is definitely worth your time. There were some special exhibits that we really enjoyed. We also enjoyed lunch at the cafe there which was very good."
5,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Oct 2021,not available, ,A somewhat hidden gem -- we loved it,"It is hard to get any real sense of the museum as you pass by on the road because it is built into the hillside. But this turned out to be a favorite part of our trip and it is a fantastic excursion to save for a bad weather day. Overall this is a terrific museum that is much larger inside that it appears from the outside -- it has a soaring entry hall, large, beautiful exhibits, a good sized theater which showed several extremely interesting documentary films. They have a great range of historic wildlife art and well-done and interesting descriptions and commentary. There is a fabulous (if a little small) children's section. They also have a great sculpture garden outside. Finally, while we wouldn't visit the museum just for this they also have a very nice and pretty good sized gift shop with items you won't find in downtown Jackson. (Oh, and it may sound strange to say but they have the most artistic bathrooms we've ever seen. If you go you'll understand what we mean. Quite beautiful.)"
6,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Jan 2022,not available,Arizona ,Worth The Stop,Beautiful artwork throughout in a beautiful facility. Well worth the stop - you can get through this in about 60-90 minutes.
7,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Dec 2021 , Solo, ,Great collection and beautiful building,"An amazing collection of art. The staff was helpful, it was easy to social distance, they had free lockers for storing bags and coats (which they don’t allow in the galleries to protect the art). It was a $15 Uber ride from downtown. I would recommend!"
8,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Dec 2021,not available,"Clearwater, FL ",A Must Visit while in Jackson,This is a must see while in Yellowstone and Jackson WY area. It is a beautiful building inside and out with incredible wildlife art galleries. Restaurant Palate is excellent as well. With lunch allow 3 hours for your visit  .
9,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Nov 2021 , Friends,"Eastham, MA ",Outstanding exhibits,"This museum is a gem. The experience starts with the exterior—interesting stone architecture and outdoor sculpture gardens. The exhibitions are diverse—paintings, sculptures, mixed media—focused on wildlife regionally and around the world. The timelines showing the status of species relative to the human dimension, major impacts, as well as wildlife protection laws, was compelling. Activities for children are available as well, making this spot nice for a family experience."
10,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2021,not available,"Argyle, TX, ",Amazing Sculptures,"Our dogs were traveling with us, so we were limited to viewing only the outside sculptures. The artistry is amazing and is a wonderful tribute to the native animals. One of our dogs started barking and backing away from the wolf sculpture - that's how realistic it was!"
11,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,May 2021,not available,"North Carolina Mountains, NC, ",Great art!,"Amazing artwork of all kinds; some from famous artists, some not so famous. The outdoor displays are great and we really enjoyed our time there.  Highly recommend stopping there!"

13,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Oct 2021,not available, ,Fabulous! Just Fabulous!,"An amazing collection of exquisite art from world famous to lesser known artists. The collection combines art, appreciation of wildlife, and the landscape of this amazing area. I have visited museums around the world and I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It was far more than I was expecting. What a treat! Don't miss it!"
14,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2021,not available,"Marion, NC ",Interesting,We went to this museum on our own and we were won over by all the amazing artwork. Being able to see an original Thomas Moran and just take in the beauty of the sculptures and paintings was well worth the short drive from Jackson. You won't be disappointed making this a stop on your trip.
15,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Tampa, FL ",Truly Wonderful,"A building designed to fit its surroundings. The stone structure itself is 2 stories built into the side of the hill it’s on. Parking is easy and free. Upon entering we were on the second level in a large, light and airy atrium and you can use an elevator or lovely curved staircase to go to the first level. We anticipated staying about 90 min but were there more than 2 1/2 hrs.    An interesting aspect was the notes on all the pieces. Graphic symbols were used to highlight whether the piece was of cultural, historical, artistic (or some combination) significance. Notes were easy to read and understand but we found so many of the works beautiful without knowing more. The range or artists was even larger than we anticipated and the art included sculpture as well as various styles and types of work.    A special exhibit of endangered wildlife by Andy Warhol was displayed. It’s his inimitable style but we were surprised he’d done such a collection and were intrigued by the story behind it. Another special exhibit of lego portraits by an Asian artist was hanging opposite it. In addition, there was a wide variety of pieces done by local artists and those attending the museum were encouraged to submit a vote for the one they liked best. Surprisingly, in spite of the large number of submissions, my husband and I decided on the same one.    We had already eaten an early lunch but the cafe looked inviting. The gift shop had quite a selection of reproductions as well.    Strongly encourage checking out this truly wonderful place!"

18,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2021,not available,"Tampa, FL, ",Must See if you are a Art Enthusiast | Don't Miss Out on This Gem of a Museum!,"I was a bit skeptical about going to a museum dedicated to wildlife art but I was quickly proved wrong and pleasantly surprised at how rewarding and entertaining the artworks and sculptures were. The admission price for adults was just under $15.00 and it was worth every cent. What a fabulous experience.    many local artists are highlighted and plenty of wildlife portraits, many inspiring.    I really recommend a visit."
19,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2021 , Couples,"Matthews, North Carolina, USA ",Great time at the museum!,We loved this museum and spent about 3 hours there. The available (and free) audio guide that you access via a phone app is excellent as are the exhibits. We went here first on our arrival in Jackson and it was a great way to kick off our visit.

Great collection of older and new art of all types. of animals..the lego ""paintings"" you see as you leave the galleries are really amazing.

23,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2021 , Couples, ,Tells the story of humans and animals and our complicated relationships through art. Definitely recommend for wildlife lovers.,"My husband and I both loved this museum. The focus is on the relationship between humans and wild animals, going as far back as pre-Columbian pottery. There was an interesting section on European art and its emphasis on ""menagerie"" depictions with themes of domination and control, followed by the shift to realism after Darwin's theories became widespread. Beautiful art for its own sake as well as for telling the story between animals and humans. Nice gift shop as well :) Very friendly staff."
24,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Aug 2021,not available, ,Wildlife Art Museun,"Wonderful museum with many different art forms, all focused on wildlife, mainly western US animals. Worthwhile place to visit."

It is not a large museum but very well curated and manageable. It will have something that should interest everyone and the people who work there are very nice and helpful. The building itself is a work art nestled into the base on the mountains. The sculptures, in order and out, are beautiful dynamic pieces. The inside covers a wide variety and the Warhol exhibit was really cool. Definitely worth stopping in."

27,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Aug 2021,not available,"Cleveland, OH ",Definitely worth a visit!!,"We stopped on a rainy day and so pleased we did not miss this Jackson Hole gem. Beautiful collections of local and national wildlife from the the late 1800's onward. We were lucky to catch the Andy Warhol special exhibit -- not something I would expect in a museum like this but were beautiful! Masks required, lots of room to explore, beautiful architecture inside and out."
28,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Aug 2021,not available,"Hackettstown, NJ ",Wonderful place to visit both outside and inside,If you are into museums (and even if you're not) the National Museum of Wildlife Art will not disappoint. I recommend going before the heat of the day sets in so you can comfortably walk the paths around the museum to enjoy all of the outdoor sculptures before going inside. The collection of art indoors was top notch. At the time we went there was an Andy Warhol endangered species exhibit which was very impressive. We spent about three hours total outside and inside. They have a lovely cafe on site as well.
29,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Aug 2021,not available,California ,"Interesting Museum Outside of Jackson, WY","Really excellent museum with a great cafe. Extensive art work inside and huge sculptures of animals outisde. They are currently showcasing wild animal artwork done by Andy Warhol, who was apparently a wildlife advocate. And it's juxtaposed against artwork done by a Chinese artist who developed animal portaits using Legos. And, the rest of the artwork, combined with background information on the development of the West was really interesting."
30,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Jul 2021,not available,"St. George, UT ",This One Is On Dan!,"Must admit it – I resisted the idea. Wife wanted to badly, but I held back. For three days!    Then I spoke by phone with a dear friend in FL. He recounted his last trip to Jackson Hole, WY and how he wished he was there with us now.    One of his all-time favs was just outside of town on the way to Grand Teton National Park. As he spoke, his infectious enthusiasm started to have an impact on me.    That is how I found a new personal fav – The National Museum of Wildlife Art on the fringe of Jackson, WY,    The displays of the museum are both outside and inside the building. Many are large, really large sculptures that are just awesome. Others are minute. All are of the finest quality I have ever viewed.    To be honest we did not spend the four hours enjoying the exhibits that Dan reported they had, but we really enjoyed the two plus hours we lingered.    Great show for a $15 admission fee!    We could not RECOMMEND IT MORE!"
31,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Aug 2021,not available,"Salt Lake City, UT ","Excellent art museum, focused on the outdoors","An excellent museum in a beautiful building, worth seeing no matter what kind of art you like.

The works are mainly paintings, but the Museum has sculptures, ceramics, and more. It's terrific, and is located on a hillside above the National Elk Refuge."

We all really enjoyed it, including our 11-year-old son. The view is lovely from the top, and the artwork was very interesting. I like how they have it arranged in chronological order so you can see how art has evolved through time."
37,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Jul 2021,not available, ,Beautiful Museum,Wonderful museum with beautiful wildlife art and education.

38,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Jul 2021,not available,"Kent, WA ",Not to be missed,Our family of six adults visited the museum on our last day as the museum is located close to the Jackson airport. Amazing art of all types - mainly paintings and sculptures - was on display. We especially liked the temporary Andy Warhol exhibit highlighting species on the verge of extinction. Many thought provoking pieces make you think about human's impact to wildlife and nature.

Paintings, sculpture, the collection is vast and its a wonderful way to spend a few hours. Even hubby enjoyed wandering through the many rooms. We sat a few times and studied a few of the oil paintings that were amazingly lifelike. The bear and wolf were my favorites. We strolled through the outdoor exhibit of metal art afterwards and were impressed by the cleanliness of the entire area, inside and out. We didn't stay for a meal from the restaurant but the menu looked interesting. We highly recommend the museum if you are a fan of wildlife art."

At the time we visited, it wasn't crowded, allowing for time to leisurely enjoy the art while feeling safe during COVID restrictions.

I highly recommend planning a few hours when in Jackson Hole to take a tour of the magnificent artwork and have a delicious lunch as well at this museum. What amazed me the most was some of the artwork on display that was done in the early 1800s by artists who traveled to this region of Wyoming. Upon their return to the Eastern United States, they would then paint what they witnessed for those back East to get a glimpse of what they saw. (Mirrorless digital cameras I guess were not around 200 years ago...) All kidding aside, this should be a ""must see"" for anyone traveling to Jackson Hole."

77,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2020 , Solo,"Arlington, VA, ",A worthy collection,"The NMWA is an easily-accessible museum right outside Jackson. It is built to look like an outcropping on the hillside where it’s located. There are panoramic views from multiple viewpoints inside and outside the building. The exterior grounds include bronze animal sculptures. The bulk of the collection is paintings and sculptures in about ten small galleries. Aside from a handful of ancient pieces, most of the works date are from the last few centuries, from Romanticism to contemporary works. There’s also a gallery of new paintings and sculpture for sale, an inviting guest lounge with a fireplace and view of the mountains, and an upscale restaurant.    The quality of the collection was mixed, with some of it looking barely better than paint-by-number, but there are real gems here including works by Rousseau and Georgia O’Keefe. The museum also has very helpful signage and an app-based “self-guided tour” that really helps to engage with the works and understand how they fit into the genre or even an individual artist’s oeuvre. This museum is the right size and variety for a narrow-focus collection and was very different than anything I have seen before. It was well-worth the two hours it took to see everything here."

97,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Jan 2020,not available,HUDSON ,Beautiful Building and Beautiful Art,"I thought this museum would be good, but I thought the art would have to be from fairly contemporary artists. I was, therefore, very surprised to see a Moran and a Wyeth etc. The Moran portrayed a buffalo stampede at night caused by a wild fire. The leading edge of the buffalo herd was miles wide. The scene was something that must have happened but that no human could have experienced and lived to tell about it...a real nightmare, but beautiful I was really taken in by it. The dining area was very attractive but we didn't eat there. I can easily recommend the museum to anyone who likes wildlife art. I was surprised that such a small town could have such great pieces...someone must have been very generous."

99,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2019,not available,"Valhalla, NY, ",Nice Museum,It was an overcast rainy day as we headed from Yellowstone to Jackson. As such our float trip on the Snake River was cancelled and we didn't spend as much time in the Grand Teton's as a result we stopped here on our way into Jackson.    This is a great option if the weather isn't the best. Lots of nice paintings depicting western wildlife and wildlife themes in several different art forms. When we were there they were running an art contest which took up several of the galleries so I'm not sure what would be hung there if the contest wasn't going on.
100,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Oct 2019,not available,"Huntington Beach, CA, ",Unexpected Pleasure,"Another hotel guest happened to ask what we had planned for our stay in Jackson. When I mentioned touring Grand Teton National Park he said, ""Well don't miss the National Museum of Wildlife Art if you have time. And that is how we ended up stopping by.    The facility itself is a work of art in itself perched as it is on the hillside above Route 191. It the rock facade blends in with its surroundings. From the street it does not appear that big but looks are deceiving.    Entering from the parking lot you walk (or use the elevator) down a majestic stair case while a bronze mountain lion glares over your shoulder. The museum houses both paintings and sculptures with descriptions of the era in which the artist worked and the significance of their work. In addition there is a sculpture garden outside the building that you can walk through while overlooking the National Elk Refuge.    There was a very modest entrance fee of $12.00. It was very much worth the price of admission."
101,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Oct 2019,not available, ,Magnificent All Around!,"This was the biggest unexpected hightlight of my five-week road trip. The building, sculpture garden, and art collection are all stunning. Volunteers at the front desk were delightful and my retired military ID yielded a deep discount on the cost of admission.  I spent the better part of a day here and was fortunate to visit during their annual fund-raiser, in which dozens of top artists donate a portion of the sale of their work to the museum. I felt it a rare privileged to be able to examine wonderful pieces in a broad range of styles and mediums that will soon disappear from public view, into private collections.  The permanent collection features entire rooms of work by renowned wildlife artists Carl Rungious and Robert F. Kuhn (I have two new favorite painters!) and a current exhibit examines art through the ages, reaching back 25,000 years and around the globe.  If you enjoy art and love wildlife, this is a MUST SEE when visiting the Jackson/Grand Tetons area."

Between my senior discount and his military discount, it was a pretty inexpensive couple of hours.  As with any museum, my attention to detail declined the longer we were there, but the first exhibit was the one I was most interested in, so I spent a lot of time on that one. And it was excellent.  I have to admit to some disappointment that painters like James Audubon and Maynard Reece were totally overlooked.  However, the Herb Alpert Totem exhibit was amazing."

There are striking black totems that are visible from the road, which are the work of Herb Alpert ( yes, the musician and producer).    I suppose if works of art whose theme is the natural world are not your preference, you:MIGHT not enjoy the museum, but I really doubt it.    The museum is not large, and it can be appreciated in a reasonable amount of time. I truly loved it. They have an absolutely wonderful gift shop.    Topping off this experience, we had a delightful lunch at Palate, the museum restaurant which overlooks the National Elk Refuge. I had the Casper Power Bowl which was INCREDIBLY generous in all of its ingredients. My husband had Trout and Chips which were fabulous.    This place is very special to me."

Outside the building is a sculpture trail with about 21 very good sculptures of wildlife. Not sure if you have to pay a museum fee to see these since they are outside.

112,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Springfield, MA ",Very Interesting Museum,"This unusually shaped museum is made of quartzite rocks from Idaho and sits on a bluff. Resembling an outcrop, it was actually inspired by the ruins of Slains Castle in Scotland. Who would have thought?    Inside are wonderful treasures depicting wildlife......magnificent paintings, bronze statues, ceramic pieces, pottery, etc. Our favorites were the large painting of one bison and the elk in the foreground with surroundings in darker colors. While there are hundreds of pieces spread throughout 14 galleries, two featured artists are Robert Kuhn and Carl Rungius. I would strongly advise having a docent bring you around because the stories of some paintings are very interesting. There is a gift shop, library and cafe.    Outside you will find numerous sculptures, some by the parking lot, some around the entrance, and others out back. There is a 3/4 mile sculpture trail well worth taking. Nice stop, well presented."

In fact, it will draw in those with little formal art education (like myself), teach you much about the art and the Greater Yellowstone area, and leave you with a greater appreciation for both. We were not able to see it all the first day so we went back the next day. We probably spent a total of 3+ hours there. Highly recommend."

We opted for the patio and ordered chicken salad sandwiches which were fresh and tasty on delicious bread served with crispy home made chips. Great service, food and view.  What was going to be a quick stop lasted for over 2 hours and really could have been longer. Their outdoor patio is a great place to have a cool drink and just relax.

Not only are many famous artists represented, but each work represents the best qualities of each artist. The setting of the museum above the elk refuge is apropos and the stone museum building is integrated into the hill as if it belongs there.

They had an abundance of oil paintings, and a few acrylic, but as far as I could find, absolutely no watercolors, and very few of other types of 2-D medium. My husband said they are constrained by what they are endowed, but perhaps the acquisitions director should work to find some other medium to obtain, or borrow for the long term.

This time of the year certain Sundays are offered free of admission along with children’s art/craft program and entertainment by local musicians!

The architecture blends into the hillside and can easily be missed. Once inside opening into a large atrium with magnificent sculptures and majestic stairway you get the feel of how well thought out the space is. Once inside following through the galleries of magnificent paintings and sculptures is awe inspiring. Seeing Batemans Giant Bison in person is chilling, all are fabulous.

The children's area is so enjoyable for the kids. There is space to sketch, color, or make your own postcard. Kids could dress up as animals or read in the reading nook. It was a great break from the harsh cold. We particularly enjoyed the viewing area of the elk refuge. If you have a chance definitely check it out."

269,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Nov 2018 , Friends,"Chauvin, LA ",Mangelsen Exhibit Worth the Visit,"Even if you’ve visited the museum before, there is an exhibit of the work of wildlife photographer Thomas Mangelsen that will be on display at the museum until May, 2019, that you’ve got to see. If you know Mangelsen’s work, you know why this would be a special visit. There are about 40 of his photographs on display, including some of his most iconic images of grizzly and polar bears, gorillas and other animals. The rest of the artwork at the museum is exceptional for what it is. Frankly, I’m not a big fan of wildlife art, so I breezed through the rest of the galleries fairly quickly. My favorite pieces of art at the museum were actually the stupendous sculptures in the driveway and parking lots. (You don’t even have to go into the museum and pay the $14 admission fee to see them.) and there’s also a pretty good gift shop, where I finished up my Christmas shopping for nieces and nephews.    But the Mangelsen exhibit is the story here. Check it out before it goes away in May."

They let us substitute one of the cheeses on the cheese board. It was tasty.

277,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Oct 2018,not available,"Cape Cod, MA ",A Morning well spent,"I love art and art museums. I particularly like them when they are well curated with all types of art and a manageable size. This museum had paintings that were unusual in their subject presentation, as well as classically painted more familiar subjects. The art of Carl Rungius was not something I had seen before and was breathtaking. The substance of the animals and stunning backgrounds thrilled me. We had been through the parks and some of the animals appeared in his work as if we encountered them ourselves. Marvelous!  Sculptures abound inside and outside. They are so realistic and then so whimsical in their interpretation.    The thing that moved me to tears, very unexpectedly, was a large piece by Steve Kestrel. Called Silent Messenger, a raven carved in Wyoming Black Granite and red sandstone sarcophagus was very simply amazing. I sat and watched the video provided adjacent to this treasured carving. I felt as if I were in my worship place, it was that moving.  Photography by Thomas D Mangelsen was outstandingly presented and you may remember him on 60 Minutes. A joyful and vibrant depiction of animals and nature. The lighting in his photography was exceptionally bold and it transforms you into the piece itself.  There was a studio from another well known painter who's name escapes me. I loved the insider view of the studio.  October was quiet and I did see the restaurant, but did not stay for a bite.Gift shop had many treasures and lots for the kids. Please support this wonderful place, savor it and take the time to enjoy every part of it. Go alone if there are people that will hurry you through."

279,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Oct 2018 , Couples,Minnesota ,A must see,"This was on my list of things to see while visiting Jackson and I wasn’t sure if my husband would like it but he went along with me. Turned out, he loved it as much as I did. Beautiful paintings, sculptures and we were fortunate enough to see Thomas Mangelsen’s awesome photography. He is a local nature photographer who has been all over the world shooting spectacular photos of animals and landscapes. What a talented photographer! They also have a 30 minute mini movie on Mangelsen and the clip from a recent interview on 60 minutes with Anderson Cooper. We spent almost 3 hours here and it is well worth the admission fee. They have a nice gift shop and even a restaurant, which we didn’t try. Highly recommend visiting this great museum when in Jackson."

While there are countless art galleries in downtown Jackson (and those are fun to visit as well), what sets this museum apart is its historical emphasis. It's really interesting to see the depiction of wildlife in art evolve from early days when all art was dominated by the Bible and religious scenes, to much more naturalistic depictions, to very modern takes. The building is quite attractive, too. There's a cafe, but we didn't stop in it."

Wyeth, Mark Catesby, Friedrich Wilhelm Kuhnert, Robert Bateman, even Rodin, Picasso, Rembrandt, Andy Warhol and Georgia O'Keefe. The 51,000-square-foot building with its Idaho quartzite facade was inspired by the ruins of Slains Castle in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and echoes the hillside behind the facility. Located on a bluff called East Gros Ventre Butte in the midst of a real wildlife habitat, the museum overlooks the National Elk Refuge and is situated 2.5 miles north of Jackson. The core of the art collections reflects traditional and contemporary realism. The centerpiece is a collection of works by Carl Rungius and Bob Kuhn. In addition to 14 galleries, the museum also has a Sculpture Trail, Museum Shop, Restaurant, Library and Children's Discovery Gallery. Founded in 1987, it was originally situated on the Jackson Town Square and was called the Wildlife of the American West Museum. In 1994, it was moved to its current location, across Highway 89 from the National Elk Refuge. The 3/4-mile Sculpture Trail, designed by award-winning architect Walter J. Hood, opened in 2011. It extends to the north and south of the museum. It holds 30 permanent and temporary works of art. The Museum Shop offers apparel and accessories that resonate with the theme of wildlife, including books, home furnishings, children's gifts, fine jewelry, stationery, posters and prints. In 1994, the museum received the Wyoming Humanities Award for exemplary efforts in fostering the humanities in Wyoming."

What a treasure! It was busy, even in October, but not so much that the crowd made movement slow. This was a good thing since I hate lines and normally move through museums and galleries quickly. Not this time but only because the artwork was enthralling and beautiful. Quite honestly, I spent more time in here than I did in the art museum in Chicago. And make sure you walk the trails outside the museum, slowing down to appreciate the vistas over the National Elk Refuge toward the Curtis Canyon overlook (where you should also drive up a bumpy road).

300,National_Museum_of_Wildlife_Art,Sep 2018 , Couples,"United Kingdom, ",Somewhere to revisit as time allows,"What a fantastic museum and to think I've been to Jackson twice before and never visited. It covers wildlife art in various forms including pottery, sculpture and painting in various mediums. It is also trying to encompass world art so whilst there are plans to extend to Asia, most noticeably missing at present is art from China, Japan, India and Australasia and surprisingly little First Nation art. No Audubon, although there are some by a relative.    There are various galleries, some with changing exhibitions and some dedicated to one artist or style. I found the layout confusing even with a map, although it doesn't matter what order you do things in, so we kept backtracking.    We arrived mid afternoon so the café had closed by the time we'd finished wandering - you do need to allow a couple of hours minimum and then there's the sculpture trail outside which is well worth a look. There's also a very good gift shop and they allow photography of the art works which is unusual.    It's on the road between Yellowstone and Jackson and is a stone building created to blend in with the surroundings, but you can't miss it as there's a large sculpture outside."

Its architecture mimics the ruins of a Scottish castle, nestled into the side of the Teton Range and overlooking the 25,000 acre National Elk Refuge. There are stunning views outside and inside. An entire room devoted to Carl Rungius is a highlight, but paintings and sculptures by the most prominent US and European wildlife artists of the past 150 years are beautifully curated and displayed.

Housed in a beautifully designed building inside and out, this contains some really wonderful wildlife art.

Entering the galleries you are immediately confronted by Robert Bateman’s stunning Bison study “Chief”. What imagery, power and pathos there is in this wonderful painting.
