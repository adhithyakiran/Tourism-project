1,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2021 , Solo,"Lafayette, LA ",Vacation,Loved my drive here. It’s a slow and beautiful drive. It makes you think and appreciate what we have now. To think how these settlers made it. It’s somber the hardships they endured.
2,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2021,not available,"Jefferson, GA ",Wonderful Drive Within Sight of Grand Tetons,"We drove through the classic Antelope Flats, past the old Mormon row, and back to Kelly Warm Springs. We love a scenic drive and this one had antelopes scattered about and an abundance of birds. The warm spring had minnows."
3,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2021,not available,Winston-Salem NC ,Scenic views!,"Antelope Flats is always on the top of my list to visit when I am in Jackson Hole. The views of the Tetons are gorgeous especially when the wildflowers are in bloom and Mormow Row is both Historic and beautiful! It's one of my favorite places in Jackson Hole. The only disappointment on this trip is we didn't see any bison like we have in the pas,t but I still highly recommend a drive through Antelope Flats!"
4,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2021,not available,"Colorado Springs, CO ",Road to Historic District,"Antelope Flats is the road that leads to the Mormon Row Historic District. I personally thought the barns were a little boring, but you do get great views of the Tetons. We got here a little late in the day and my phone had died by then, so unfortunately I didn't get any pictures."
5,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2021,not available,"San Diego, CA ","Where early settlers tried to tame the land, farm and ranch","Interesting history of Mormon settlers planting wheat, building homes and barns, trying to ranch but ending up selling their land to the park service."
6,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2021,not available,"Tampa, FL ",Wildflowers and more,"Our youngest loves wildflowers and the park rangers at the Grand Teton Visitor Center recommended we detour through Antelope Flats to see what was blooming.  We are very glad they did.    Antelope Flats not only offered lots of flowers, it is the site of the original Mormon Settlement. I have Mormon ancestors so I have a sense of Mormon history and found the settlement intriguing. There are homesteads, barns and other out building.  Visitors are allowed to walk around and through the buildings to get a sense of life 'back then'. Our girls were fascinated by the mules lol.    We also saw a herd of antelope, large enough to cause plenty of people to pull over for photos.    Our daughter got a kick out of walking through and identifying the various flowers. The area, surrounded by the mountains, is quite lovely and peaceful. Definitely worth a detour."
7,Antelope_Flats,May 2021,not available,"San Antonio, TX ",Mormon barn is still classic,The Sears Robuck house is still under renovation but you can't take anything away from the Barn. Classic and well worth the trip
8,Antelope_Flats,May 2021,not available,"Bay City, MI ",A place to View Antelope,This is one place to view the many antelope in the Teton National Park area. Not only antelope but some times bison and elk. This was one of the easier places to view that type of wildlife.

11,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2020,not available,"Seattle, WA, ",The classic photo spot,Get there early or be prepared for parking problems. It's a small spot spread out across a couple of locations. Photo classes and enthusiasts set up early only to be frustrated by last minute tourists that arrive and run out into the frame to take their picture.  My advice is show up early and be sensitive to those that are behind you when you take your picture. Parking may be further away than you expect due to the crowds.    The subject (old mormon farm buildings) are spectacular against the backdrop of the Teton range and it makes most of us look like we are better photographers than actually true.
12,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2020,not available, ,Scenic compared to anywhere,"The Grand Teton Mountains are some of the most beautiful in the world. If you possibly can, you want to see these."

Go early as the sun is coming up - and don't rush it. Just enjoy the ride and the experience. A nice morning would be to start at Antelope Flats and then go on to Oxbow Bend."

16,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2020,not available,"Sugar Land, TX ",Don't Miss this Iconic Photo Opportunity,An iconic photo stop for visitors to Grand Teton N.P. Get there early for the morning sun when photos are best taken. The historic T.A.

20,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2020 , Couples, ,Stepping back in time,Loved the old barns and history behind them! Reminded me of Little House on the Prairie. Definitely worth the stop and possibility of seeing wildlife as well
21,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2020,not available,"York, ME, ",Great scenic drive!,Great scenic drive and a recommended drive to see wildlife. I was surprised how few cars I saw driving around. Lots of great places to take photos including Mormon Row and the Moulton Barn. Watch you step as the ground squirrels (looks like a small prairie dog) had dug a lot of holes.
22,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2020 , Couples,"Madison, MS ",Neat stop for photos,Last stop on our half day Grand Teton tour with ecotour. Highly recommend! Apparently this is the most photographed barn in America. It was beautiful from every angle.
23,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2020,not available,"Cypress, CA ",Must stop for Photographers,A really beautiful place to photograph. These old barns are in such a beautiful setting with the Grand Tetons behind them. We saw pronghorn here too.
24,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2020,not available,"Houston, TX ",Great photo opportunity,"The circa 1890's barns and buildings of this former Mormon homestead make for a great photo opportunity. With the Teton Mountain backdrop, this is a must stop on your visit to Grand Teton National Park."

29,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2019,not available, ,"Beautiful, iconic photos.","Beautiful views of the Tetons from the flatlands. Fun to see antelope, bison, and other wildlife. We saw this area as part of an EcoTour and loved it!"
30,Antelope_Flats,Dec 2019,not available, ,?History and beauty,"The most photographed barn in the United States sits on Mormon Row in Antelope Flats just outside Jackson Hole and just beyond the Elk Refuge. You can drive directly there in the summer or hike/snowshoe the mile distance in the winter. Visit the most famously photographed barn in the US, the Moulton Barn, and take in the wonderment, beauty and power of the Tetons."
31,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2019,not available,"Leuven, Belgium ",One of THE places to visit,"You want to visit here, because - you want to have a photo of the most famous barn in Wyoming, but also because you have a chance to see bison here, pronghorn and other animals. The landscape is fascinating and the mountains look always different!"
32,Antelope_Flats,Oct 2019,not available,"Coral Springs, FL ",Saw many antelope,We stopped here several times for Mormon Row and the Antelope. It is beautiful. We loved watching the animals and taking photos of the buildings.
33,Antelope_Flats,Oct 2019 , Couples,"Shediac, Canada ",Beautiful background,Although it was late in the year for tourists it was probably the best time for taking pictures since there was considerably less people to deal with and we could get our pics with only the landscape. The weather was cooler but it was good for travelling. The scenery was gorgeous. You sometimes need to to take the time to go off the main road to find your great photo.
34,Antelope_Flats,Oct 2019,not available,"Mattoon, IL ",great picturesque drive,"nice drive to view wildlife!!, bison.elk, and other wildlife to be seen with a great mountain backdrop. also a couple of old Mormon structures to view"
35,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2019 , Couples,"Henderson, NC ","Vistas, animals, historic buildings","My husband and I drove across Antelope Flats to see Mormon Row. The road is unpaved but not too rough. Just be aware that you need to go slower. As you drive through the open meadows, you have gorgeous views of the Tetons. Be on the lookout for pronghorns. We saw more than a dozen as we drove by. Those were the only animals we saw that day, but elk, bison, and others roam there as well. Mormon Row is so very photogenic and worth a visit."
36,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2019 , Friends,"Gainesville, FL ",Iconic Beauty,"Stunning photo opportunities and history. Home of the most photographed barn in the country, this is one of the free things you can do in Jackson Hole. For those who are disappointed that they didn't see antelope please remember that this is not a zoo. The name doesn't always indicate that there will be antelope. If you base your visit just on antelope sightings then you are severely missing out."
37,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2019,not available,"Granbury, TX ",Iconic,"Really a simple set of buildings you can see anywhere, but the backdrop of the mountains makes this a must see if you want a great picture of the Teton mountain range. So very inspiring."

41,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2019,not available,"Bossier City, LA ",We may have been there at the wrong time of the year but nothing really worth seeing.,"Not sure what else to say. We drove around, didn't see much except a wide open field and a few houses and some pens. Didn't see a single antelope."
42,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2019,not available,"Toano, VA ",Very historic,There are the old settlements that are still standing here. Place was really interesting and the view was wonderful. Looked right across at the Tetons.
43,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2019,not available,"Harrison, AR ",Mormon Row,"One of the great Grand Tetons photo ops . The barn is a classic but all the other builds offer many great (less seen) pictures... For my photo experience the best times are daybreak up till about 10 am , the worst drawback is the crowds and people who walk in front of you while trying to shoot pics"
44,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2019,not available,"Woodlawn, IL ",Perfect setting for pics,The Moulton barn and surrounding area is a treasure for pics. I was happy to read the area was recently purchased to be preserved.
45,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2019,not available,"Austin, TX ",So much wildlife,"This is a beautiful drive. We did it twice, once with our BrushBuck Tour and then again on our own.

46,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2019,not available,"Elkview, WV ",Gorgeous Scenery,"For a chance viewing of wildlife and gorgeous scenery, take a drive out Antelope Flats. The famous Moulton barns provide another photo op. Just beautiful. Be forewarned you may travel on a gravel road that's quite dusty but worth the experience."
47,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2019 , Couples, ,"This is not a bike trail, and shouldn’t be listed by Trip Advisor as such","Antelope Flats is a narrow unpaved bumpy road with no bike lane and barely enough room for two vehicles to pass each other in both directions. There are so many bike paths throughout the park that are ideally suited for cyclists, I think it is irresponsible for it to be promoted for bicycles. The Morgan barns used to be a nice photo op, but there are now too many people visiting them at all times of day and night."
48,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2019,not available,"Chicopee, MA ",Beautiful Area,We took photos of Mormon Row and also saw a lot of bison along the area. Great photos with the Tetons in the background. Take the time to go off the route and see this area.

52,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2019,not available,"Madisonville, KY ",Always a first stop,Antelope Flats is always a first stop as I head through GTNP. With the mountains as backdrop you'll find so many great scenes to photograph. There's a peacefulness here. On my last visit there was a small group of mule deer in the early evening.
53,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2019,not available,"Bellaire, TX ",Best in early morning,"We loved driving around to take pictures of the most photographed areas, and this was one of them. Worthwhile."
54,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2019,not available,"Blairsville, GA ","History, scenery and wildlife",Enjoyed a ride out to see and photograph these famous barns and drive around the area. The views of the spectacular Teton Mountains were amazing.    Hats off to the early pioneers for their trials and struggles.
55,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2019 , Family,"Harrison, AR ",Barn photo,"This was on my bucket list, but it wasn't as grand as I hoped for when we stopped by. There was a professional photographer there taking engagement photos so we felt as if we were rushed not to be in their way. Later we had some older locals drop by and give us the historical significance of the site. That made up for the rushed feeling. We did take the Mormon road back into Jackson and saw several mule deer, prong horns, and bison. Best time was after the heat of the day and when the mountains begin to provide shade for the wildlife."
56,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2019 , Family,"Lower Gwynedd, PA ",Great place for a bike ride,"Did a 10 mile tour along the roads and trial here. Saw historic hoesteads, bison and antelope. Very flat, easy ride. Good for the whole family."
57,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2019 , Friends, ,great place for photos,"Quiet spot and very photogenic. Great to visit at dawn to very early morning or late afternoon to catch the most interesting light. Buffalo were nearby, Just close enough to be visible in the pictures"
58,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2019 , Family,Saratoga ,Mormon Row day or night,I went out during the late afternoon and then again at night to take photos. It is peaceful and beautiful.
59,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Family,"Muskego, WI ",Amazing Views,"The wildlife was great here. We saw a herd of buffalo and then a little down the road, there was a couple of Pronghorns being chased by an elk. The views of the Tetons from here are amazing. The barns and green grass are great in the photos too. It was a 10-15 minute stop for us just to enjoy and take some pictures."
60,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Family, ,photos are amazing,My photos taken here are amazing. You get the beautiful Tetons and the green of the pasture. But the best are the clouds in the sky and behind the mountains.

63,Antelope_Flats,Apr 2019 , Family,"Jackson, WY ",Great opportunity to see some local wildlife,"Depending on the time of year you may see Big Horn Sheep, Mule Deer, Moose, Geese, Coyotes, or perhaps even a Wolf. Drive slowly and keep your eyes open."
64,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019,not available,"Jacksonville, NC ",Beautiful Scenery,"We visited Antelope Flats 3 times while in Jackson, Wyoming. I was just trying to find the best time of day for lighting and clear weather. The third time was a charm."
65,Antelope_Flats,May 2019,not available,"Nyons, France ",STUNNING,"The views on the mountains are absolutely stunning from here. We didn't visit any of the buildings in detail, but they added to the character of the photos. Leaving the Mormon buildings, we came across a small herd of bison...I wanted to start singing ""Home on the range""!"
66,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Cape Coral, FL ",Stunning panorama,"Staying in Gros Ventre, this was a short trip down Mormon Row. Once we got past the hills that block the campground from the Tetons, we saw a stunning sight of the major peaks of the Teton range. It was absolutely breathtaking."
67,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Family,"Tyler, Texas, USA ",Breathtaking Beauty,Stopped at Antelope Flats to see the iconic over photographed barn with the backdrop of the Tetons as well as the pink stucco house the Mormons seemed compelled to build that I am sure would have made John Smith proud! Enjoyed the scenery as well as all the little prairie dogs scurrying about...watch out for the holes!
68,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Family,"Charlotte, NC, ","Come for the views, great for the kiddos!","We came to Antelope Flats to get the iconic views of Grand Teton, but honestly it was a great area for our kids who had been locked up in the car for the better part of the day driving around the park. The kids very much enjoyed getting to play in some of the crystal clear streams running through the area, as well as chasing the prairie dogs around the area, provided lots of fun for the little ones. Definitely recommend stopping by for the iconic view, but if you have little kids, this is a great opportunity for them to stretch their legs and be a kid."
69,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Couples,"New York, New York, United States ",Breathtaking scenery,Has to be one of my all time favorite views. It's still with me now as I travel home. We stayed in the Gros Ventre Campground but this hidden gem of a farm was a real treat to see.
70,Antelope_Flats,May 2019,not available, ,Great venue for photography,Worth a visit out to Mormon Row. Great place to take photos of the spectacular Tetons! Saw lots of bison in the area.
71,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",YES,And there are lots of Antelope. The drive around this area was spectacular and you should have your camera ready at all times.
72,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Family, ,Teton/yellowstone Vacation,The scenery at this place was beautiful. This was one of my favorite place to take pictures with the Teton mountains in the background
73,Antelope_Flats,May 2019 , Friends,northbrook il ,every one stops here,"no one comes to the tetons and does not stop at antelope flats,,,,,the old home the barn with the peaks behind it the classic teton stop"
74,Antelope_Flats,May 2019 , Couples,"Chicago, IL ",Do you want to find moose?,"We have traveled here in the fall and also spring and it has never failed to see moose near the river, in the fields and at Moulton Barn area. Of course, the TRICK is to get up EARLY in the morning (such as 5:30 AM on!)"
75,Antelope_Flats,Jun 2019 , Couples,"Branson, MO, ",Must stop,"Beautiful and iconic photo stop in the Tetons. Absolutely worth the time to stop, took all of 5 min."
76,Antelope_Flats,May 2019 , Solo,"Walnut Creek, CA ",Photographers Heaven,"Several barns on Mormon Row with the snow-covered mountains in the background. I visited here each of my three days in Jackson. The weather changes constantly, so you don’t get the same picture. Rain, sun, cloudy, dark, you name it. Bring your camera. You may see some Elk or a Moose here too."
77,Antelope_Flats,May 2019 , Friends,"Jackson, WY ",Both excellent scenic and wildlife viewing.,"A short drive from Jackson places you on the Gros Ventre Loop road that runs up past the town of Kelly then the option to head up into the Gros Ventre Mountains with excellent view of lakes and the Gros Vente Slide. Or follow the loop road that runs up to Shadow Mountain and Mormon Row historical area. Usually can spot buffalo herds in most months, moose in winter, elk and deer."
78,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2018,not available,"Atlanta, GA ",Wonderful!,"The whole area is perfection. If you go to Antelope Flats, go early in the morning to catch Morman Row. There are no bathrooms out in the fields, so make sure you ""go before you go"". The roads are dirt and kick up dust from the cars when dry, so fyi.    The first time I went @ 6:00 am, well before sunrise and I got some awesome pics of the clouds rising out of the valley as the sun came up. The 2nd time I went mid-day and it was still spectacular and I still got some good pics but there were tourists there who were taking photos in front of the bar, then changing clothes and re-taking the photos while a ton of other people were standing around waiting for them to get out of the way so they could get a picture without a subject. My advice is if you want to do a full on photo-shoot, pick a time of day when folks don't have to stand around and wait on your happy butt for 20 mins to take one photo. Eventually, I asked them to get out of the way. Nicely. And they did.    The Tetons in the background make for an amazing site and I wholeheartedly recommend a stop by."
79,Antelope_Flats,Feb 2019 , Couples,"Fredericksburg, VA ",Mormon barns are a must see,"These barns are some of the most photographed in the US. Iconic. The history behind them is very interesting, and the views of the barns with the Tetons behind them......breathtaking."
80,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2018 , Solo,Illinois ,A low key must see,"Well worth the short drive outside of Jackson Hole: The Grand Tetons seem within reach. For best photographs, early morning here is the best for lighting. And please be aware, a number of photographers may be around: be courteous when and where you walk"
81,Antelope_Flats,Nov 2018 , Business,Springdale ,Always love visiting the barns,"However, I am upset about the number of wedding and posed photography that goes on at the barns - the photographers park in the road and take over the entire place for hours at a time. Some times there is more than one wedding in a day and people who traveled from all over the world to visit these icons of GTNP, can't get a photo. There should be a limited schedule that can be published and the weddings should take place at high noon when there are few visitors to the area."
82,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2018 , Couples,"Florence, KY ",One of the Most Popular Photographs Taken,This area is all flat in the valley. The Mormon Barn is probably one of the most recognized photos taken. There is also a lot of wildlife in the area. Saw lots of prawn horn and popular moose watching area was nearby even though we did not see them. Classic piece of history.
83,Antelope_Flats,Jul 2018 , Family,"Costa Mesa, CA, ",Beautiful Area,"We drove through here on a whim, not exactly knowing what to expect. Glad we decided to cut through here. This is a beautiful location with some great photo opportunities. Didn't see a whole lot of wildlife on our trip as we visited about 3:00 PM but it was worth the drive just for the scenery."
84,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2018 , Family,"Charlotte, NC ",Great photo ops,Lots of bison and the Grand Teton views are beautiful. It is fun to drive around and see all the beautiful scenery.
85,Antelope_Flats,Oct 2018 , Couples,"Nashville, TN ",Outstanding photo opportunities,"We were part of a Landscape Photography Workshop by Joe Brady, and Antelope Flats was one of our stops. The scenery is breathtaking!"
86,Antelope_Flats,Oct 2018,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",One of the most epic locations in America,"A visit to Grand Teton National Park in northwestern Wyoming isn't complete without a trip to Antelope Flats, one of the most epic locations in the American West with views of the entire Teton Range and abundant wildlife. This 640-acre stretch of land was established to preserve critical habitats and migration routes for a variety of species. It also provides visitors with a taste of the Old West, complete with old homesteads and spectacular mountain views. From Jackson, drive north on Highway 189. After you pass Moose Junction (the entrance to Grand Teton National Park), you will see Blacktail Butte on your left. Drive a bit further and just beyond the butte you will see a right hand turn which is Antelope Flats Road. After several miles you will come to a junction with several structures on your left and a dirt road on your right. The structures are abandoned homesteaders' barns and houses from the turn of the 20th century, part of the famous Mormon Row barns. Take the dirt road another mile and you will find the T.A. Moulton Barn, one of the most famous in the world. Antelope Flats Road can be linked up to the Gros Ventre-Kelly Road for a big loop. This will take you through the small town of Kelly and along the Gros Ventre River. It's a great way to see moose, bison, pronghorn antelope, badgers, coyotes, the largest elk herd in the West, raptors and much more, a photographer's dream."
87,Antelope_Flats,Oct 2018 , Friends,phoenix ,it's not where you think it is,"it was cold. I'm from Phoenix. I didn't get out. But the 'Mormon' row, eh, why bother? The REAL barn is across the street, not where the cluster of buildings is. For me, what's the point? You can't go inside. But, there's a road across from here, there is a private residence on it. DRIVE SLOWLY, don't kick up the dust for them to clean. Just past it, it says, '4 wheel drive recommended'. Not when it's dry. No washboard, gravel, but smooth and cuts off a ton of miles from going around. And it's the path less taken. Isn't that what travel is all about?"
88,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2018 , Couples,"United Kingdom, ",A piece of history preserved,"Known particularly for Mormon Row, the collection of old farm buildings, Antelope Flats is more than this and if you drive the roads there's a chance of seeing Bison and Pronghorn as we did on our way to Gros Ventre.    Mormon Row however is well worth a stop. You can park at one end and walk the road and drive the other side, although 4WD is recommended beyond the last house. One of the houses is now a B&B but the others are in various states of repair - none can be visited within which is a shame.    If you're lucky you can get fantastic views of the buildings with the jagged peaks of the Tetons behind - unfortunately there was a wildfire creating smoke across the mountains the days we were there."
89,Antelope_Flats,Aug 2018,not available,"East Brady, PA ",Mormon Row,"Early pioneering Mormon families settled in the region near Jackson, WY, called Mormon Row, were the close knit families farmed and raised their children.

They were brothers and built themselves great looking barns. The barns with the Grand Tetons for a background make postcard quality photos. If the weather is right, you can also get cool sunrise, sunset, or both types of shots. Rub shoulders with professional photographers while you are there. Feel free to ask them advice about camera technique and composure, as long as you are courteous and don't get in the way of their shots!

The park service has now added a drive/park slab of cement, porta potties, and rather changed the natural rustic appearance of the grounds. The best place to photograph this is down the road and back in the field. Up close you don't get the beautiful perspective that you do from far away. The best time to photograph the barn is at first light when the sun rises and hits the barn with that beautiful first light of day. Hope for a beautiful blue sky with lots of fluffy clouds and you will have a winner of a photo. Sometime the buffalo the roam around and you have to be aware. I have had them, in the past come close, and I just sat there, very quietly and didn't move. He went away. This is probably the most photographed barn in the USA."

Somewhere around the turnoff for the Science center is a big stretch where you can park and look out onto the Tetons (well, you can't miss them anywhere from Jackson, but this is a goos spot to get reflective about them!). And there were deer and lost of damsel flies and teams of technicolor moths just hatched! Great little find if you take your time going through it."

She told us to take this unpaved road from the south to get there from Jackson and I would not recommend doing that unless you have a 4 wheel drive car. The road was long and very bumpy. We did see a herd of bison grazing on the pasture so that made the trip worth it. But once we got to Mormon road we realized there was a nicely paved road to get to it from the North side instead of the unpaved road from the South.    Mormon row is very small but a great side trip and worth the quick visit.

Not sure if Mormon Row has a separate entry so I am going to review it here......Mormon Row is signposted - turn right off Antelope Flats Road.

How these folks came here in wagons with barely their hands and a few tools is amazing. Ladies, look around and weep inside, as these women bought your place in life. Then, get back in your car and go home a better person"

We did see elk, bison, deer, horses, and water fowl, but did not see any moose or bears that evening. The Mormon Barns were very pretty and had it not been raining, we would have loved to walk around that area. As it was, the roadsides were muddy and slippery, and we chose to keep driving along the road.    This road takes you back behind the National Elk Refuge, as well as along a river and past several campsites. The road had lots of uneven spots and potholes. As you go further along the road, the surface turns to gravel, but as long as you go slowly, you can avoid most of the potholes. Although the weather was not the best, it was still a very pretty drive."

Go early in the morning to get the sunlight just right to photograph these historic buildings against the Grand Tetons. There is plenty of parking and there is a new primitive restroom on the Morman Row road (right next to Antelope Flats). There are tour buses that will arrive later in the day so if you want photos without a lot of strangers in them, get there earlier in the day.

But the backdrop of the amazing Teton mountains over a broad expanse of grassland habitat for various megafauna is constantly changing and full of simple wonders. There's a lot more to be found here besides simply Mormon Row, which is wonderful for its own sake.  Thus time of the year, the antelope flats road is closed from Craighead lane to mailbox corner. Even so, the flats are much bigger than only what is seen from its namesake road. From the road to Kelly all the way to Lost Creek Ranch is all Antelope Flats, named for the pronghorn which was mistakenly called ""antelope"" because they reminded early European American settlers of African animals. Yesterday, between Kelly Warm Springs and the old McCollister place I saw 20 moose! Many were laying down, ruminating, but to a good spotter, there were there to be seen! We saw hundreds of bison, several mule deer, elk and coyotes too but every day and season is different so please be flexible."

339,Antelope_Flats,Sep 2015 , Couples,"Evanston, IL ","Original homesteader buildings, great views of the Tetons","Antelope Flats provides a snapshot of early Jackson Hole history and some iconic views of the Grand Tetons. The pleasures here are subtle and understated. The Flats are just that -- open, expansive sage flats that were once farmed. But walking this ground puts you as close to the hardy first settlers as you can get.    Starting in the early 1900s, homesteaders started staking claims to this area just east of the Snake River and under the shadow of the Tetons. The Moulton family was first, and their original barn, which you've seen in scores of classic photos with the Tetons behind it, is still there on a dirt road dubbed Mormon Row. You can walk the land, hop over the remains of the laboriously hand-dug irrigation ditches that made farming possible here in 1907, and absorb stunning views of the Tetons.    If you cross to the other side of Antelope Flats road and drive a bit south on the rutted dirt Mormon Row road, you'll see a couple of other remaining homestead barns, homes and outbuildings, as well as a small B&B still owned by descendants of the Moulton family, one of the small holdings within Grand Teton National Park still within private hands. Almost directly across the road from the Moulton's inn are the well-preserved remains of the Andy Chambers home, homesteaded in 1912. Andy's son Roy, born on the homestead, just died this summer. The deep connections to the past still resonate today.    We've traveled Antelope Flats Road literally more than a hundred times over the past 20 years. Often you'll see animals. We've frequently seen large herds of bison, sometimes hundreds of animals. And we've seen pronghorn antelope, coyotes, hawks, owls and other animals. But you can't count on it. This year on the half-dozen or so trips we made down the road over the course of a week we didn't see a single animal. So don't come here *expecting* to find animals, but be pleasantly enraptured if you do.    This isn't a site worth going far out of your way to see. But it's worth a brief side trip, if you are entering or leaving Grand Teton National Park through its Moose Junction entrance, or heading north from Jackson for a visit to Yellowstone."
