8,Town_Square50,Aug 2021,not available,Texas ,Elk Antler Arch - Great Place to Get a Photo,"At each corner of the park there are huge archways made of elk antlers. Elk yearly shed their antlers, so you don’t have to worry if the antlers are coming from elk that were shot by hunters. The antlers are reportedly collected by the Boy Scouts from the nearby National Elk Refuge and the arches are periodically rebuilt as needed. The first antler arch was built in 1953. The park, located in the center of Jackson, is a historical landmark and is very popular for picture-taking by tourists. I’ve never been there at Christmas when the antlers are decorated and lit with Christmas lights, but the pictures are beautiful. I still remember the 1st time we visited the park, which was back in the early 80’s, and my son got lost during the 4th of July parade. (PaM)"

There were tables and chairs lining the streets around the square, something I had never seen. The ambiance was lovely and I totally enjoyed myself. Another person talked about how crowded it was - I heard from many locals that this was the busiest September they had ever seen, due to Covid Escapism. I also had trouble finding parking, and getting through town north or south is extremely difficult due to road construction and congestion. But the iconic park offers cool shady seating and nice views of the area around the square. I love going solo so fighting crowds isn't a problem for me.

Bring your camera there’s the really neat antler arches at each corner of the town square you’ll wanna take pics under. And not too far out of town square is snow king area, it’s family fun. They have mini golf and mazes and a few rides and a gondola or ski lift. We rode the cowboy coaster and it was a blast. $50 for 3 of us, 2 adults and one child. We all had a blast riding that. Really crazy views up there and your kiddo can ride w you if they can’t go alone. Parks are everywhere, i can think of 3 w in the town square. There’s a neat one back by snow king area that had a rock climbing area. 3-5 structures kids and adults could climb on and tons of green grass to hang on while the kids play.

The square is a community park, albeit small in area. There are benches and walkways and some landscaping with lawn areas. The distinctive design element are the Elk antler entrance arches on each side of the square. Great for photo ops, thus the crowds that always seem to be present. Selfie's with the Elk Arches seem to be very popular.    On Saturday's an seasonal farmer's market can be found selling produce and crafts, honey etc. around the square. Also surrounding the square are a variety of merchant establishments. Wyoming Outfitters, Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, Snake River Grill, Moo's Homemade Ice Cream * Sorbet and the Stage Stop to name a few.

While visiting Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, we wanted to be sure to see the ""infamous"" Jackson Hole that we'd heard so much about. The entire area is quite beautiful with stunning mountain ranges, ski slopes, wildlife and natural wonders. We spent 1/2 day in the Town of Jackson. I tend to shy away from touristy areas (I was raised in Orlando, FL and it's not the Orlando I loved and knew since the Mouse came to town). You understand my aversion to crowds now as I rarely find myself in the area of tourism in Orlando. Jackson was busy that day, despite Covid, but EVERYONE was wearing masks which was awesome. My husband and I walked around some of the town and had to visit the cool Antler Arches at the Town Square. Very unique and photo worthy. We went into one of the shops that had some pretty and nice gift ideas for folks back home. Some things pricey but some reasonable. We stopped in for a quick bite to eat at one of the small cafes, had seen enough and headed back to our RV campsite near Yellowstone. I've seen Jackson now, got my fix. I'm good."

302,Town_Square50,Jul 2019,not available,"Richland, WA ","If you visit Jackson, WY (aka: Jackson Hole) you have to visit Jackson Town Square","George Washington Memorial Park is located at the center of Jackson, Wyoming. More generally known as ""Jackson Town Square"", the park is notable for its elk-antler arches at each corner of the park, collected from the nearby National Elk Refuge by Boy Scouts and periodically rebuilt.    The Town Square Shootout wouldn't be complete without the Elk Antler Arches! They serve as the backdrop to the longest running shootout show in the west. Visitors and locals delight in the reenactment of Old West justice carried out by professional actors summer evenings from Monday through Saturday at 6:00pm. There's no shootin' on Sundays!    Started by Chamber boosters in the 1960's the Town Square Shootout started with a wild flair that tended toward the violent. Managed by the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce with the team from the Jackson Hole Playhouse, the show is now more colorful with period costumes and plenty of playfulness    Stagecoach Rides  The Stagestop is located on the south side of Town Square, off Broadway. Visitors can enjoy a leisurely Stagecoach Ride and tour of historic Jackson Hole. Managed by the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce, fees collected from the Stagecoach help fund the Town Square Shootout.    After all of that ….. we enjoyed walking the wood plank sidewalks in downtown Jackson, checking out numerous shops, restaurants, and cowboy bars. It’s a blast!"

It is a central location, which means quick access to stores and restaurants. The downside is that it is a central location, which means it will be swamped with visitors. Still, no trip to Jackson Hole is complete without a visit here."

452,Town_Square50,Oct 2018,not available,"Chicago, IL, ",Did you count the elk antlers?,"George Washington Memorial Park, more commonly known as Town Square, is located at the center of Jackson, Wyoming, at Broadway and Cache Streets. It is most notable for its elk antler arches at each corner of the park, collected from the nearby National Elk Refuge by Boy Scouts and periodically rebuilt. The square, which also contains a stone memorial to legendary mountain man John Colter, believed to be the first American to explore the Grant Teton and Yellowstone areas, originally existed as an open space in the center of town that was made into a park in 1934. After being formally dedicated, the park soon became the center of Jackson's civic life. The Colter memorial was built in 1939. In 1953, the local Rotary Club built an arch of elk antlers at the southwest corner of the park. Arches were erected at the remaining corners in 1966, 1967 and 1969. Interestingly, it wasn't until 1976 that a plaque was placed in the park for the United States Bicentennial naming the park ""George Washington Memorial Park."" What's the lone building in the park all about? In 1959, a house originally built by Charles Wort was moved onto the square, becoming known as the ""Stage Stop."" The move was unpopular and possibly illegal but the building remained until 1995 when it was given to Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, whose grandfather had used the building as a law office. A modern replacement was built in its stead."
